There was going to be more characters to choose from in the action story other than the knight, and more types of stories like an exploration one. There is supposed to be a story going on behind the stories being told, but I decided to cut them short since I figured it was better to finish developing the game play to develop a full enough experience for what it is. So if the beginning of the game is a little out of place, I just kept it there to show there was supposed to be more.

I didn't have much time this weekend to work on this and was able only to develop for around 12ish hours (busy all Sunday and mostly Monday) but never the less, here it is.\n\nFor audiophiles; if you want to listen to some cool tracks just change tracks with the following available: \nplay dooms\nplay wors\nplay tls\nplay iatd\n\nYou can change the color too with:\nsetcolor commandline\nsetcolor terminal\nsetcolor doctorwho\n\nEven though this is done, I'm thinking about extending the game so that it's usable after this.

Coming into this we knew little about Game Design, yet we think that actually we've come out with something not half bad. It's perhaps not at a competition winning standard, but we're still very pleased that we actually managed to produce something in the time allotted.\n\nEssentially, our game is a 2D space shooter in which you pilot a spaceship and kill enemies, with the twist that anything you do slowly drains you of energy. We implemented waves of enemies that would follow you and fire various weapons at you before you face a final boss (yes it's a little cliché, but we couldn't resist).\n\n**There are 3 control modes:** (Accessed in the pause menu through the escape key)\n - Mouse Controls - Where the mouse controls rotation and WASD control movement relative to that.\n - Keyboard Controls - Where the A and D controls rotation and WSQE control movement relative to that.\n - Absolute Controls - Where the mouse controls rotation, but the ship moves according to the WASD keys absolutely (so W is always up).\n\nThe balance of the game is not entirely perfect, and it is lacking polish in some areas (such as the obvious omittance of an animation when a laser beam hit's something), but overall we're very pleased to say that it is our first game.\n\nWe hope you have fun playing it as much as we enjoyed making it.\n\n\n![Screenshot_0.png](///raw/a8b/8/z/8364.png)\n\n\n![Screenshot_2.png](///raw/a8b/8/z/8365.png)\n\n\n![Screenshot_1_Cropped.png](///raw/a8b/8/z/8368.png)\n\n\n**Change Log**\n - Fixed an issue with the instruction screen's scaling.\n - Set the default controls for the player to Absolute because people seemed to be confused by Mouse Controls.\n - Fixed the boss shock-wave effect because it was repeating indefinitely as opposed to only playing once.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a8b/8/z/8388.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/mobius-trap","author":{"name":"RedNW","uid":35722,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/rednw"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a8b/8/z/8364.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a8b/8/z/8364.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a8b/8/z/8365.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a8b/8/z/8365.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a8b/8/z/8368.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a8b/8/z/8368.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://rkdelta.itch.io/mobius-trap"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Breaker Breaker!","category":"jam","description":"![BreakerBreakerTitleBig.png](///raw/6ab/1/z/88c6.png)\n\n**Ludum Dare 39 Theme: \"Running Out Of Power\"**\n\n**CONTROLS**\n\n- _Mouse_: Aim\n- _Right Mouse Button (HELD)_: Thrust\n- _Right Mouse Button (CLICK)_: Repair Engine\n- _Left Mouse Button / Spacebar_: Shoot\n- _R Key_: Restart\n\n** _Breaker Breaker_ ** is our LD39 submission, where you control a plane with a terrible engine that breaks down constantly.

The planet, which have two cycles-a blue and a yellow day, greeted our hero with the death of the crew.\nThe reason that character survived is pretty simple - he is a small robot, being nothing more than a service staff.\nHowever, he has intelligence...

Thanks a lot for checking out my game!\n\nIt's been a long time since I last joined in with a Ludum Dare - and I wasn't going to submit anything for this one, either, thanks to a busy weekend. But inspiration struck me on Sunday evening (of course!) and I just had to see if I could whip something up. Since I wasn't able to get to a computer until after midnight, this game wasn't made in 72 hours, or 48 - it was made in 24.\n\nNeedless to say, it's -very- short! I had a lot of stuff planned for it, but I decided to make something tiny and polished rather than try to cram all my ideas in. Hopefully you'll still enjoy it, even if there's barely any game to play.\n\n![Assets.png](///raw/3b5/b/z/7d7e.png)\n\nHere's a load of stuff I had ready for it, just to give you an idea of what I would have done with more time.\n\n----------------\n\nYou've woken up in a very strange place, locked in a very strange cell... So strange, in fact, that it's rocket-powered. Maybe you can find a way out?\n\n--- Controls ---\n\nUse WASD or the arrow keys to boost until you hit a block. Alternatively, click towards the edges of the screen to boost in that direction (use the background to guide you with your clicks). Be careful - you have a limited number of charges per level!\n\nRestart any stage by either clicking on the 'R' in the top-left corner or by pressing the R key. You can quit the game at any time by pressing Escape.\n\n![Screenshot 2.png](///raw/3b5/b/z/7d77.png)\n\n--- Music ---\n\nThere's no music! There was no time for it at all, I'm afraid. I suggest finding a good 8-bit/chiptune track to listen to on YouTube whilst you play. A game that allows your own music? Surely it must have the best soundtrack!\n\n--- Sound Effects ---\n\nAll of the SFX used in Cell Out! were downloaded from opengameart.org. If you want to use them too, you can find them right here: https://opengameart.org/content/512-sound-effects-8-bit-style\n\n--- Android Version ---\n\nIf you'd like to play on your Android device, you can download the APK file!

In recharge mode, you slowly gain energy, however, you cannot attack and have a slow movement speed so try not to run out of energy in the middle of a fight!\n\n## CONTROLS:\n#### KEYBOARD CONTROLS:\n\nMoving - WASD\n\nAttack - Left Mouse\n\nRoll - Right mouse\n\nRecharge Mode - Spacebar\n\n#### XBOX CONTROLLER CONTROLS:\n\nMoving - Left Stick\n\nAttack - A\n\nRoll - B\n\nRecharge Mode - X\n\n###### You can change the colour scheme of the game whenever by simply pressing 'C' on a keyboard or Y on a controller.\n\n## Hats!\nThere are collectible hats in the game which can be purchased with in-game currency which you get from killing things.\n\n#### HATS AND THEIR ABILITIES:\n\nToque - Faster energy regeneration.\n\nBaseball Cap - No longer slowed in regeneration mode.\n\nCowboy Hat - Do more damage.\n\nWarrior Helmet - Take less damage.\n\nChrono Hat - Enemies move slower and you regenerate energy a bit faster.\n\n###### Unfortunately, I was not able to add microtransactions to buy hats... I know you all would have loved it and spent half your life savings only to lose them 3 seconds later ;)\n\n## Fast Mode!\n\nJust in case the game wasn't hard enough for you, you have the option to play the game at 2x the speed!\n\n## Quick GIF of Gameplay!\n\n![combat.gif](///raw/01c/1/z/7f0d.gif)\n\n## HINTS!\n\n-Run away from enemies while attacking them to avoid them hitting you.\n\n-Don't run straight into bullets, they hurt\n\n-When you get a message to kill the drone, kill the one with the antenna. That one will stop enemies from spawning and allow you to go through the tunnel\n\n### Changes/Bug Fixes\n-Fixed the message about changing the colour. (It didn't show up before)\n\n-Fixed bug where buying health from non-shop could heal over max amount.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//01c/1/z/7cdd.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/ravager-the-lone-swordsman","author":{"name":"Ethan Allwood","uid":7184,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//01c/1/z/2b56.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/ethan-allwood"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//01c/1/z/7f0b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//01c/1/z/7f0b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//01c/1/z/7f0d.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//01c/1/z/7f0d.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://allwoodgamedev.itch.io/ravager-ld39"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Escapade !","category":"jam","description":"![Screen3.png](///raw/8c/z/7d0f.png)\n\n### HTML5 : https://togimaro.itch.io/escapade\n\n---\n### Synopsis :\nDANNY was an adventurous man in a quest for wealth and recognition.

Thank you for entering.\n\n## Game Description\n\n**Power** is and always has been in fragile balance. Human nature makes us ambitious and greedy. Dive into a high-seas adventure as a ship’s captain that must solve the problem of an imminent mutiny. Discover the secrets your sailors keep, and attain all the information needed to uncover the mutineer.\n\nWith **Rats will kiss the gunner's daughter** we’ve wanted to take on the challenge of generating a game with content created in a simple and functional way. Firstly, we turned the theme around, taking “*you are running out of power*” to mean the social kind of power, and not the mechanical or physical interpretation of the phrase that the mind first goes to. Also we’ve created a game environment that puts a lot of focus on human behaviour.\n\nWe hope you fully enjoy the experience and above all, that you make the mutineer kiss the gunner's daughter!\n\n## Game Instructions\n\nClick teh skull to open the daily note and the parchment to see the instructions and your crew.\n\nThis game lasts 5 days. On the 6th day you will have to execute the **mutineer**. Every day you will ask each sailor on your ship a different question.\n\nYou’ll have three options:\n\n*Blue button*: Ask peacefully.\n\n*Red button*: Use violence to get the information. This action will cost you a coin (to hire a bully).\n\n*Yellow button*: Bribe the sailor to get the information. This action will cost you a coin.\n\nEach day have two coins to spend. You can't save up coins to use the next day\n\n### IMPORTANT NOTES:\n- We **strongly** advise you to write down the information you acquire. These sailors will say many things and it may be hard to remember all of it.\n\n- Every time you play the game, the sailors will have a different name and appearance (face, head and body). Don't be afraid to give it a second try!\n\n- Extra point question: where is this ship exactly from?\n\n\n### Updates:\n- We have removed the unfinished language option (it was available in the windowed mode because it wasn't set at 16:9). Problem solved.\n\n- The game icon wasn't set correctly. Problem solved.\n\n### [Download game here](https://mrhoduini.itch.io/rats-will-kiss-the-gunners-daughter)\n\n\n![5.png](///raw/0a7/8/z/7cb0.png)\n______________________________________________________\n![3.png](///raw/0a7/8/z/7cba.png)\n______________________________________________________\n![7.png](///raw/0a7/8/z/7cc2.png)\n______________________________________________________\n![Credits.png](///raw/0a7/8/z/86cd.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0a7/8/z/7de6.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/rats-will-kiss-the-gunners-daughter","author":{"name":"Mr.Houdini","uid":34720,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0a7/8/z/835c.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/mr-houdini"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0a7/8/z/7cb0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0a7/8/z/7cb0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0a7/8/z/7cba.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0a7/8/z/7cba.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0a7/8/z/7cc2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0a7/8/z/7cc2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0a7/8/z/86cd.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0a7/8/z/86cd.png"}],"links":[],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Watt Runner","category":"jam","description":"Its a simple plat-former that reminds me of a time when the amount of time I could play games was based on the batteries in my game-boy.

We didn't prioritize tasks properly and spent too much time trying to make the game look good before making a working game.

It was made in Java, using the LibGDX framework. The music was made using BoscaCeoil, and the art was made using Aseprite\n\nThe game is controlled by mouse. All controls have tooltips when you hover your cursor over them.\n\nI made the game following the same restrictions as the Compo, except for spending 24 hours extra on polishing the game. Hence why it is in the Jam-category. This is also my very first LD-entry where I also had time to make some music, so I'm also pretty happy about finally reaching that personal milestone.\n\n## Added experimental HTML version\nI have added an experimental HTML version. I have played through the entire game using that version, so it should be working, but it requires a relatively high resolution. If you experience any problems, please write a comment.

The twist is that you can choose to lose any of these powers at any moment in the game by removing parts of your clothing. By doing this you lose a power but this action may help you overcome some obstacles that would be impossible to overcome without losing that power. For example: you start the game with sunglasses that allow you to stay on bright areas indefinitely.

My plan was to add levels and things but all I ended up getting done was a cool little circuit builder/editor, check it out if you want.\n  \nThe game (editor) is pretty straight forward and most stuff is explained in an in game panel but ill explain it some here. By default you start in an editing mode where you can use the pencil and your given items to create a circuit. In a normal level you'd have an objective to complete and limited resources but for this I just gave you infinity. Once you've built what you want you can click start and the game will start running. It runs at 1 tick/second which is how fast your circuit will execute. With the wrench you can interact with certain objects such as the Diode, Light, and Switch. \n\nAt this point the game is just a little demo and doesn't completely follow the theme but have fun with it if you want :)\n\n![circuit1.png](///raw/7c5/z/7c37.png)![circuit 2.png](///raw/7c5/z/7c39.png)![circuit 3.png](///raw/7c5/z/7c9f.png)\n\nI haven't tested the mac or linux versions but right now they're just the same .jar files.

Find the flying ores, craft wires, discover the power crystals and connect them to the ship. Help Ted escaping that weird planet!!!\n\n**Read the How To play, the game is not very intuitive**\n\n## Controls:\n\n- WASD to move\n- E to interact\n- ScrollWhell for zoom\n\n## How to Play:\n\n- You start beside your ship in a hexagonal grid. When you move the grid will start to uncover.\n- Your first mission is to find a flying ore, you will notice them for the brown hex.\n\n**This is how the ores look like, go to them and pres E to mine them**\n![Ore.JPG](///raw/a70/8/z/851b.jpg)\n- After you get enough resources from ores, you can go back to the ship and craft wires. (4 Cooper + 1 Prismalite = 1 Wire, 4 Copper + 1 Zetthyst = 4 wires)\n\n**This is how your ship looks like, go to it and press E to craft wires**\n![Sjip.JPG](///raw/a70/8/z/851c.jpg)\n- Now that you are armed with wires, it's time to find a Power crystal, they are fairly rare, you will notice them for the yellow hex.\n- When you spot a crystal, several blue hex will appear showing you where you can place the wires.\n\n**This is how a crystal looks like, and the blue hex shows you were you can place wires. Place them with E**\n![Crystal.JPG](///raw/a70/8/z/851e.jpg)\n- Place wires until you get to your ship. Place them with E but think before you do it, if the path to the ship is too long, energy will be lost.\n\n**This is how your wire will look after you place them**\n![Wire.JPG](///raw/a70/8/z/851f.jpg)\n- You can also join a wire to a previous existing path.\n- Remember, power crystal doesn't hold unlimited power.\n- If you are capable of powering the ship before the guys that were following you arrive, you'll be free.\n\n## Tips and tricks:\n\n- Always keep moving, you need to find ores and power crystals quickly.\n- As soon as you are able to craft wires, head to the ship and do it.\n- Connect the new paths to already existing ones, saves wires and time.\n- Search in a radial pattern, if you go too far away from the ship you will lose time returning for cables.\n- **The game has a lot of random variables when creating the map.** It can be really easy or really hard. I didn't had much time to tune this. So if you lose and feel the game didn't give you enough resources, try again and hope the odds are better next time.\n\n## Soundtrack: \n\nThe game has 2 songs composed by me one for the menu screen and the main theme. The main theme has two versions, an acoustic that plays when the game starts and an electric version that starts when you get closer to winning.\n\n[YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhTxY1L-05nHTWcYxYygeO8QL2ErEJe-5)\n\n## Some words:\n\nIt's my first time in a game jam and I surprise myself with the result. It's far from perfect, but to think I could do it in 72 hours blows my mind. \nI design the game, wrote all the code and compose the music. The main character is also my design, but all other models are taken from free resource packs in the Unity Asset Store.\n\n## Thanks to:\n\n- My brother for supporting me in all my ambitious (unfinished) projects.\n- My girlfriend for just supporting me in life and loving me with all her heart.\n- My dad for recording the sax part in the \"Electric\" theme of the song and remind me that I was against a clock.\n- And my mom too...for being there.\n\nI await your comments.\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a70/8/z/7a4a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/ted-crashed","author":{"name":"Sebastian-M","uid":32890,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a70/8/z/84b5.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/sebastian-m"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a70/8/z/851b.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a70/8/z/851b.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a70/8/z/851c.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a70/8/z/851c.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a70/8/z/851e.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a70/8/z/851e.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a70/8/z/851f.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a70/8/z/851f.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/smartinez15/LudumDare39"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://s-martinez.itch.io/ted-crashed"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://s-martinez.itch.io/ted-crashed-webgl"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Blood Mechs: The Iron Eucharist","category":"jam","description":"The year is 2044 AD, and the artificial intelligence known as G.O.R.E is on the verge of destroying humanity!

You should probably play v1.0.3 if you are judging the game as it is the last version that is strictly and inarguably bugfixes.\n\nv1.0.5 | 2017-08-02 (but even later)\n- reduced the size of the lingering bolt's hitbox to prevent an exploit where players could block off the whole cave with one lingering bolt\n- fixed flickering text at the beginning of cutscenes\n\nv1.0.4 | 2017-08-02 (but later)\n- souls no longer run away from you as much\n- cutscenes now progress only when you hit the \"Progress\" button instead of any button. By default, the \"Progress\" button is left click.\n- lingering bolts now cost 100 energy, and sweeping bolts now cost 70 energy. This sould make the \"constant walls of lingering bolts\" strategy nonviable, and encourage more frequent use of sweeping bolts (which are awesome).\n- reordered UI buttons and control scheme accordingly\n- added some text to the gameplay UI that displays the current level\n- added instructions right at the beginning of the game\n- the next level will no longer start if you are in the middle of summoning a soul\n- fixed tiny annoying green border around cutscene, game over, and credits screens\n- made another attempt at fixing the \"lightning is summoned when sould summoning ray is summoned\" bug.

This isn't very clear and feels pretty empty, but it was a time issue, not a design choice.\n - Leaving your ship forces it to slow down quite rapidly, so don't be afraid to jump off the helm for an easy parking job.\n - If you can't seem to avoid falling off the islands, try leaving your Telepod on your ship before you hop off to mine.  Then just port back on when you're done.\n - Pay attention to your Reactor Gauge.  If you get stranded with no power you might have to jump off the ledge and start over.\n - Flying is a tricky feature, not an icky bug.\n - The stairs don't have collisions on the bottom few rungs. Get a run at them and jump on if you're having trouble.  You can't jump straight up through them.\n \n###### Thanks for your patience!  Hope you enjoy your time in the game!

Although it is still incomplete, we're very proud of what we've accomplished and hope that you enjoy roaming our small, buggy and randomly generated levels.\nNovember Hail is a game about a guy who helps restore a town's energy by killing scary, robot crabs. You can sell the scraps of these crabs for more energy. This can be put to waste by killing more crabs with your energy consuming laser gun. If you ever happen to fully run out of energy, you can borrow a loan from the banker, but you will need to pay it back or you'll be sitting around for a very, VERY long time.\nAnyway, we hope you enjoy the game as much as we enjoyed making it. Next time I'll definitely try to better my workflow to get more basic tasks done sooner, as the first few days were not too productive.

There's unfortunately no UI to indicate progress, so it'll just show a black screen after the initial download progress bar completes.\n\nWhile I definitely recommend trying out the webcam-based version, quite understandably most people either don't have a webcam or would feel uncomfortable, hence the creation of the stand-alone version.

You had finite bullets and shooting would reduce your damage output each time. If you wasted them on trash mobs, the boss would be (nearly) impossible. After we added some graphical effects, shooting became way too fun so we scrapped the original idea and tried a few other things. We ultimately decided to shy away from the theme in favour of making the game as fun as possible.\n\nAs is tradition, we went into Ludum Dare with a lot of ambition and ended up having to cut a lot of content. We originally had four stages planned but due to time restraints we cut it down to a single stage that has a mini boss, instead of full stages with full bosses.\n\nAll-in-all, we're fairly proud of this game despite the severe lack of polish and plan to clean up the code, polish the engine, and try to make a more full game.

You were programmed to run, and to collect items. So... run as far as you can! Collect as many items as you can too! See how far you can go before your battery runs out. Can you get a score of 10000? For fun, feel free to post your highest score in the comments below!\n\nThis is my first-ever Ludum Dare entry. Developing a game in such a short time frame is a new experience to me! I had fun, and I'm glad to have something I can share with you!\n\n![RunnerbotLudumScreenshot.png](///raw/285/9/z/78ce.png)\n\n\n## HOW TO PLAY\n\nYou need a keyboard to play:\n\n- WASD-keys - move up, lef, down, right (respectively)\n\n- Space-bar - Pause or continue.\n\n- Q-key - use a shield item\n\n- E-key - use a pulse remote item\n\nThe main 'winning' goal for this version is to get a score of 10000. You increase your score by running toward the right side of the screen, and by picking up items. There are a few other small bonuses here and there too that you'll find (hint: try to get enemy bots stunned!).\n\nOnce you achieve a score of 10000, the game does not automatically end. Content is procedurally-generated, so you can theoretically keep playing indefinitely (maybe you want to go for 20000? Or 30000? :-P ). The game *will* automatically end when your power (shown by the battery in the lower left of the screen) runs out and when you have no more extra lives.\n\nOne more useful hint: when you pause, you'll see a cheat-sheet showing all the different items, tiles, and robots that you can encounter. Feel free to pause to consult this anytime. :-)\n\n![PauseScreen.png](///raw/285/9/z/861f.png)\n\n\n## DOWNLOAD LINKS:\n\nWebGL (no download required!): https://pixelgamewizard.itch.io/runnerbot\n\nWindows: https://www.dropbox.com/s/nbjd0q3u3npcsjb/Runnerbot_v_1_0_Windows.zip?dl=1\n\nMac*: https://www.dropbox.com/s/p5m8kjhbigzq4r1/Runnerbot_v_1_0_MacOSX.zip?dl=1 \n\nLinux: https://www.dropbox.com/s/z899kw5r2utqalj/Runnerbot_v_1_0_Linux.zip?dl=1\n\n(* I have very little experience with Mac. Please let me know if this doesn't work.)\n\n\n## FEEDBACK:\n\nThis is my first Ludum Dare (and also the first game I've ever published!)... so I really do appreciate feedback. If you're otherwise having trouble coming up with feedback for me, I'd really like to know:\n\n- How would you suggest I balance difficulty in a game like this? What kind of specific feedback would you ask from playtesters?\n\n- How did you personally find the game difficulty/balance?\n\n\n## KNOWN ISSUES:\n\nAlthough I spent as much time as I could in these 72 hours finding and squashing bugs, I'm sure I missed a few. If you find some, please let me know!\n\n- The procedural generation is somewhat... crude. Although I implemented safeguards to make sure the game is playable, I have seen on **very** rare occasion a complete wall generate from the very top of the screen to bottom, blocking your way. If this happens to you, I'd love to see a screenshot so I can try to debug it.\n\n- No audio.\n\n- The high score only works for your instance of the game. If you close the game, and open it later... It'll reset to the default of 10000.\n\n\n## EXTRA FEATURE:\n\nIf you want to try something different... then turn on \"Constant Running Mode\" by pressing the P key while in-game. In this mode, you cannot stop - if you hit a wall or other obstacle, Runnerbot will simply choose a new direction to go in. If you don't like it, you can turn it off by pressing the P key a second time. :-)\n\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:\n\nTools:\n\n- Unity3D Engine: Game engine.\n\n- Visual Studio Code: Coding! Yay! This works in Linux too!\n\n- GIMP: For making graphics\n\n- Blender: For making models\n\nCommercial-use-friendly fonts from the following links:\n\n- http://www.fontspace.com/cedders/segment7\n\n- http://www.fontspace.com/coding4web-com/digital\n\n- http://www.fontspace.com/lcd-solid/lcd-solid\n\n## CHANGELOG\n\nV.1.0a - Removed some personal meta information from the build settings. Changed a few things around supported resolutions. Also a later edit to this post to clarify the rules a bit more (sleep-deprived me so not-good at write-good).\n\nV.1.0b - Added black quads to the outside of the screen area (full-screen web player apparently ignores the list of supported resolutions, so this was necessary to avoid strange rendering artefacts in full-screen). Updated the pause screen to show the correct textures for \"wall\" and \"conveyor\" tiles.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//285/9/z/7810.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/runnerbot-ld39entry","author":{"name":"Pixel Game Wizard","uid":38274,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//285/9/z/7e8a.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/pixel-game-wizard"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//285/9/z/78ce.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//285/9/z/78ce.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//285/9/z/861f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//285/9/z/861f.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/nbjd0q3u3npcsjb/Runnerbot_v_1_0_Windows.zip?dl=1"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/p5m8kjhbigzq4r1/Runnerbot_v_1_0_MacOSX.zip?dl=1"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/z899kw5r2utqalj/Runnerbot_v_1_0_Linux.zip?dl=1"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://itch.io/embed-upload/555550?color=111111"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Hamster Defense","category":"jam","description":"buttons: Z, X, arrow\n\npress Z to get in the wheel or the cannon, and X to leave\n\nwhile running in the wheel, smash the arrows and Z button as fast as you can to get it spinning\nspinning the wheel will get you energy to shoot with the cannon\nsurvive for about 4 minutes to win","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//415/b/z/79b5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/hamster-defense","author":{"name":"Gudtavosky","uid":46356,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/gudtavosky"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://gudtavosky.itch.io/hamster"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Little Robot","category":"jam","description":"We only had one day.\n\n![ludum39.PNG](///raw/714/b/z/754c.png)\n\nDOWNLOAD: https://klino123.itch.io/little-robot","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//714/b/z/78c8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/little-robot","author":{"name":"klino123","uid":46103,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/klino123"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//714/b/z/754c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//714/b/z/754c.png"}],"links":[],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Pulse","category":"jam","description":"This is a game where you must survive against enemies as long as you can, while keeping the lights on so you can see.

Naïve vambot hunter expects our hero's batteries to run dry real soon, but he underestimates DraBot's energy sucking abilities. Shall we see who ends up out of juice first?\n\nSecond level is still in development (no boss, so not included), third level is in \"beta\" (as in it's less tested but completely playable all the way through).\n\n### Controls:  \n\n* Arrows - Movement  \n* Space/Up arrow - Jump  \n* Q/W/E/A/S/D/Z/X/C - Attack everyone around yourself and heal off the damage inflicted  \n* Enter - Selection in menus  \n* Escape - In-game pause  \n\n### Credits:\n\n* Art - Tay Elenberg (@tay-elenberg)  \n* Programming - Gil4 (@gil4)\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nAs a lot of the comments say, the controls are hard to get used to, but I'd like to mention that's intentional and not just an oversight. I'm a hardcore platformer player myself and having slower, punishable moves is something I've come to like after years of genre experience. Consider it a challenge. :)\n\nNot trying to make an excuse of \"everything is intentional, guys\" though, obviously the game does need some balance tweaking (combining game designer and programmer roles is hard and leads to the quality vs. quantity of content choices, so had to make tons of compromises). Plus quite a lot of planned stuff (like additional skills and enemies that'd make the game *a lot* more dynamic and enjoyable) was left out since, well, it's a jam, you know the drill. That said, we like the end product considering the time restrictions and find it fun to play ourselves as it is. \n\nHope you like it too!\n\n### Hotfix 01.08.2017:\n\n1. HP of the first Boss fixed - during some last hour testing made it smaller for faster walkthroughs and forgot to reverse the change, haha.\n2. Attack of the final Boss bug fixed.

As a result the endings are a bit bugged since i had to start uploading 2 hours early due to my slow upload speed and still just made it barely in time at the end of the submission hour. I hope that's not too much of deal^^.\nIf you like our game you should check out the post-jam version as well since it fixes the problems regarding the different endings. But of course please judge the game on the jam version!\n\nAnyway, we hope you like our game and we are exited to play all your games as well! Have fun!\n\n\n**Game Description:**\n\nThe end has come! Fossil resources have been depleted and a devastating war has put the world into nuclear winter. There is just one last power source left: Fluffy the Hamster!\n\nLook out for humanity's last hope by feeding him carrots and allowing him some much needed rest every now and then. Meanwhile you have to distribute the limited energy he can produce between incoming emergency requests.\n\nOn top of that you should try to generate and put aside as much money as possible to purchase valuable upgrades for Fluffy.

You'll not find any help nor tips in game, but this is very simple : your goal is to steal power on the upper-right corner of the level, and to get back to the lower-left corner (where you started) to take it. Each power charge is counted on the bottom, and there is no limit nor win condition. You have to avoid the robot-guards, if they see you they pursue you, and if they catch you, you're dead (surprised?) Click on a floor tile to move, but be careful : the automatic path do not avoid guards…  \n  \nSome useful informations :  \n  \n • guards can't see through concrete walls, but they can see through glass (and bluish grey thin walls *are* made of glass)  \n • guards vision is 6 tiles long  \n • when they stay somewhere, guards can see 360°  \n • while moving, guards have a 120° wide vision, centered on the direction they go  \n • while in alert mode, if they don't see you for 20 seconds, they go back to their nearest patrol point  \n • alert a guard is a good way to extract it from his patrol path ;) (but it will be faster and will activly search you for a while, so act carefuly with that in mind)  \n • each stolen power charge adds 0.1 tile/second to the guards patrol speed (wich is 1 tile/second at start)  \n \n  \n  \n*Edit : There was a bug with the way the guards detects player presence, it's fixed now. To catch it, I had to add a debug mode, wich is showing basic detections points while moving - so, if you want to have a visible clue of the guards's sight, hit F6 ;)  \n(but, please, keep in mind that this \"function\" was not existing in published version, so don't take that in count for judging)*","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b3/z/83b3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/tax-rebel","author":{"name":"LeReveur","uid":59,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b3/z/3d10.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/lereveur"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b3/z/7ee7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b3/z/7ee7.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b3/z/83b3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b3/z/83b3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://workshop.xenedon.com/LD39/index.html"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"The Torches Are Burning Low","category":"jam","description":"I have spent so much time with my students doing classic 2D maze puzzle games, I thought I would try the same concept with a retro Wolfenstein 3D look.

You play as a Wisp, an ancient creature made entirely out of light. Your objective is simple ... stay alive as long as you can until your power runs out. Try it out and see how long will your light last!\n\n## Basic Rules:\n\nUse W A S D keys to move around.\n\nYour life bar is the light around you. When you move, shoot (left mouse button), swing(right mouse button), or use an item ( keys #1 and #2) you lose your light(life). You can hold the right mouse button to keep swinging.\n\nYour main source of power is harvested through glowing rocks scattered around the map. To harvest their energy simply get close to them. If you do not consume the full energy from a glowing rock , they will regenerate and go back to normal. It is also important to note that glowing rocks when fully charged can sometimes spread to other rocks around them.\n\nAnother good source of energy is the ones gathered from light particles. Light Particles are droped by every enemy when when they are killed. Those light particles can be harvested by the player if he comes near them but they also dissipate over time so be quick!\n\nThere are 2 craftable items: \n\n-> **Beacon** : Atracts shadows / enemies\n\n-> **Barrier**: They are obstacles that prevent enemies from atacking the player by blocking their path (ranged enemies cant shoot through barriers. Even though barriers prevent enemies from atacking ... they allow the player to shoot through.\n\nBoth items have a time limit and are upgradable. You gain XP (experience points) when you kill shadows and once you reach a certain ammount of XP you gain a new level and the item's button will change to green. At that time you have to chose what item you want to upgrade (both are upgradable 3 times).\n\n**Upgrades:**\n\n->Beacon Level 1 -> Duration == **5 Seconds**\n\n->Beacon Level 2 -> Duration == **7 Seconds**\n\n->Beacon Level 3 -> Duration == **10 Seconds**\n\n\n->Barrier Level 1 -> Duration == **5 Seconds**\n\n->Barrier Level 2 -> Duration == **7 Seconds**\n\n->Barrier Level 3 -> Duration == **10 Seconds**\n \n\n## Tools:\n\n->> Unity,\n\n->> Audacity,\n\n->> Blender,\n\n->> paint.NET\n\n->> Inkscape\n\n## Screenshoots:\n\n![mainMenu.png](///raw/da3/z/81d4.png)\n\n![Screenshoot1.png](///raw/da3/z/81d5.png)\n\n![screenshoot3.png](///raw/da3/z/7e5e.png)\n\n![screenshoot4.png](///raw/da3/z/7e5f.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//da3/z/7d79.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/super-game-2-revenge-of-stuff","author":{"name":"Mordokay","uid":941,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/mordokay"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//da3/z/81d4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//da3/z/81d4.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//da3/z/81d5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//da3/z/81d5.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//da3/z/7e5e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//da3/z/7e5e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//da3/z/7e5f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//da3/z/7e5f.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BySSQIC6vuWIOWRzeFU1cTB1ekk"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BySSQIC6vuWIZGpLdkp6ZmNnMW8"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BySSQIC6vuWISnpvbS1qT2w4QUE"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Dont ask me to stop being a outdated junkrobot","category":"jam","description":"![ludum.jpg](///raw/ef5/9/z/7c46.jpg)\n\nSaigo is running out of power and needs to kill other robots to energize himself.\n\nWASD move,\n\nLeft button mouse attack.\n\nRight button mouse dash.\n\nSPECIAL:     hold shift + left mouse button; (requires 1 bar)\n\nULTIMATE:    hold shift + right mouse button;  (requires 3 bars)\n\nCredits\n\nMusic : Cybass\n\nBackgrounds : Rubembborges\n\nCharacters: Arturwine\n\nGame Design, Programming : Lui Gama\n\nMoral Support: Joel Hamon\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ef5/9/z/7b03.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/dont-ask-me-to-stop-being-a-outdated-junkrobot","author":{"name":"Ludic Studios","uid":38398,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/ludic-studios"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ef5/9/z/7c46.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ef5/9/z/7c46.jpg"}],"links":[],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"BUG SQUASHER 9000","category":"jam","description":"The mainframe has become infested with bugs.

When green progress bar fills up, your game is done and you're going to be presented with scores.\n\n**Controls**\n\n**Mouse** - Clicky click\n\n**Escape** - Close Shop window\n\n**Fun Fact**\n\nThe power in hotel I'm staying at actually went out in process of making this game, such an irony huh?","thumbnail_url":"","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/ludum-dare-simulator-click-and-make-your-own-game-inside-a-game","author":{"name":"VitoGaming","uid":8133,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/vitogaming"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://nufflee.itch.io/ludum-dare-simulator"},{"label":"macOS","url":""},{"label":"Linux","url":""},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://nufflee.itch.io/ludum-dare-simulator"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"They Came from Planet ZhorPak","category":"jam","description":"![ScreenShotGame.PNG](///raw/590/9/z/7b6e.png)This is my Little 2D Space Shooter.\n\nControls:\n- Move: WSAD or Arrow Keys,\n- Shoot: Spacebar\n------------------------------\n\nThis was my first Ludum Dare, the game is rough around the edges...and maybe a littlebit incomplete.\nBut nonetheless, it was a fun Weekend for me.\n\nI hope you'll enjoy my Game :) ","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//590/9/z/77b9.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/they-came-from-planet-zhorpak","author":{"name":"Tunahead","uid":37013,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/tunahead"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//590/9/z/7b6e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//590/9/z/7b6e.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0By5M7KwMsnslWlZmOUFzX2pBSFU"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Potential Energy","category":"jam","description":"My second Ludum Dare game!

During warp, you lost power, and have been drifting since. A small team of scavengers has reawakened you by accident while salvaging supplies from your vessel. Perhaps your circuits aren't working quite as well as they used to, but you must use the remaining power at your disposal to steal their power supply and continue the journey back to fleet command.\n\nFeatures:\n-Hijack people with your nanomachines for as long as you can to bring the scavenger's battery back to the core.\n![Begin.gif](///raw/404/9/z/7b0c.gif)\n![Claw.gif](///raw/404/9/z/7bac.gif)\n-Use the ships systems to your advantage with the power you have left.

Or, just shoot them using your hijacked body.\n![DropBox.gif](///raw/404/9/z/7b93.gif)\n\n\n\nI had a lot of fun working on this with a friend of mine, unfortunately we only got what was supposed to be the first level of many done. \nMissing more levels and more extravagant ways to slaughter people with the ship's system, but that's what always happens with these jams.\n\n**Controls:**\nLeft Mouse Button: Activates systems by clicking.\nLeft Drag: Moves the camera\nW,D: Move left and right\nS: Play Dead\nQ: Shoot (If you have a gun)\nE: Pickup or Drop Battery (It's on the side of the shuttle craft in the bay)\nR: Hijack (They need to be in front of your character)\nShift: Sprint (Doubles your hijacked energy consumption rate)\n\n**Need Help?**\nQ: All I see is a room with a green guy walking around\nA: At the beginning you are only the AI. If the objective doesn't seem clear, simply wait for the green guy to walk in front of the red eyeball and hit the hijack key 'r', it will take him over and you can work your way from there!\n\nQ: Where's the warp core?\nA: It's the big star trek looking blue thing. Bring the power core/battery to the warp core and you'll get to see your ship warp away! If not, look at your objective at the bottom.\n\nQ: Is there only one level?\nA: Yes, didn't have time to add more. Sorry about that, if enough people are interested I might work on adding more the game. Let me know @Futilrevenge on twitter!\n\nQ: The enemies slid around really fast for a second, why?\nA: A bug I haven't smashed yet, though if I release another version I certainly will\n\nQ: What are the bars on the bottom left?\nA: The white one is your hijacked person's health bar. It will drain over time, so be sure to keep hijacking people!\nThe green one is your ships power. Using systems will use power, though you can get some back by disabling certain systems such as by opening doors. If you run out you can't use the elevators, so be careful!\n\n**If you have any other questions just tweet at me and I'll get back to you ASAP!

The game was tested on Windows and Linux.*\n\n### Description\nWe are in a future world where many robots roam the streets. Due to the invention of new energy sources, all coal power plants were shut down. But there were tiny (but more than relevant) faults in the new power plants. Now the energy of the world is running low. The first action, the government announced, was to shut down every electronic robot until a solution will be found. The robots which developed an self-learning AI over the years, of course hate the idea of being shut down, so they turned off their wireless control units and resist the government. They became hostile to every human nearing them.\n\nNow, you appear on the plan. You are an old coal-driven robot and thus are no danger to the critical power situation of the world. Your job now, is to shut down every electronic robot you can find.\n\n![Day Three 2017-08-01T02-57.png](///raw/c31/z/77c3.png)\n\n### Gameplay\nIn this game you have to shut down every robot to save the world. You have to sneak past those robots and try not to be discovered.\n\nYou can move by rightclicking on tiles. You interact with objects in the same way. The camera is moveable with WSAD.  Press R to restart a level and ESC to exit to the main menu.\n\nIf you have problems with a level, you can skip it by using the level selection in the main menu.\n\n\n### Technical Details\nThe game was made in Java using libGDX (http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). I made all the graphics myself with the tool MagicaVoxel (https://ephtracy.github.io/). The background music was made using LMMS (https://lmms.io/). All the sound effects were created with assets of the 'The #GameAudioGDC Bundle' (Part 3) (http://www.sonniss.com/gameaudiogdc2017/).\n\n\n### Made by\nSkosnowich  \n\n# Complete Playthrough\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9R1EG2zy-A\n\n# Links (Download)\n[itch.io - Version 1.0.0](https://skosnowich.itch.io/shut-everything-down)\n\n[Dropbox - Version 1.0.0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3if70wydy9zlpz6/Shut%20Everything%20Down-1.0.0.jar?dl=0)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c31/z/757e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/shut-everything-down","author":{"name":"Skosnowich","uid":316,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c31/z/2b59.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/skosnowich"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c31/z/7585.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c31/z/7585.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c31/z/77c3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c31/z/77c3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/3if70wydy9zlpz6/Shut%20Everything%20Down-1.0.0.jar?dl=0"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/3if70wydy9zlpz6/Shut%20Everything%20Down-1.0.0.jar?dl=0"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/3if70wydy9zlpz6/Shut%20Everything%20Down-1.0.0.jar?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Sunseeker","category":"jam","description":"![battlefield.png](///raw/125/7/z/76f9.png)\n\nIn his journey to the festival, the King is ambushed by the filthy orcs.

You may only power a tile that is next to an already powered tile. A powered tile has a blue circuit underneath and usually a visible power line as well. When you have provided power to the exit node you may click the exit node to exit the level when you are ready. Starting a new level will restore a small amount of power to your pool - the only other way to increase it is to connect the power line to Power Pylons on the grid.\n\nThe contents of each level grid is generated by the game at the start of each level. The game has a difficulty curve which affects the spawn rate of certain items and how much a move costs or restores. Expect to hit more serious difficulty after level 10.\n\nCollecting points is the only way to increase your score but can be expensive in power. Try to spot a route that would take you through additional pylons. Also consider powering the exit node FIRST so if you run out of power trying to pick up other items you know you are still able to exit the level. In later levels you will want a good reserve of power to take into the next level to cope with the increased cost of building - you'll have to consider how much you want those points, really..\n\n\"Locked\" points require powering a key node before you can collect them - this can be even more expensive but they are worth a lot of points for your effort.\n\nCorruption (purple tiles) spreads as \"real time\" that passes. In early levels the additional cost to move through corruption is a mild nuisance but the further you get in the more prohibitively expensive it is to move through corruption. Corruption can not spread to powered tiles so sometimes its wise to try and cage it in. If you see corruption on the level when it starts it's certainly time to act fast and try and get that exit node powered before the corruption spreads.\n\nSome times you will be able to see that there is no way for you to complete a level with the power you have. You may press the button in the top right to restart a level with new content but it costs power to activate. It's a bit of a gamble for whether you will get a better grid next time. If you do not have enough power to restart the level then the button abandons the current play through and you will have to start again! \n\nHere is a link to a build that didn't quite make it to the 9pm deadline. It was completed and tested shortly thereafter and includes some nice level transition effects and GPU melting particles.\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0_hNHD_Nn5pX1FfNmNCM1Z5elk","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//6a4/9/z/77bb.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/zzap","author":{"name":"HS_Dave","uid":38054,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/hs-dave"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//6a4/9/z/80f6.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//6a4/9/z/80f6.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.heavenlysoftware.co.uk/LD39/ZZAP.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"The Last Knight","category":"jam","description":"You're a small knight in an ethereal world.

Players battle it out as 2 RC Bots, running on unfortunately tiny batteries. To win Botken, you must push your opponent off the edge of the arena and get them plugged. No HP, no timers: Botken is about dominating the arena, managing your power and showing the world what a tin-can can do!\n\n\n![72af.gif](///raw/350/5/z/777f.gif)\n\n\n## How To Play\nThe Bots always move forward automatically, and each has 4 inputs (Player 1 on the left uses WASD, and Player 2 on the right uses the Arrow Keys):\n\n- W / Up - for a High Attack\n- S / Down - for a Low Attack\n- D / Left - for a Dash Attack\n- A / Right - for a Backdash\n\nWatch your opponent and react with the right move to inch them closer to the plug, or go full aggro and smash them into it.\n#### Gameplay Subtleties\n##### Bot Power Knockback\nThe power you have in store determines how far you are going to fly off when hit by an attack. The less power in store, the further the distance you’re knocked back!\nNote that performing attacks costs a bit of energy, but getting hit costs more.\n\nWhen running completely out of energy, the Bot enters recovery mode, regenerating its power over the course of a few seconds. It cannot act while doing so; it is our version of a “Stun”. Pro-tip: Hitting an opponent in recovery mode will stop the recovery at the amount it is at the moment they get hit.\n##### Combo Counter\nThe higher the current combo, the more Power is drained when landing a hit on the opponent.\n\nThe combo counter increases for every hit a player lands without getting hit in return, and drops to 0 whenever the other player starts his own combo streak.\n\nHit fast, hit hard, hit often!\n\n\n\n#### Stable mode: https://hu9o.itch.io/botken\n#### Experimental online mode: http://vps417653.ovh.net:3333/\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//350/5/z/75ce.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/botken-assault-and-battery","author":{"name":"Toone","uid":20563,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/toone"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//350/5/z/787f.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//350/5/z/787f.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//350/5/z/777f.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//350/5/z/777f.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://hu9o.itch.io/botken"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Nex Machinan","category":"jam","description":"**Nex Machinan** is an arcade game, with **global leaderboards** and **progressive difficulty/speed**. \n\nSurvive by shooting **hordes of enemies** and keeping your energy meter alive... **If you can**.\n\n![titulo.png](///raw/cef/1/z/7f8f.png)\n\nBeat the record, have fun and feel free to give feedback, suggest postjam features and ask for **reviews in your games** as well. \n\n**Thanks for playing**.\n\n![ingame1.png](///raw/cef/1/z/7f90.png)\n\n**Credits**: Just me this time, except for music, sounds and fonts (full credits coming soon).\n\n**For the players with performance issues**, I have put some debug keys: \n> ALPHA1, ALPHA2, ALPHA3 and ALPHA4 disable Antialiasing, Bloom, Contrast Stretch, and Vignetting and Chromatic Aberration.\n>\n> ALPHA5 toggles the FPS meter.\n\n\n.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cef/1/z/8637.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/nex-machinan","author":{"name":"MestreRothLD","uid":8172,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/mestrerothld"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cef/1/z/7f8f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cef/1/z/7f8f.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cef/1/z/7f90.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cef/1/z/7f90.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/q1z4bo4kgpofc9v/LD39%20NexMachenan%200.94.zip?dl=1"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"ESCAPE DRIVE","category":"jam","description":"![1.png](///raw/cb7/3/z/766b.png)\n\nEscape the law in this vehicular endless runner!\n\nItch page: https://nykolar.itch.io/escape-drive\n\n![2.png](///raw/cb7/3/z/779d.png)\n\n![5.png](///raw/cb7/3/z/779e.png)\n\n![4.png](///raw/cb7/3/z/77a0.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cb7/3/z/756a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/escape-drive","author":{"name":"NykolaR","uid":14268,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/nykolar"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cb7/3/z/766b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cb7/3/z/766b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cb7/3/z/779d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cb7/3/z/779d.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cb7/3/z/779e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cb7/3/z/779e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cb7/3/z/77a0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cb7/3/z/77a0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":""}],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Spacious Righteous Starship","category":"jam","description":"Try to escape from a huge wave of dark matter and exploding supernovas!

We were aiming for a Megaman-like difficulty level. Due to lack of playtesting we overshot a little bit.\n\nCONTROLS:\n\nYou can use WASD or arrow key to run.\nJump with SPACE.\nJetpack hover with Mousebutton or CTRL.\nUsing Jetpack and then Jump results in a boostet jump.\nYou can also use a gamepad. \n\n\n\nHOW IT WENT:\n\nSo our team of 5 took off to design a “jump and run”-game. Because last time we did a tower defence which lacked story to 100%, we aimed to make our game more complete. So we planed a small story, an intro and outro scene, a tutorial stage, a player hub and several levels. We achieved most of it except for additional levels so we are quite happy with the result. All of us being hobbyists level design and balancing took to long. Costing almost all sleep in the progress (most of us slept less than 10 hours in these 3 days). 8 Minutes before end of the competition we finished postprocessing and uploaded the whole thing. But more on that in our postmortem post. We would love anyone to try our game and comment what they thought of it.\n\n\n\n![dono1a.png](///raw/dd5/2/z/86f1.png)\n\n![coverImage.png](///raw/dd5/2/z/7750.png)\n\n![dono2.png](///raw/dd5/2/z/86f3.png)\n\n![dono3.png](///raw/dd5/2/z/86f4.png)\n\n![dono4.png](///raw/dd5/2/z/86f5.png)\n\n![dono5.png](///raw/dd5/2/z/86f6.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//dd5/2/z/7716.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/disaster-on-nebula-one","author":{"name":"RAC-Games","uid":9693,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/rac-games"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//dd5/2/z/86f1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//dd5/2/z/86f1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//dd5/2/z/7750.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//dd5/2/z/7750.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//dd5/2/z/86f3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//dd5/2/z/86f3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//dd5/2/z/86f4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//dd5/2/z/86f4.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//dd5/2/z/86f5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//dd5/2/z/86f5.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//dd5/2/z/86f6.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//dd5/2/z/86f6.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://rac-games.itch.io/dono"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Gravity Assist","category":"jam","description":"**Gravity Assist takes a real world trick for dealing with little available power and makes a game out of it.**\n\n![Gravity Assist Use Gravity to your advantage](///content/013/b/z/7503.png)\n\nThereby, I mean so called *\"Gravity Assists\"* (or *Slingshots*), which are manouvers in space travel, where fuel is very limited and the gravity of different planets/moons/etc. can or must be used to get to the desired destination.\n\n![LD39-1.png](///raw/013/b/z/7556.png)\n\nAs this is my first attempt on a Ludum Dare Game (i.e. my first Game Jam at all), my time planning wasn't too good and I now think I should have prioritized things a bit differently, but now it is how it is – so:\n\n**:video_game: Just play.

That's also why I didn't opt out any voting category except humor (as my game has no story).\n- When downloading one of the standalone versions (Mac, Win, Linux), you can even kind of mod the game, as the levels are defined in the *levels.json* file in the *Unity Streaming Assets Folder*.\n\n### Known issues\n\n- Sometimes, the \"power indicator bar\" in the bottom left-hand corner isn't correct when starting the game, it gets corrected after the first shot, though\n- Bloom (The \"shining\") makes it hard to read the UI on some screens\n- It is very short (just three levels) – in the Windows, macOS & Linux versions, you can add your own levels by editing the *levels.json* file, though\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//013/b/z/7503.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/gravity-assist","author":{"name":"pklaschka","uid":45840,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/pklaschka"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//013/b/z/7503.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//013/b/z/7503.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//013/b/z/7556.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//013/b/z/7556.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://ld39.pabloklaschka.de"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://ld39.pabloklaschka.de/Windows.zip"},{"label":"macOS","url":"http://ld39.pabloklaschka.de/GravityAssist.dmg"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://ld39.pabloklaschka.de/Linux.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Space email 4000","category":"jam","description":"![gameplay2_small.png](///raw/e85/2/z/7756.png)\n\n\n![ui_small.png](///raw/e85/2/z/774c.png)\n\n### Description\n\nCustomize power crystals in a large variety of combinations to meet the demands of the ship, run by your \"professional\" colleagues.

I also did realise some other enemies, but only the drones made it out in the final version. \nMaybe if I gather time I will also implement all the other stuff. \n\nI sleept 14h in 3 days and worked 39h, but nothing stopped me from using every single moment free for this Ludum Dare entry! :D\n\nI hope you'll enjoy my game! \n\nThanks. \n\n![exo 2.PNG](///raw/1d7/1/z/81d0.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1d7/1/z/7a9d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/exo-stranded","author":{"name":"nikteddy92","uid":6097,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/nikteddy92"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1d7/1/z/81ce.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//1d7/1/z/81ce.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1d7/1/z/81d0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//1d7/1/z/81d0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://bit.ly/EXO-STRANDED"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://bit.ly/EXO-STRANDED"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Blackout: Security Breach","category":"jam","description":"In the depths of a facility designed to house the most dangerous, most mysterious evils, a fuse burns out.

If they're all empty at the end of a turn you'll lose.\n\nYour powers will spend different amounts of energy, the circled number in the upper right corner.\n\nThe damage a power deals is displayed in the lower left corner.\n\nIf you ever start a turn without being able to use any of your powers you lose.\n\nEach point of enemy damage will drain energy from a pool at random.\n\nThere are three types of powers:\nAttack powers deal damage, they're represented by a sword in the upper left corner.\n\nDefence powers reduce damage taken, they're represented by a shield in the upper left corner.\n\nSupport powers regenerate energy, they're represented by a circled plus in the upper left corner.\n\nThe enemy will give you a generic tell. It's an indication of what it might do.\n\nYou pick an power to use against it.\n\nFire counters Water.\nWater counters Fire.\nAir counters Air.\nEarth counters Earth.\n\nFire is resitant to Fire.\nWater is resistant to Water.\nAir is resistant to Earth.\nEarth is resistant to Air.\n\nDefence counters Attack, it will half the damage taken and cancel any extra ability the Attack power might provide. If it belongs to the counter element it will nullify the damage completely. If a Defence power doesn't face an Attack any special abilities it might provide do not trigger.\n\nResistance halves damage as well(e.g.: Using a Fire Attack on a Fire elemental will cause it to only take half damage). If it also happened to defend it will nullify the entire damage.\n\nHalved values are rounded up.\n\nAttack counters Support if it is of the counter element(e.g. a Water Attack will prevent a Fire Support from doing anything, an Air Attack will prevent an Air Support from doing anything).\n\nAfter you defeat an enemy you will receive energy depending on its level.\n\nYou also get your choice of one of three powers. The powers are tied to the element of the defeated enemy(e.g.: A Fire enemy will most likely offer Fire powers and energy, it might offer some Earth and/or Air powers and energy, but it will never generate any Water powers or energy).\n\nYou can choose to skip any of three powers and get more energy.\n\nThere are four waves of lesser elementals followed by four waves of greater elementals. If you defeat all eight you win the game.\nIf you ever run out of energy or start a turn without any usable powers you lose.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//bd1/z/7742.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/elemental-conflict","author":{"name":"dankar","uid":475,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/dankar"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//bd1/z/7931.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//bd1/z/7931.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://itch.io/embed-upload/553309?color=000000"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Deus Lightning Force","category":"jam","description":"Mengane present his new game on the occasion of the 39th edition of the Ludum Dare competition on the theme \"Running Out Of Power\": Deus Lightning Force\n\n# Our Frenchie Team :\n- Deffes Clément : Game Designer/ Art Designer / Sound designer\n- Couvreur Adrien : Game Programmer\n\n![Another2.png](///raw/dc4/8/z/8179.png)\t\n\n# Description\n\nThis game takes place in ancient Greece.

Once you click *start*, tabs will appear at the bottom that open different screens which give you an overview of your kingdom and let you invade other countries.\n\nThe first tab lets you control your homeland and look at its stats (though none of the actions work due to a bug). The **Population** tab gives you a quick rundown of how your population is split. The **Colonies** tab shows up once you've explored and colonised some land, and lets you manage colonies. **Resources** (one of the first tabs, and one of the most polished/functional) gives you an overview of your kingdom's stored resources and yearly yield and cost. **Explore** shows you all the lands in the game and lets you take land, giving you a rundown of what resources they hold and how many men you'll need to send in order to take the land. Once you've clicked on an action button, the \"Next\" button should show up and you'll be able to move on to the next year. You can perform up to 4 actions a day, and the rest will be put on hold until the next year.\n\nNote that to expand some options and menus you'll need to ensure you click on the actual text, not just the coloured box, and there is no mobile support, so it's recommended to use a desktop browser.

This is a physical card game!\n\n## Story\n\nYou find yourself stranded on the fabled island of Atlantis. Once a spectacular nation, now it lies in shambles due to a plague. You have a battery powered HEV suit for protection, but the battery power is running out. Play this exciting card game and see who can last the longest!\n\n## Requirements\n\n* A set of Save Atlantis cards. (A standard 52 card deck can be substituted for this)\n* A power die, perhaps a six sided die, for each player.\n* A token for each player. (a miniature figurine or a beer bottle cap)\n* 2 to 4 players.\n\n## Game Setup\n\n1. Shuffle the deck.\n2. Each player draws five cards.\n3. Place a single card face down on the table.\n4. Each player chooses and places a token on top of the face down card.\n5. Each player takes a power die and places it's highest value upwards.\n\n## Gameplay\n\nThe goal of the game is to be the last one in the game.\n\nIf your power die reaches zero (e.g. you have one power, and must reduce it) you are removed from the game.\n\n### Start of Turn\n\nEach player takes turns, starting with the cutest. (You may fight amongst yourselves over this qualifier)\n\n#### At the start of your turn:\n\n1. Reduce your power die by one.\n2. Draw a card into your hand.\n3. Draw a second card without looking at it, and place it adjacent to any card on the table.\n\n_Note: Your card must be able to fit on the table. If you only have room for one card, consider finding a larger table, you nut._\n\n#### Phase 2 - During your turn you may:\n\n1. Move to an adjacent card that is face down. \n\n* For every move you make, reduce your power die by 1. (You must have 2 or more power to move or you will die)\n* Flip that card right-side up and activate it. Follow the instructions on the card.\n2. Play any card from your hand.\n\n* Any card played may be countered (or nullified) by anyone who plays a card with a value higher than the card you are playing.\n* Face cards cannot be countered\n\nYou may choose to do (1) and (2) as much as you are able to. Your turn ends when you have exhausted your ability do either 1 or 2 or you declare your turn over. \n\n## Game play without Save Atlantis cards\n\n__These instructions are if you only have a standard 52 card deck__\n\nIf you activate a:\n\n* diamond (a recharge card), recharge your power die up to two.\n* spade (a bomb card), you may destroy any card on the table that does not have a player on it.\n* heart (a build card), you must draw a card, and place it face down somewhere on the table adjacent to another card.\n* club (a vision card), you may personally reveal a face down card to yourself. You can choose to flip that card face up. If you do, it does not activate.\n\nAces are low.\n\nIf you land on a face card, you must discard a card. If that card is a face card, you draw two cards and activate the face card's suit twice.\n\n## Build\n\n1. Run love (0.10.2) against the src folder, which builds the cards in your save directory.\n2. Move the cards to build/cards/\n3. run build/montage.sh from the build folder\n4. output-*.png is what you're looking for\n\n## Credits\n\n* Creative Direction, Game Mechanics and Programming: [@josefnpat](http://twitter.com/josefnpat)\n* Art and Playtesting: [@bytedesigning](http://twitter.com/bytedesigning)\n* Graphic Design, Playtesting and Asshatery: [@artschu](http://twitter.com/artschu)\n* Playtesting and Assistant Nacho Manager: [@chrisronin](http://twitter.com/chrisronin)\n* Playtesting and Music: [@eternalnightpro](http://twitter.com/eternalnightpro)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0f2/z/764e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/save-atlantis","author":{"name":"josefnpat","uid":752,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0f2/z/2b9e.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/josefnpat"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0f2/z/7a5a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0f2/z/7a5a.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Document","url":"http://missingsentinelsoftware.com/system/files/Save%20Atlantis%20Sheets%20PNG%20v1.zip"},{"label":"Document","url":"http://missingsentinelsoftware.com/system/files/Save%20Atlantis%20Singles%20PNG%20v1.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Science Runner starring Nucleus Poitras","category":"jam","description":"![screeny.jpg](///raw/899/8/z/767d.jpg)\n\nA simple BUT SCIENTIFIC!! runner game starring a certain Dr. Poitras who wants to increase his thigh muscle mass!!\n\nLink: http://crazyvillevariety.com/various/ScienceRunner.zip","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//899/8/z/76a0.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/science-runner-starring-nucleus-poitras","author":{"name":"SpotOnJ2K","uid":35224,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//899/8/z/4b8a.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/spotonj2k"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//899/8/z/767d.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//899/8/z/767d.jpg"}],"links":[],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Burning Low","category":"jam","description":"Platformer made for LD39, with art and music by Hiago Souza (Geminimax) and code and development by Guilherme Torres (Jegus9).

You can choose from three types:\n\n- Solar Panel (Upgradeable): small power gain, small price.\n- Coal power plant (Upgradeable): medium power gain, medium price.\n- Nuclear power plant (Not Upgradeable): large power gain hand in hand with an expensive price.\n\n![screenshot0.png](///raw/748/9/z/8123.png)\n\n![screenshot1.png](///raw/748/9/z/76e3.png)\n\n![screenshot2.png](///raw/748/9/z/77b8.png)\nUse WASD or the arrow keys to navigate.\n\nH to enter highlight mode (in which you can build an upgrade power plants).\n\nThe city grows randomly every 24 seconds, somewhat exponential. If you don't know what it means, don't worry. You'll find out soon enough.\n\nThere is a day/night cycle in which the solar panels will stop working so watch out for that (if you wonder why it doesn't get dark: your predecessor had a small radiation leak...).\n\nThe PowerMeter on the right shows how well (or bad) you are doing.\n\nYou will loose if your PowerMeter is negative for 20 seconds.\n\nThat shall be everything. Good luck and enjoy!\n\nPlease tell me if you discover any bugs.\n\nSometimes it takes a little bit to go from size 1 to 2. This is because the growth is slightly randomized.

You're no longer able to pause while spawning\n- Blobby (the slime enemy) now working as intended\n- energy usage for the super moves fixed (minimum threshold was too big)\n- keyboard layout changed (see above). Hopefully this will avoid problems with key ghosting on certain keyboards\n- game now compiled with YYC to fix performance on certain machine\n\n-----\n\nYou will find more info about the really fun development of the game on my profile! :D\n\nI hope you'll enjoy my little game! :)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e22/9/z/75c6.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/hyper-battery-girl-its-done-mostly","author":{"name":"Deke","uid":37422,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e22/9/z/4d16.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/deke"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e22/9/z/7607.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e22/9/z/7607.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dekedev.itch.io/ld39-hyper-battery-girl"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Crazy-Power-Rush","category":"compo","description":"![PowerRushLogo.png](///raw/831/b/z/72eb.png)\nWelcome to the world of energy!

Defend the tower with your life and **ensure the emp goes off before you run out of power.**    \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**-Controls-**\n\nUse 'WASD' to move around and aim with the mouse. Shoot with left-click and reload with 'R'. Interact with objects using 'E'.\n\n**The download is zipped up and contains two files, an exe and a data folder. You need both to play the game, so just unzip the files and double click the exe to launch!**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**-Game Tips-**\n\nWhen you spawn in you will see various tips informing you on how to play the game. There will be three pads you can interact with: 1 starts the game, 1 pad activates a forcefield, and 1 pad activates mines. **The mines and forcefield are your greatest defenses, so save them until the end where things get hectic.** Once you start the round stay near the emp tower and **shoot any robots that come near the tower.** Reload often and aim precisely. **Grey robots go for the core, while Red robots go after you.** Kite the red robots if you can and prioritize the grey ones. Once you have a large mass of red robots chasing you go activate the forcefield and it will fry all robots that come into contact with it and ones that are already inside. Activate the mines when there are lots of grey robots coming in, as the mines are set up right in the robot's path. **If you die simply reboot the game and try again until you succeed!** \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**-Contributors-**\n\n- **Lead Programmer** - Kryto627\n\n- **Programmer and Artist** - Calemi\n\n- **Programmer and Sound Design** - Flakey\n\n- **Music** - CaptainKray\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCheck out our Youtube channel and Twitter.

It is my first game jam and also my first 2d game. I have been using Unity for a little over a year now and have previously only done 3d games.

You must reach the end of each level with only a limited amount of fuel to power your tools.\n\nThe game is kinda finished, I had more ideas I wanted to implement but ran out of time.\n\n#### Credits:\n- Game made using GameMaker: Studio\n- Graphics made using Aseprite\n- [Space Fighter Loop background music by Kevin MacLeod](http://incompetech.com/wordpress/)\n- [Jet pack SFX by dklon](https://opengameart.org/content/rocket-launch-0)\n- [Enemy death SFX by spookymodem](https://opengameart.org/content/goblin-death)\n- [Flame thrower SFX by Nic3_one](https://freesound.org/people/Nic3_one/sounds/166542/)\n- [Fuel pick up SFX by joedeshon](https://freesound.org/people/joedeshon/sounds/139064/)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//071/z/7627.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/firepower","author":{"name":"akai_0okami","uid":368,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/akai-0okami"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//071/z/764d.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//071/z/764d.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://akai-0okami.itch.io/firepower"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://akai-0okami.itch.io/firepower"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Yo Ho Ho","category":"jam","description":"Want to know what it's like to be a pirate.

Furthermore, you have engines that will add to your score when operational. Finally, your ship has a generator that will disable everything if taken out. Failure to protect it will be punished. \n\nDifficulty is  your score and is calculated in a somewhat advanced way. Potential difficulty is given by distance traveled (ticking score) multiplied by a factor, but this is most often not the actual difficulty. True difficulty is given by the potential difficulty minus a fraction for each enemy alive, lowering it significantly and resulting in fewer spawns when you are in trouble. The maximum experienced difficulty is recorded for bragging convenience, but you should know that this can be no greater than 10.\n\n![screen1.png](///raw/1f1/8/z/73f8.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1f1/8/z/7524.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/space-is-dark","author":{"name":"Peter Jonsson","uid":33265,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//1f1/8/z/4aa0.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/peter-jonsson"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1f1/8/z/7527.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//1f1/8/z/7527.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1f1/8/z/7435.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//1f1/8/z/7435.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1f1/8/z/73f8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//1f1/8/z/73f8.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://digitea.itch.io/space-is-dark"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Surge","category":"jam","description":"Build defence pylons and keep them charged to withstand the crawler attacks.\n\nHow long can you survive?\n\nPlay in browser: [https://machinescreen.itch.io/surge](https://machinescreen.itch.io/surge)\n\n\n![screen4alt.png](///raw/577/1/z/7720.png)\n\n![screen5alt.png](///raw/577/1/z/7751.png)\n\n![screen3alt.png](///raw/577/1/z/775a.png)\n\n![screen1better.png](///raw/577/1/z/7a51.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//577/1/z/750f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/surge","author":{"name":"machinescreen","uid":6005,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/machinescreen"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//577/1/z/7720.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//577/1/z/7720.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//577/1/z/7751.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//577/1/z/7751.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//577/1/z/775a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//577/1/z/775a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//577/1/z/7a51.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//577/1/z/7a51.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://machinescreen.itch.io/surge"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Robot Head","category":"jam","description":"We are two university students who try to make games, we are working with unity for a year.

I usually go for Compo but I knew 100% life would be a factor so I figure why stress out.  I took my time and a great deal of breaks and you know what, I'm really happy with this entry :)\n\nThis is based a bit on an old Intellivision game called \"Atlantis\", similar to Missile Command.\n\nThe object of the game is to shoot down enemy's that are hurtling toward your city.  Why are they doing this?  They crave your power, or something like that.  You must manage your power usage throughout.  As you fire, power is consumed.  Power is also what protects your city from the invaders so as you use power be careful not to run out.  You can get power packs that randomly spawn from enemies to regain some of your reserves.  If you stop shooting you'll recharge but at a slow rate.  Enemies that make it through the shield will reduce your power and prevent recharging for about 1 seconds (firing your weapons also initiate a 1 second recharge delay).  If you manage to get your power above 100%, you'll start to do more damage with your weapons as well.  But be careful, the more power you have the more enemies will spawn ;)\n\nThe more enemies you kill the more of them will spawn.  At level 4, their speed increases and their hit points as well.  This will happen with each level after and there is no technical level cap, I've managed to get to Level 8.\n\nThere are a great deal of features I wanted to add but ran out of time but like I said, I'm really happy with this one and think I accomplished all of my \"Must Haves\".  \n\nTools:\nUnity/C#\nPaint.Net\nBfxr.exe (sound)\nBosca Ceoil (music)\nWith the exception of that lovely shield, all Art from Kenney.nl.\n\nThere is a WebGL version and it should work fine in this game.  Previously I mistakenly used the right mouse button for input and realized when it was too late that Mac users and Touchpad users were basically left unable to play.  This time around the controls are hopefully much better:\n\nFire Left Cannon:  Control's Fire 1 button, Left Mouse Button, or Keyboard \"A\"\nFire Right Cannon:  Control's Fire 2 button, Right Mouse Button, or Keyboard \"D\"\nDon't like the sound?  Press Keyboard \"M\" to Mute it and press it again to turn it back on!\nEscape to Quit (Windows Version).\n\nI'm beat tonight, will upload some screen shots and maybe a short video tomorrow.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//384/z/7496.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/invaders-from-the-next-planet-over","author":{"name":"SimplePotential","uid":1155,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/simplepotential"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://simplepotential.itch.io/ld39"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-ffmjRLPVREM04yVTlWVlZMOXM"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Jet Pengy","category":"jam","description":"Help Pengy to find back to his wife!\n\nUse the ice candies to freeze these bad seals!\n\nThen steal their jetpacks!

Please read the objective and controls before playing\n\nHave fun :)\n\n![ss2.png](///raw/254/8/z/7280.png)\n\n## Description:\n\nYou control an astronaut floating around in space after an accident.

There, you will see the lights designating your destination.

Gut instinct tells me they're bothersome. And maybe loud. Sorry.). And this time, instead of making my puzzle game \"abstract\", I've focused on a more logical ruleset. ...still, I think I might've overdone it. The puzzles this time might say absolutely nothing about their rules and are just \"unscramble this\" at the end. ...maybe I need to balance the two factors? Also, I've gone through weirder problems this time too. My AV suddenly starting to give a false alarm on the exported files (though for me, the solution is turning off the splash screen. I didn't really need it anyway, but why that.). I've also gone through some weird bugs and I had to diagnose the code deeply by seeing what happens when I remove this, add that... And once I've gotten enough info, I exploit the problem and fix it. I've gone through this before, but certainly not on such a deep scale. And as for the story and the dialogue font, I've made them in the last 8 or so hours, and I honestly had no time polishing any of those. Also this lacks an undo button. Mainly because this didn't even come to my mind.)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9bc/2/z/734d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/tower-of-morale","author":{"name":"Pixetrichor","uid":11449,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9bc/2/z/4a6d.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/pixetrichor"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9bc/2/z/7353.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9bc/2/z/7353.png"}],"links":[],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Bear and Bee","category":"jam","description":"Bear and Bee is thought as a simple touch game.

The ongoing energy crisis has led your tiny neighbors to extreme measures (as usual). You've turned off the lights to save on battery, but it's still not enough (par for the course). Desperate times call for that newfangled energy source: WIND.\n\nNow if only wind would gust on cue.\n\nHarness and redirect wind to shoot down those power-hungry grubs in all five levels of this tower defense game.\n\nAll code, art, and music created during the game jam!\n\nHTML Web: http://ludum.daretogame.net/tower/'\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS:**\n\nTo build a tower, press 'S' and click in a valid building space on the screen. (The tower will appear red if it is not a valid building space.) Building costs 100 power. To cancel building, press SPACE.\n\nTowers have two modes:\n\n**Autofire:** Tower expends energy to automatically shoot enemies.\n\n**Direct:** Tower expends less energy to shoot wind instead. Wind can travel anywhere on the map, but it does not damage enemies.  A tower in this mode does **not** shoot enemies.  It just redirects wind to other towers.  \n\nTo change a tower's firing mode, click on the tower. Then, press 'A' to change the mode to Autofire. Or, press 'D' and a wind icon will appear under the mouse. Click anywhere on the map and the tower will redirect the wind to wherever you clicked.  \n\nThe fortress does not have a windmill, so it cannot collect wind directly. However, any tower with full power becomes SUPERCHARGED and sends extra power back to your fortress. Manage your power carefully and take advantage of the time between waves.\n\nGood luck!\n\n![screenshot2.png](///raw/7ae/5/z/6c88.png)\n\n![screenshot1.png](///raw/7ae/5/z/6c89.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7ae/5/z/6c80.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/towers-of-power","author":{"name":"terryg","uid":4146,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//230/1/z/4b8d.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/terryg"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7ae/5/z/6c88.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7ae/5/z/6c88.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7ae/5/z/6c89.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7ae/5/z/6c89.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://ludum.daretogame.net/tower/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Running out of Butter","category":"jam","description":"You are a butter that was left out of the fridge.

When you click them, you convert the cost of energy on the icons into units that then get built.\nOn the right, te upgrades icons. When you click on them, it will upgrade the stats of your units (at a cost also).\n\nAt the center, you can see units that are \"in construction\" (as well as those getting upgraded), all waiting in the queue.\n\nBEWARE: the energy you spend on creating units is your life too!!! Don't let it get to 0 or you lose the game!\n\nThe map icon at the top left of the screen will take you to the map screen (the ones with all the villages).\n\n\n\n\nMap screen :\n\nYour base is the tower at the bottom of the map. The other cities are there for you to destroy them!\n\nIn order to do that, create some units using the flask screen first. Then, click on the tower, you army will be displayed in a pop-up message.\n\nIf you want to move them in order to attack a village, click on the button \"select\" on the pop-up message.\n\nThen, click on a village and click \"attack\". BEWARE: if you're defeated, there is no feedback in the game... sorry\n\nIf a village has a flag on it, it means that some of your units are in that village.\n\nYou can then click on that flag, select your units and move them in order for them to attack the next village (or regroup with the rest of your army in a different village before attacking, for example).\n\nWhen you attack a village, you gain some energy!!! And that doesn't depend on the combat's outcome.\n\n\n\nThat should get you started if you're a bit confused.

Well stop wondering and try it instead!\n\nIn Power Surge you can unleash you inner murderous​ robot and defeat an infected world of monsters. Conquer​ the leaderboard and show you friends how's the boss of this world!\n\n![PowerSurgeSplash.png](///raw/298/8/z/72cd.png)\n\nThe game was created for the Classic Ludum Dare Game Jam during 72 hours by a single developer (aka me Neathan). I used Unity 2017 as an engine and Paint.net for art.\n\n## ​Goal\n\n​The goal with the game is to kill as many monsters as you can and at the same prevent your batteries to run dry. When you kill a monster they drop energy essence. Just by walking close to the essence your battery automatically ​attracts and collects it. This will add charge to your battery that will help you to stay alive. If your charge reaches zero you're out.\n\n## Controls\n#### Keyboard:\n​Left Arrow + Right Arrow = Move\nZ = Jump   X = Shoot   Space = Start\n\n#### Controller: (Only windows)\nLeft joystick = Move\nX/A = Jump   Square/X = Shoot   Start = Start\nCircle/B = Alt Jump   Triangle/Y = Alt Shoot\n\n## Weapons\n#### Pistol\nThe pistol is the weakest weapon in the game. You are required to hit a monster twice to kill it with this weapon. however it has a high fire rate and a large ammo clip to compensate for this.\n\n#### Revolver\nThe revolver is twice as powerful as the pistol. It has a lower fire rate and not as much ammo but is generally easier to control since you only require 1 hit to kill a monster.\n\n#### Rifle\nThe rife is a bit different from the other weapons. Instead of using normal bullet it's using high velocity bullets to penetrate a whole line of enemies. This result in a deadly weapon that is useful to clear lines of enemies with only 1 bullet. The cost of this is the low ammo clip size which makes you think twice before you firing a round.\n\n#### Rocket Launcher\nThe rocket launcher uses high explosive rounds that do damage in an area on impact. This weapon has a mediocre fire rate and ammo clip size but is useful for when enemies have stacked up and are close together.\n\n#### Shotgun\nThe shotgun is the only weapon in the game that shoots multiple bullets at once. This weapon has, just like the rocket launcher, a mediocre fire rate and ammo clip size which makes it good to use in almost every situation.\n\n![Splash.png](///raw/298/8/z/72d9.png)\n\n## Download\nYou can either download the game directly from github bellow or from the games Itch.io page: https://neathan.itch.io/power-surge\n\n#### Web:\nFollow one of the following links to access the web version: https://neathan.github.io/Running-out-of-Power/ https://neathan.itch.io/power-surge (Doesn't work with Safari. Chrome and Firefox confirmed to work)\n\n## Install\n#### Windows:\nSimply extract the rar or zip file and place its content wherever you please.  One thing to note is that the executable (.exe) has to be in the same directory as the PowerSurge_Data folder. (Windows defender might warn you that the program is from an unknown source, just press show more and run anyway to start the game)​\n\n#### Mac:\nJust extract the rar or zip file and you have your app. (You might have to right click on the app and the select open to be able to start the game)​\n\n## Change log\n* Disabled rifles debug ammo.\n* Fixed bullet collision problem.\n\n## To note\nOne thing to note is that the game was originally only made for 16:9 resolutions but since many mac computers use 16:10 i implemented a work around for that. But as a result of this the level itself will not look as good as it would in a 16:9 resolution. Even though it's a minor design flaw I would still recommend that you play the game in 16:9 if you have the option.\n\n## Source\nThe source is available at: https://github.com/Neathan/Running-out-of-Power\n\n## Itch.io\nThe game is also published on itch.io.

It explains how to brew a coffee, step by step. \n\n1) Your first look goes to the customers at the counter, see their coffee wishes. The amount of beans indicates, how many beans you have to fill in the coffeemill. Does the costumer have a glass milk over his head he wishes his coffee with milk. Sometimes he wants a cup of pure milk. \n\n2) So you put the amount of beans in the coffeemill, pay attention that the coffeemill tray is in the coffeemill. Then you press 5x shift to get the beans milled. Yaay your first selfmade ground coffee! Get the stuff out of the mill by pressing enter and put them into the coffeemachine.\n\n3) In the next step you get water for the coffee. Go to the water glass on the left, grab it by pressing enter and put it in the coffee machine.\n\n4) Activate the coffee machine by pressing shift and wait for the coffee to brew. While waiting you can set up other things e.g. get a coffee cup or put new beans to the mill.\n\n5) Wait for the coffee to get brewed. Meanwhile you can set up other things e.g. grab a cup or put new beans to the mill.\n\n6) Get the coffee from the coffeemachine, go to the cup and press shift to fill it. \n\n7) Put the coffeepot back to the coffee machine. \n\n8) Customer is happy and spend you a tip :smile:\n\n\nThe ludum dare version lacks of telling you exactly what to do and how to brew coffee. We are sorry for that :cry: \nWe try to deliver you a better experience of the game in the next few weeks. \n\n\n## Links \nYou can **download** the game on  [itch.io](https://marinwin.itch.io/inhouse-baristas)!\n\n## Changelog\n01.08.2017: Small bugfix considering inputs.

The more fuel rods you have, the faster nuclear reaction will be. After start you can operate control rods, inserting rods will slow down reaction - better not to have lack of them. \n\nDo not exceed critical tepmerature - there is no way back, if you do! \n\nYou have three days (three minutes of game time), weather is changing and have influence to amount of water (which is necessary for cooling). \nYour task is to generate power (and in the first place, not to expolode), will you make it to top ten score? \n\nHave fun playing!\n\n#### Executables information & Requirements:\n\nThere are two different versions - first of them are executables (Windows - which should be preferred, Linux and OS X - I built Linux and OS X version using Unity on Windows - so no guarantees about them), second is WebGL build.\n\nDownloadable ones are better quality, with full resolution textures, more complex shader effects and post processing, and generally the gameplay will be more smooth. WebGL build is optimized, yet still somewhat a lot slower compared to downloadable ones.\n\nSo, if you can - please try downloadable version. If not, please give us feedback about WebGL version.\n\nHigh scores are saved when you win the game (that means if you don't blow up), although only from executable versions.

Thrust forward with \"W\" to move in the direction you're facing. **You may have to work against your current velocity!**\n\n*Boosting:* Boosting will increase your speed at its current velocity. You can only boost when you're thrusting! This is a good way to change directions, but be careful, because it drains your fuel quickly.\n\n*Trading Health for Fuel:* If you don't have a lot of enemies shooting at you, you might find your fuel is running low. You can trade 1/3 of your health for an equal amount of fuel.

Be warned, please avoid listening to any stray broadcasts, we promise you, they are meaningless. If a broadcaster happens to stay in our system too long, this is a breach of security!

The Mac one may require you to change some security settings on your Mac. Also, please note that the WebGL version differs slightly as you cannot multi-thread in WebGL, so the game may lag slightly when pathfinding.\n\n### Tips\n\nRead the messages provided by the game. First, build solar panels to slow down the loss of power. The first mine to be built should be a silicon mine. Stabilize first, then start to grow. Remember, mines MUST be powered to work.\n\n### Goal\n\nYou must build certain items to complete the game. These can be checked by clicking the Check Colony button on the screen. Also, the ship's battery can not be losing power.\n\n### Tools Used\n\n- Unity 5.6.0f3\n- Bfxr for creating sound effects\n- GIMP 2 for image editing\n- Bosca Ceoil\n\n\n### Contributors\n\nFor posterity sake, this game was developed completely in 72 hours by myself and my two sons.

New game designs, new algorithms, new technology. In this time I had an opportunity to work with HTC Vive hardware. So I decided to make my first VR game. I have no wish to compete with other participants. My plan is to use LD as a motivation kick.\n\nIn the result, I'm happy. I made VR game that I have fun to play. It's quite challenging even for me, but after 3 days of playtesting I can guarantee that game can be beaten.\n\nAlmost all 3D models and textures I get from Unity Asset Store (some of them free, some of them paid). Most of the sounds from FreeSound.org. But the whole level was assembled by me from scratch and there a lot of places to walk (without gameplay rewards, unfortunately). For the VR locomotion I used scripts from Asset Store. After playing different games I came to a conclusion that arm swinging is the best solution to locomotion after teleporting. But teleporting ruins immersion, what is the main feature of VR technology.\n\nI recommend you to launch the game on Ultra setting. There no heavy effects and game are pretty optimized.

Make sure you have enough wood before night falls. It is colder when its night so players who are outside lose warmth faster.\n\nBlog Post: https://imgur.com/a/ls2K1\n\nControls:\nWASD:\tMove\nSpacebar:\tPickup\nLeft Shift:\tSprint\n\nUI\nOrange Bar: Warmth Bar\nRed Bar: Health Bar\nWood Bar: Indicates wood is being burnt for heat","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a30/2/z/7059.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/winter-survival-game","author":{"name":"glauz","uid":8250,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/glauz"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a30/2/z/706f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a30/2/z/706f.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://goo.gl/m5Kkwo"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Lights Out","category":"jam","description":"Lights Out is the result of my first attempt at Ludum Dare.

You can move the obstacles to reach to the warp with shooting but BEWARE, a collision with an asteroid will cause the spaceship to rise it's shields, wich is very power-expensive![gameScrt1.PNG](///raw/e0b/8/z/6e51.png)!","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e0b/8/z/6e3e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/s-o-sspaceship-out-of-supplies","author":{"name":"Sancho","uid":35598,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/sancho"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e0b/8/z/6e51.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e0b/8/z/6e51.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://sos.ticloop.com"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Delivery Bot","category":"jam","description":"Delivery Bot is an infinite runner where you must deliver packages to earn points and collect batteries to stay charged.

An unpowered turret is dead. You can get power by collecting batteries spawned by the synthesizer at periodic intervals. Keep collecting them to have a larger power bank!\n- Scrap is used to speed up battery generation from synthesizers, and to revive unpowered turrets. Scrap is left by dead enemies.\n- Turrets shoot on their own and lose power continuously even if they are not being attacked. You need to recharge them continuously. For turrets, power = health.\n- Once all turrets are powered down, enemies start attacking the core. The game is over when the core is destroyed.\n\nControls:\n- WASD to move.\n- Aim with mouse and use Left Mouse Button to hook and pull yourself to a point. Press W/S while hooked to a point to release.\n- Hold Space to recharge turret \n- Press Space to revive unpowered turret / boost battery generation on synthesizer.\n- F1 to toggle fullscreen.\n\nGeneral Tips (things you'll realize while playing anyway):\n- Boost synthesizers often to generate more batteries.\n- Scrap goes away after a few seconds, make sure to collect as much as possible for boosting / late-game revivals.\n- Sometimes it might be better to let some turrets die and camp near specific suitable spots.\n\nMore Screenies!\n\n![ss2.png](///raw/d8e/z/6d80.png)\n\n![ss3.png](///raw/d8e/z/6d85.png)\n\n![ss5.png](///raw/d8e/z/6d87.png)\n\n![ss6.png](///raw/d8e/z/6d88.png)\n\nMade by Diptoman Mukherjee (programming / design), Pranjal Bisht (art / level design), Rahul Salim Narayanan (art) and Joel Montpetit (SFX) for #ldjam #ld39","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d8e/z/6d7d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/zapdune","author":{"name":"diptoman","uid":3725,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d8e/z/348b.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/diptoman"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d8e/z/7f61.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d8e/z/7f61.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d8e/z/84ff.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d8e/z/84ff.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d8e/z/6d80.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d8e/z/6d80.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d8e/z/6d85.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d8e/z/6d85.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d8e/z/6d87.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d8e/z/6d87.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d8e/z/6d88.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d8e/z/6d88.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://gamejolt.com/games/zapdune/273223"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://gamejolt.com/games/zapdune/273223"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/7y0po8q91y44uy9/ZapDune.zip?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Electric Castle","category":"jam","description":"*Welcome to my first Ludum Dare!*\n\nYou are an eye - don't ask why - stuck in the **Electric Castle**.

Recharge the station before it's power level\nreaches zero!(and keep your power as well).\n\nNOTE: If Windows gives you a warning about the installer, simply\nclick more info and run anyway.\n\n![mainScreen.JPG](///raw/56e/7/z/6d3a.jpg)\n\n![midLevel.JPG](///raw/56e/7/z/6d07.jpg)\n\n![greenPowercore.JPG](///raw/56e/7/z/6d0a.jpg)\n\n## Development Timelapse Video\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEhz_UZs1L4","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//56e/7/z/6d71.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/energizing-mini-quest","author":{"name":"hoogmin","uid":32357,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//56e/7/z/4b32.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/hoogmin"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//56e/7/z/6d3a.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//56e/7/z/6d3a.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//56e/7/z/6d07.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//56e/7/z/6d07.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//56e/7/z/6d0a.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//56e/7/z/6d0a.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://gamejolt.com/games/ld39_energizing_mini_quest/273245"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Turn Out","category":"jam","description":"![HighresScreenshot00000.png](///raw/9d3/3/z/6d1c.png)\n\nAbout\n=====\n\nTurn the world and reach the goal before running out of power.\n\n![HighresScreenshot00002.png](///raw/9d3/3/z/6d4f.png)\n\n\n![HighresScreenshot00004.png](///raw/9d3/3/z/6d50.png)\n\n\n#### Post Jam Changes\n\n2017-08-02 Added Linux and Mac builds","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9d3/3/z/6d10.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/turn-out","author":{"name":"Vovin","uid":13273,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9d3/3/z/6dcc.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/vovin"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9d3/3/z/6d1c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9d3/3/z/6d1c.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9d3/3/z/6d4f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9d3/3/z/6d4f.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9d3/3/z/6d50.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9d3/3/z/6d50.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://vovin.itch.io/turn-out"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://vovin.itch.io/turn-out"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://vovin.itch.io/turn-out"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Power","category":"compo","description":"![eyyyyy2.gif](///raw/553/6/z/887a.gif)\n\nDont let your enemies take control.

Three different difficulties to choose from, so feel free to play at whatever skill level you're comfortable with! \n\nA short 8 level game about trying to escape form a shadow world. Each of the non-boss levels has a different objective, and there are 3 enemy types, 3 bosses, and 3 environments. \n\n**Tips for Players**\n\n* Always, always stay on the move. Crows spawn continuously and you only have so much light!\n\n* Always try to keep track of your ammo, if you run out you may find yourself stuck.\n\n* Yellow dots are batteries, blue dots are pickups.\n\n* Don't spend too much time in the light of those creepy laughing statues. They will hurt your sanity fast and cause enemies to spawn at unmanageable rates.\n\n\n**About this Project***\n\nI made this myself from scratch.

It depends of their tastes - and who knows the exact tastes of everyone he just met ?)\n\n\n### **================================ :muscle: Bug fixed since the first publication**\n\n- :rainbow: Fixed colors (somes clients had the same color as other elements (background), now you should see them correctly !)\n- :point_up: Fixed ending text (there is 5 endings and not only 2 : 3 bad endings and 2 \"good\" endings)\n- :coffee: Fixed client's tastes (giving every clients just a hot chocolate made them happy ! There were missing a condition to check if they totaly like the meal or not...)\n- :eyes: Fixed client's panel (you could click on a client, talk with him, close, re-open the window and them talk with him again. Same with baking meal.

You must figure out how to start a mining operation to extract this gold in the most efficient and compact manner possible. But beware, it takes power to export this gold to the rest of the world, and so you must be careful to keep your power from *running out*. In the beginning, you will only have solar panels, but as you progress, you will gain access to steam engines, and will eventually be forced to set up the infrastructure needed for them. Filling the world with solar panels just won't cut it once you have too many mines for them to keep up with.\n\n*A Decent Mining Operation:*\n![A decent mining operation](///raw/9d1/7/z/6c37.png)\n\n\n## Controls\nLeft Click - Place whatever you have selected\n\nRight Click - Destroy what your mouse is over (Gives you half your money back.)\n\n(Pretty simple, right?)\n\n## Basic Tutorial\nFirst, place four solar panels in a line near a patch of gold and run power lines so that each solar panel is adjacent to a power line. (Most everything can interact with a power line on the 8 tiles surrounding it.) Power lines only connect to each other in the 4 cardinal directions. Place a mine on a gold tile, and connect it to your power network. The \"!\" should disappear when the mine gets power. If you hover over it, you can see the mine's progress and power consumption. Other machines will behave in a similar way. You should start seeing gold be added to your inventory while the solar panels are generating power. Solar panels are useless at night. Placing a gold seller beside a power line will start to sell gold from your inventory for $10 a piece. 1 of these can keep up with two mines. Be careful, to sell gold you need power, so if you *run out of power*, you won't be able to sell gold. You now have a basic mining operation that will mine and sell gold during the day. Now the rest is up to you. I suggest adding another mine. You may need more solar panels to power it. Good luck.\n\n\n[**Click here to play**](http://gre.cobaltrisen.com)\n\n## How to use the steam engines\nAs almost every single comment so far has mentioned that the steam engines are confusing, I may as well talk about how they work. Pipes are used to transfer fluids and behave similarly to power lines. Boilers take coal from your inventory, and when fueled will heat your pipe network by 20 degrees each. They don't connect to pipes on their bottom face. Steam engines are what make power, and require 100 degrees of temperature and 10KL of water each. Water's standard temperature is 20 degrees with no boilers, therefore you need 1 pump and four fueled boilers for the first steam engine, and 1 pump + \nfive boilers for each additional one. If there isn't enough power or fluid available, a machine simply won't run.\n\n## Tools/Languages Used:\n- Code: HTML, CSS, JavaScript\n- SFX: [Chiptone](http://sfbgames.com/chiptone/), [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org)\n- Icons: Photoshop CC\n\nI plan to continue developing GRE, so if you have any suggestions, let me know!\n\n## Updates\n- Fixed boiler price mismatch (Thanks @brazmogu)\n- Made Power and Fluids easier to read from pipes and lines.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9d1/7/z/7133.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/get-rich-efficiently","author":{"name":"CobaltRisen","uid":29145,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/cobaltrisen"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9d1/7/z/6c37.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9d1/7/z/6c37.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://gre.cobaltrisen.com"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Power Runner","category":"jam","description":"![Screen Shot 2017-07-31 at 3.42.48 PM.png](///raw/a48/8/z/6ce0.png)\n\n![Screen Shot 2017-07-31 at 3.44.11 PM.png](///raw/a48/8/z/6ce1.png)\n\nWelcome to Power Runner.

You can move in 4 directions and to do so you'll have to use your devices.\nFor instance, to move to the right, it's super easy : You put your second device on the right of the first one\nand you just pinch ! The second device become the new spot where you and your friend are (as seen on\nthe mini map in game) and you keep on going until you find the exit ! (before you run out of power and die a horrible death of course ^^)\n\n## Dev process\n\nFor this LD, the theme being running out of power, we thought about an \"escape before\nit's too late\" kind of game but with a interesting twist in the gameplay.\nIn this game, to move from one room to another you use 2 real life devices\nto build your path !\nWe used a library called [Swip JS](https://github.com/paulsonnentag/swip) that let you connect several devices (smartphones, iphones, ipads,\nor even a laptop with touch screen) with only one move, a pinch on the screens.\n\nSince we had to go on the LD39 journey with a super small team, we decided to keep\nall the other fancy elements, like graphics or music, super low key with room for future\nimprovements.\n\nAll assets have been made during the event.\n\n## Screenshots\n![begin.gif](///raw/88f/2/z/6c3a.gif)\n\n![ezgif.com-optimize.gif](///raw/88f/2/z/6ca5.gif)\n\n![first-screen.png](///raw/88f/2/z/6c97.png)\n\n![second-screen.png](///raw/88f/2/z/6c9a.png)\n\n![finish-screen.png](///raw/88f/2/z/6c9c.png)\n\n### Controls\n- Move : Your fingers\n\n\n## Set up Project\n\n### Install dependency\nThe project has one dependency : NodeJs.\n\nSo first let's install it :\n\n#### Windows and MacOs\nYou can download installer on the [NodeJs website](https://nodejs.org/en/).\n\n#### Linux\nOpen a terminal\n```\n    sudo apt-get update\n    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -\n    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n ```\n\n### Compile and start the game\n\nYou have to get the sources.\nTo do it, you need to download the ZIP folder of the game on [Github](https://github.com/guillaume-gomez/LD39) (like in the picture below).\n\n![github-download.png](///raw/88f/2/z/8379.png)\n\nFor the next steps, let's consider that you **have extracted the ZIP** directly in the Downloads folder (you can extract it whatever you want but you will need to adapt the path in the command lines in the next part of the guide).\n\n## Build from sources\n\n#### Windows, Linux and Mac\nOpen a terminal, and type the following\n```\ncd Downloads/LD39-master\nnpm install\nnpm run build\ncd client\nnpm install\nnpm run build\ncd ..\nnpm start\n```\n_The last command launch the server_.\n\nOk, so your serveur is started (Do not kill the terminal until you stop playing the game).\nNow you can see the result on your computer, to visualize go to `localhost:3000` on your favorite browser.\n\nThere is one last step to connect your portable devices (Smartphone, Iphone, Ipads, Kindle, etc).\n\nYou will need your network local address by typing in **another** terminal (your devices need to be connected on the same network as your pc by simply connecting your device on WIFI).\n\nSo on linux, and mac, open a terminal and enter\n```\n  ifconfig\n```\n\n![ipv4-mac.png](///raw/88f/2/z/837b.png)\n\nFor instance my local address is `192.168.1.125`\n\nOn Windows, on a terminal too, and enter\n```\n  ipconfig\n```\n\n![ipv4-windows.png](///raw/88f/2/z/837a.png)\n\n\nFor instance my local address is `192.168.1.125`\n\n**The local adress can change, so don't hesitate to check this address. It may changed when your computer leave the network (basicaly when you turn off your computer)**\n\n## Let's play\nYou can now play the game easily.\nOpen a browser on both your devices, and type `(YourLocalAddress):3000.` (in the case above `192.168.1.125:3000`)\n\nThe game will start on your devices.\n\nIf something went wrong, don't hesitate to restart the server by killing the terminal where the server is running.\nAnd restart it with command `npm start` (in the folder LD39-master of course)\n\nEnjoy !\n\n_the server can be still buggy :| , but I will work on it_\n\n\n\n## Team\n- Maxime Lambert: Concept / Game Design\n- Guillaume Gomez: Programming","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//88f/2/z/6d0d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/pinchscape","author":{"name":"Guillaume Gomez","uid":12168,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//88f/2/z/8605.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/guillaume-gomez"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//88f/2/z/6d13.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//88f/2/z/6d13.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//88f/2/z/6c3a.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//88f/2/z/6c3a.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//88f/2/z/6ca5.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//88f/2/z/6ca5.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//88f/2/z/6c97.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//88f/2/z/6c97.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//88f/2/z/6c9a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//88f/2/z/6c9a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//88f/2/z/6c9c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//88f/2/z/6c9c.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//88f/2/z/8379.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//88f/2/z/8379.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//88f/2/z/837b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//88f/2/z/837b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//88f/2/z/837a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//88f/2/z/837a.png"}],"links":[],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Low-Speed Internet Space Robot Adventure","category":"jam","description":"The quest of a lonely robot on a distant planet who just wanted to play his favourite online game.\n\n![teaser4.png](///raw/865/2/z/6c9e.png)\n\nPlay as long as you can before your internet connection dies, collect energy stones to keep your computer running, and make a little robot very happy ! \n\nI was super busy this weekend but I wanted to participate.

(WebGL)](https://ninjascribble.github.io/LudumDare39/) ⇷\n--\nhttps://github.com/ninjascribble/LudumDare39\n\n### The Story\nThe H.M.S. Hrothgar has been destroyed by a fleet of enemy invaders. You are the only survivor, but your weapons systems are down and your fuel tanks are running low.\n\nThere might be just enough energy crystals floating in the debris to get you home, but can you break through the enemy's lines?\n\nGood luck, soldier. We're counting on you!\n\n### The Tools\n* **Game engine**: [Unity 2d](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/2d-game-creation)\n* **Graphics**: [Pyxel Edit](http://pyxeledit.com/) and [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/)\n* **Sound**: [Chiptone](http://sfbgames.com/chiptone/)\n\n[![Cover Image](///content/65a/1/z/6c3e.png)](https://ninjascribble.github.io/LudumDare39/)\n\n### Tips\n* Tap the Left and Right arrow keys to move around.\n* Use the Up arrow key to deploy energy reserves. You only have three, so use them wisely!\n* The hit boxes are small enought that you can _just_ sneak through enemies in formation.\n\n### The Process\nHonestly, we went into this Ludum Dare with an idea of what _kind_ of game we wanted to build before\nthe themes were even announced. The classic top-down shmup has always been one of my favorite genres\n-- the sense of speed and the immediacy of each movement you make combine to put me into a relaxed\nlittle zen-like state where I can lose hours at a time.\n\nOf course with only a weekend to build something from scratch, there weren't hours to lose! Graphics\ncame first on Friday night, and we were done with the basic gameplay by the end of the first day.\nDay two saw the addition of enemies, some tweaks to the game speed, and all of the non-gameplay scenes.\n\nYes, you _can_ win. I've done it exactly once, and it's damn hard to make it happen. If you do manage\nto win, you'll be rewarded with a short story screen and the chance to play again, although... the\ngameplay might be broken as of the current build so it's best just to reload your browser instead. Heh...\n\nThis was the first entry we've made using Unity 2D. I've been avoiding it because stepping out of code\nand relying on the IDE tends to make me nervous. And yeah, we did have some trouble using the collaboration\ntools (lost work at the end of day 1, no fun), but in the end it did speed up development and make a\nfew things (like supporting fullscreen) a lot easier.\n\nThis was also the first time I've had the chance to use [Chiptone](http://sfbgames.com/chiptone/),\nwhich makes building game sounds a breeze.

So balance your resources between building and powering defenses and launching the rocket. More details about the gameplay are available in-game. You'll see it when you play the game(it will take less than 5 min to play through it, so make sure you go give it a shot!), so let's move on to the creation.\n\nWe decided upon this idea after the reveal of the theme. To be honest, we weren't too happy about the theme due to it leaving comparatively little room for deviation and interpretation, but decided to take part anyway. The overall creation process was surprisingly smooth. We ran into very few bugs during the programming, and no hunches or anything in ideation or asset creation. So yay. Wasn't sure if we could do it, but here we are, finished with, like, 7 hours left.\n\n### Setup\n\nEngine: Unity3D\n\nGraphics: Autodesk Maya 2017, Photoshop CC\n\nAudio: Logic Pro X, Yamaha AG03, NI Guitar Rig 5 Pro\n\nI hope you spare some time to rate our game, and look forward to being part of another jam.

There's:\n\n- A drill, which is the main goal\n- Weapons to defend from attackers on the ground\n- Shields to defend from air strikes\n- Support systems that will very slowly give you more energy.\n\nIf the attackers or air strikes get through, you lose energy.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis project was going really smoothly up until the last quarter day, where I found a major bug in the code that synchronizes the sliders. After fiddling with the section of code for several hours, I decided that I was too tired to be able to fix it. As a result, the sliders can sometimes combine to be more than 100% of the maximum power. The enemy damage and spawn curves were left somewhat unpolished and on the easy side. The connection to the theme suffers as a result. If I can manage to shrink the bloated code down and find the bug, I might finish the enemy numbers and release an updated version that's better balanced.

A lot of energy is required to keep Ludum Dare working and you don't want her to run out of it, do you? For this reason, she recruited you to get the souls of your fellow programmers, artists and designers which she feeds on.\n\nThat's right, you have to slay your way through the Ludum Dare community.\n\nYou impersonate a great, bearded and four-eyed man which must kill the goblins (which are the impersonations of your fellows, interesting choice) so that Ludum Dare can get the souls she needs. Ludum Dare is impersonated by a beautiful and hard-to-get witch, that helps you with a magic shield. However, keeping the shield activated consumes souls, so you may want to gather them fast. Beware, staying outside of the shield will lower your health because of the toxicity of the dungeon (goblins pollute their environment too). Goblins can't go through the shield, so you may want to fight them from inside of it and to go outside just to explorate the dungeon. Throughout the dungeon, you may find some ruins which have powerups for you. You can take them by dragging and dropping them on the two slots in the lower part of the screen. Be careful with powerups, since they consume souls each time you activate them. The witch will stay still unless you tell her to follow you.\n\nControls:\n- WASD: player movement;\n- left mouse button click: player attack;\n- Q and E: activation of powerups, if taken;\n- SPACE: witch follows you;\n- ESC: pause the game.\n\nIntro:\n![intro.png](///raw/d82/9/z/6b07.png)\n\nIn game:\n![lots1.png](///raw/d82/9/z/6b0b.png)\n\nPowerups:\n![pu.png](///raw/d82/9/z/6b0d.png)","thumbnail_url":"","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/ludumswitch","author":{"name":"Tommy","uid":1962,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/tommy"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d82/9/z/6b07.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d82/9/z/6b07.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d82/9/z/6b0b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d82/9/z/6b0b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d82/9/z/6b0d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d82/9/z/6b0d.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://giveitatry.altervista.org/Games/LD39/LudumsWitch.html"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/ccm4uy7bhutwy3r/LudumsWitchMacOSX.app.zip?dl=0"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/bw2ujksrsm0kynn/LudumsWitch.rar?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","mac","desktop","win"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Fully Powered: Enough power to save the world","category":"jam","description":"![Screenshot_26.png](///raw/289/z/6aa6.png)\n\n**Fully Powered** is a **2D shooter with optional coop**.

You need control your link ship to add power for the customer. Hurry up, They only stay here for seconds. \n\nAfter running out of power, you need to drive your ship to collect it, your ship also has the power limits, try to get back to main ship before running out of power, then you would save one ship or you need spend money to buy another one.\n\nHow to play:                                                                                                        \nuse A and D key to control the ship. SPACE key to open/close the magnet panel.\n\n\nI done this all by myself, unluckily I didn't got time to add audio for the game. I try to make audio by myself, as a new music learner it really took me lots of time still the work came out bad. At last I decide not use it. This thing also made me miss the dead line of compo. Hope next time I can improve my music skill and join the compo.\n\nThanks for your voting.

But I'm already happy I managed to put some procedural generation together. :)\n\nThere are some known bugs, sadly I won't be able to fix them before the deadline. One that can be very frustrating is that the AI always chase you on the y axis, so if you're out of mana you won't be able to get pass the Will O Wisps, and also they won't be able to attack you as you continue moving - generating a stalemate state one can end only by quitting the match.\n\nHopefully, I'll be able to make it a bit better next weekend.

If people like the game then i may continue it. It's basically in a prototype stage\nI had planned to have different stages , a map of the town, random events, complaints etc, emergency power surges, safety inspections. \nAlso that pixel art is obviously 11/10 ;) \n\nHow to play :\n=============\n- Make sure you have at least one powercell to power the generator. if you dont have any your warning level will increase.\n\n- If your warning level increases and you dont think you have enough time to put on another cell then you can press the on off lever to shutdown the generator and halt the warning however when the\n  generator turns back on again it will slow down production of energy for a short time.\n\n- The more cells you have the faster the generator will create power. \n\n- You can sell cells by right clicking them.\n\n- You can buy sells by visiting the shop [Dollar button].\n\n- You can see stats and additional help by pressing the blue book button. \n\nGoals :\n===========\n- Generate enough power for the connected sources by Thursday and keep the power running until Friday to win the game.\n- Try to gain at least 1 Hamster Cell.\n- Keep the regulators in the right boundaries.\n- Keep Up-time above 95%\n\nFines :\n===========\n- You will be fined if 2 of the regulators are incorrect for more than 10 seconds.\n- You will be fined if there is not enough power for Thursday.\n\nYou will gain Bonus' for keeping the regulators [2 round things] within the correct boundaries.

The lower the energy is, the slower you go and the lower you jump.\n\nYou use arrows to move around, 'SPACE' to enter things and 'ESC' leaving.\n\nIf you leave the game clicking ESC enough times, the scores will be saved(in \"%localappdata%\\ld39\"). \n\nThere is a special hidden ending that involves the game freezing.

The ship is automatically navigating to reach the closest station, while sending a distress call. Rescue is on the way, but there's not enough energy to sustain the ship before they arrive.

BUT. After starting the game, make sure that your in-game phone and your real-phone's rotations are same. For me playing it was while holding the phone facing south worked accurately. Might be different for you. Do try moving the phone around. Have placed dummy phones in the Home Menu and the Help Screen.\n\n## UPDATE\nI tried to fix the controls, but some bugs always keep popping up. I will try to fix it in the weekend when I have time(no college). \nBut, I added a compass text, to show the player if he's heading south. 0 means south, and the game works without any problem when facing south. Do let the game use your location(for compass only). \nKeep the value within 0 - 20 for best experience.

Didn't have time to change the font so that's just a direct rip from lazyfoo's SDL setup tutorials. It was pretty interesting going back to basics and having to think about every little detail. Ah... Manually making spritesheets, setting up my own pathfinding, texture management being the first thing you have to do before even prototyping, giant message polling to parse out events, nothing like a trip through the good old days to make you appreciate what you have.  Except I still spent like 2 hours trying to get xcode to build/link properly some things are eternal.\n- I'm done designing puzzle games where you can't display the score as the game is in progress. It's too confusing. Score here is derived by the total pieces used in the SHORTEST paths to each house, with a different cost for each node ( 1 for green squares, 5 for normal, 30 for red ) and a penalty x3 times the number of pieces wasted. Since we can't know what's wasted until the entire grid is complete it's hard to explain. Also since the levels are random ( if I had more time I probably would have just picked some rand seeds I liked ) it's hard to tell people what a \"good\" score is, probably at < 150 or so on most levels I saw.\n- Another thing I had to cut was originally green squares were worth negative points. Meaning you could actually end up with a better than 0 costs, as if someone had paid you to lay out the tiles. It didn't really work with the fiction so it confused 100% of playtesters ( all one of them and I kind of agreed. ) Disappointing because one of the cool things about video game A* is that nodes can have negative costs, which isn't allowed in the real world.\n- Speaking of A* shortest paths, I didn't think of this until I was done but it's really confusing when all path's don't highlight and only the shorest ones do. I find I'm often confused that the long paths don't work if there was a shortcut already found. I should have just followed all tiles and not done real pathfinding.\n\nTools:\n- SDL2\n- MSPaint ( RIP )\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//17b/1/z/675c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/power-grid-graph-nightmare","author":{"name":"ultrarat","uid":7025,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//17b/1/z/87c8.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/ultrarat"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//17b/1/z/6787.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//17b/1/z/6787.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ht4e83gup3tain/LD39PowerGridGraphNightmare.zip?dl=0"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/chh3a1zmqhgh1d7/LD39APowerGridGraph.app.zip?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Ultimate Hacker","category":"jam","description":"Pilot a remote drone and hack your way through the level to reach the elevator.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//13/z/6785.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/ultimate-hacker","author":{"name":"Predominant","uid":49,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/predominant"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://hmm.slavitica.net/3O3q3r1M2W0j"},{"label":"macOS","url":"http://hmm.slavitica.net/1Z2N3B1s2U2l"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://hmm.slavitica.net/0H2h0T3c323J"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"PowerMan","category":"compo","description":"Hello everyone,\n\n\nHow to play:\n  - Download the. jar file.\n  - Open the Jar\n  - Have Fun!\n\n\nErrors:\n  - If you find any Errors / glitches make sure to tell me in the comments, so I can fix them!\n\nTools:\n - Java\n - Photoshop CS2\n - LMMS\n - Audacity\n\nControls:\n - Left-Right: ArrowKeys\n - Jump: W or Arrow-UP\n - Hover: E\n - Shoot: F\n - Stab: R\n\nAbout:\n - Me:\n     I'm Constantin, a 14-year-old German Java and web developer.\n     I do programming as a hobby and not commercial.\n\n - Game: \n    It's a 2D java platformer, you have to get to the flag, By hovering and shooting, you lose energy.

I've tried my best to get as much content in as I could (there's now 62 different events for a total of 1014 lines of manually typed scripts), but time is limited in an event like Ludum Dare and I couldn't get in as much as I wanted to.

Each player has 4 game pieces, which are in the\n\"out\" area when the game starts, and which must be brought into the player's \"home\" row.\nThe rows are arranged in a cross position. They are surrounded and connected with a circle of fields, over\nwhich the game pieces move in clockwise direction. There are 3 fields nearest to each side of the board; the\nleft one is the player's \"start\" field and the middle one leads to the \"home\" row.\nThis means that each game piece enters the circle at the \"start\" field, moves (clockwise) over the board and\nfinally enters the \"home\" row. The first player with all of their pieces in their \"home\" row wins the game.\nThe players throw a die in turn and can advance any of their pieces in the game by the thrown number of dots on the\ndice.\nThrowing a six means, you are allowed to throw the dice again, unless you are out of power. If a piece is on\nthe \"start\" field and there are still pieces in the \"out\" area, it must be moved as soon as possible. If a piece\ncannot be brought into the game then any other piece in the game must be moved by the thrown number, if\nthat is possible. Pay attention that throwing dice continuously without moving is forbidden and by each dice\nthrown you have to make a move.\nEach throw consumes 1 power from your battery. Without charging the battery, you have a maximum option\nto roll 10 dices. Energy can be regathered by either moving over a charging field, or skipping your turn.

The player might even use this to their advantage by utilising the alien's advanced technology to rebuild their spacecraft.\n\nControls:\nW - accelerate forward\nA or D - rotate left or right\nSPACE - fire bullets\nE - upgrade spacecraft (when available)\n1 to 6 - use respective element (listed at the top of the screen) to regain power\n![main.png](///raw/932/3/z/5fc9.png)\n\n![scav.png](///raw/932/3/z/5fcd.png)\n\n![orb.png](///raw/932/3/z/5fce.png)\n\n![level1.png](///raw/932/3/z/5fcf.png)\n\n![level2.png](///raw/932/3/z/5fd0.png)\n\n![level3.png](///raw/932/3/z/5fd1.png)\n\n![hyperdrive.png](///raw/932/3/z/5fd3.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//932/3/z/5fc4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/space-jam","author":{"name":"anaglyphcoding","uid":12857,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/anaglyphcoding"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//932/3/z/5fc9.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//932/3/z/5fc9.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//932/3/z/5fcd.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//932/3/z/5fcd.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//932/3/z/5fce.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//932/3/z/5fce.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//932/3/z/5fcf.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//932/3/z/5fcf.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//932/3/z/5fd0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//932/3/z/5fd0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//932/3/z/5fd1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//932/3/z/5fd1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//932/3/z/5fd3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//932/3/z/5fd3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.mediafire.com/?nt3jego1qjq212b"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Batterime","category":"compo","description":"You control a little computer that must regenerate by touching conductive platforms in order to continue to progress trough the level.\n\nControls :\nMove: Left & Right arrow keys\nJump: Up arrow or Space bar\nRun: Left shift\nReload Level: R\nMenu: Escape","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//123/9/z/66d7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/batterime","author":{"name":"Hadrien","uid":37665,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/hadrien"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://hadrien.co/batterime/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"On The Gird","category":"compo","description":" The game is an electricity grid simulator, simple concept, you make electricity then sell it to make money. If you get bankrupt it's game over. The Gird in the title is not a typo it's absolutely intended.\n\nHOW TO PLAY\n\nYeah wish i had time for a tutorial. Start with placing a line between the 2 generator, or you get bankrupt before noon in the first day :P  You basically have 5 building blocks:\n\nCity\n\nThis block consumes energy according the time of the day. As time passes they use more and more energy. If you deliver the energy to the city you get money for exchange, but if you fail to meet the demand you pay double for the undelivered capacity.\n\nLine\n\nUse this to plug transformers together\n\nCoal Power Plant\n\nPower Plant. Generates power by burning coal. Electricity generation has a cost so take care that you are generating as much as you need and not more. You can change the plant capacity by clicking on it and changing the \"Target capacity\". Please note that it's take some time before the plant reach the targeted capacity.  New plants start at 0% capacity.\nSolar Power Plant\n\nPower plant. Generates power during daytime. Cheap, power generation is free, don't working at night.\n\nTransformer\n\nThe electricity is flowing between transformers(of course only if there is a line between them). The power plants deliver their power to a transformer and the city takes the electricity what he need from one. Please note that a transformer only can do one job at a time, it is either in Input or Output mode but not both.\n\nTIPS\n\nMaking electricity and transporting it cost money, but cost less than not making enough for the customers. Try to make just enough to maximize your profit(if there is no green or red indicators in the graph then the generation is optimal).\nDon't go above the transformer capacity or it's stop working","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//3f/z/66c4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/on-the-gird","author":{"name":"aeai","uid":243,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/aeai"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://aeai.itch.io/on-the-gird"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Power Hero","category":"compo","description":"![Intro.png](///raw/b75/8/z/687c.png)\n\n![screenshot2.png](///raw/b75/8/z/687d.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b75/8/z/5ec5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/power-hero","author":{"name":"autovelop","uid":34171,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b75/8/z/4e03.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/autovelop"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b75/8/z/687c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b75/8/z/687c.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b75/8/z/687d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b75/8/z/687d.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://fanus.itch.io/power-hero"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://fanus.itch.io/power-hero"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://fanus.itch.io/power-hero"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"B:/ Connected","category":"jam","description":"![IE2sCC.png](///raw/e47/z/66b4.png)\n//////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nB:/ Connected\n\nby\n\nAidan Markham\n\n\n\nAdditional Writing by\n\nKain McCall\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////\n\n![2017-07-31 01_31_38-Unity 2017.1.0f3 Personal (64bit) - Main.unity - ld39 - PC, Mac & Linux Standalo.png](///raw/e47/z/66b5.png)\nHints:\nPress h at any time to see a list of allowed commands. \n\nHere are some example commands:\nm 1\nl\nt r\n\nPlease report any bugs you discover!\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e47/z/66ae.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/b-connected","author":{"name":"AidanMarkham","uid":1870,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/aidanmarkham"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e47/z/66b4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e47/z/66b4.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e47/z/66b5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e47/z/66b5.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://aidanmarkham.itch.io/connected"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Chase","category":"compo","description":"You need to hijack a train.

Simple mechanics! \nYour reputation hits 0 = you'r fired. \nIf you get fired the day will reset. \nYou can lose the reputation by doing bad things. \nYour reputation is refilled every day. \nYou have limited money. 1 beef = -10$. 1 sold hamburger = 20$. \nCustomers can also ask soda. \nThe amount of orders depends on the day (next day will always be harder) \nYou have limited power. You can shut objects down by right-clicking them. \nClick the phone number list (on the left) to buy more power. \nYou can buy power using your charisma or company's money or your boss's money. \nPress enter to leave early (and get fired) \n\nThere is not a limit to the day amount but it will get very hard quickly. \n\nGood luck! \n\nKnown issues: \nWhen your shift ends or you run out if power the subtitle will flicker a bit.

Resources are displayed underneath the HQ building.\n\n**Turrets**\nThe turrets fire on enemies in range. Enemies will also attack the turret when fired upon. If the turret’s red heath bar drops to zero it will be destroyed and a new one will have to be built.\n\n**HQ**\nThe HQ must be protected at all costs. It will use its power to repair itself, but if it’s red health bar drops to zero the game is over.\n\n**Upgrading**\nTurret fire rate can be upgraded up to level 5. Between enemy waves an icon will appear below each turret along with the cost of the upgrade. Stand on the icon and press the action button to purchase the upgrade.\n\n**Building**\nThe cost of building is displayed at each vacant hard point. To build or replace a turret or build the second drill, walk to the relevant hard point and press the action key.\n\n**Enemies**\nEnemies will be spawned in waves of increasing numbers. They can only be destroyed by turrets, so keep them charged!\n\n\n**Tools Used**\n\nUnity 2017 + VS, GIMP, SFXR\n\n**Other / assets**\n\nWavySpriteby Andrii (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/89634)\n\nFoliage by Warlock's Gauntlet team (https://opengameart.org/content/top-down-foliage-collection)\n\nGround Tile Set by chabull (https://opengameart.org/content/ground-tileset-grass-sand)\n\nMusic Midi by RenzoSquall (https://www.yout ube.com/watch?v=6DIhPJK081c)\t\n\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f16/2/z/658a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/power-struggle-3","author":{"name":"Kriss","uid":9759,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/kriss"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f16/2/z/658d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f16/2/z/658d.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f16/2/z/658e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f16/2/z/658e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f16/2/z/658f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f16/2/z/658f.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f16/2/z/6590.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f16/2/z/6590.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://ksowinski.itch.io/power-struggle"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Run and Slash","category":"compo","description":"![1.png](///raw/e13/8/z/5e2d.png)\n\nYou are a common barbarian and the most fabulous dungeon awaits you.

More expensive buildings tend to be more complicated to operate, but will use less power!\n- Pushers will push every second gem that passes them onto the next belt over.\n- Try to have the most $ when the ⚡️  reaches zero!\n\nNB: I didn't get to tweaking the buildings in time, so the recipes available aren't yet fleshed out.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ce8/a/z/6580.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/the-last-gem","author":{"name":"nornagon","uid":43244,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/nornagon"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ce8/a/z/658c.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ce8/a/z/658c.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ce8/a/z/658b.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ce8/a/z/658b.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://nornagon.github.io/the-last-gem/last_gem.html"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Hamster Wheel Simulator","category":"jam","description":"The power has run out, and you have to get the hamsters moving.\n\nRecharge your batteries by getting the hamster to run!\n\n![Screen Shot 2017-07-31 at 8.07.53 PM.png](///raw/a57/z/7f0a.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a57/z/6582.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/hamster-wheel-simulator","author":{"name":"Laaph","uid":1882,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/laaph"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a57/z/7f0a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a57/z/7f0a.png"}],"links":[{"label":"macOS","url":"https://laaph.itch.io/hamster-simulator"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://laaph.itch.io/hamster-simulator"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://laaph.itch.io/hamster-simulator"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["mac","desktop","win","linux"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Super Charged","category":"jam","description":"![photo_2017-07-31_08-04-02.jpg](///raw/938/9/z/6557.jpg)Super Charged is an arcade game about a tiny little electron trying not to lose it's negative charge.

The three fixes were:  \n- Couldn't win by opponent skulls (see comments below) - I corrected one variable name (`EnemyHealth`) in one place to fix this.\n- Rare unclickable boxes - I added one line of code (`\"blew = false\";`) to fix this.\n- Increased sound volume on several `WAV` files to make them more audible\n\n![Tycoon.jpg](///raw/c66/z/641e.jpg)\n\n![Tycoon2.jpg](///raw/c66/z/6421.jpg)\n\n![Tycoon3.jpg](///raw/c66/z/6442.jpg)\n\nSource code here:\n http://planktongames.com/TycoonSources.zip\n\nTools: Unity, Goldwave, PowerPoint, GIMP, Propaganda free font by Apostrophic Labs","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c66/z/638c.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/tycoon","author":{"name":"dob","uid":1644,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c66/z/6543.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/dob"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c66/z/641e.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c66/z/641e.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c66/z/6421.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c66/z/6421.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c66/z/6442.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c66/z/6442.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://planktongames.com/TycoonBugFix"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Ragdollish","category":"compo","description":"You are a jiggly, wobbly, physics-driven character trying to keep the power on by pressing buttons and pushing cubes onto buttons!\n\n![ragdollish.gif](///raw/564/3/z/6407.gif)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//564/3/z/63df.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/ragdollish","author":{"name":"thunderawesome","uid":13413,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/thunderawesome"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//564/3/z/6407.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//564/3/z/6407.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6BUL4bcK_EYV0lTTkxWeXdRYTA"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6BUL4bcK_EYejlobTU0S3laMmM"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Failing Empire","category":"compo","description":"Welcome to Failing Empire!\n\n![Screenshot_1.png](///raw/436/8/z/645a.png)\n\nIn this management game build power plants, parks and other buildings to help boost your failing resources.

However the game is fairly easy to beat. With more time, there are definitely many ways to improve and expand on this game. This was also my first attempt at both making a video game and using Game Maker Studio.\n\nI wish there was music, but that concept requires a lot more discipline than i have anticipated.\n\nI am also aware that there might be a few bugs here and there that i have neglected due to a lack of time.

Each player controls one of the rabbits and each rabbit holds controls part of the flying drone: one player aims and the other shoots. It's meant to be played by two players side by side, one using the keyboard and the other the mouse. The controls are in the title screen.\n\nI wanted to copy the Bungee Buddies minigame from WarioWare: Smooth Moves and add some things into the mix. The idea was to make a game for two players using a single Wiimote-Nunchuk. After a few hours, I realized I was going to spend the entire weekend messing with technical stuff and that even if I succeeded, most of my potential players don't own a Wiimote and a bit of effort is required to connect one to your PC (at least on Windows).\n\nSo, I dropped the idea of having the players physically jump. And for the compo, I decided to have it use the keyboard and mouse.\n\nI think it's interesting, but I didn't quite nail it. Despite having spent most of Sunday creating and balancing the difficulty progression, I feel it's too easy for me, so it's ultimately kind of boring. It could definitely use more content, too.\n\nWhat I learned from making this is that, for this type of game, you need to carefully consider your restraints for generating obstacles. The biggest difficulty I had was with the energy: energy is health and ammo in this game, so how much energy the players receive is what affects the balance most. You need to make sure the game doesn't become unreasonable at any point, but if you don't design your game correctly, it becomes very hard to make sure it's neither too easy nor too hard. I get the feel that there's some crucial design change I need to make to avoid this problem.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading! I hope you have fun with the game!\n\nUPDATE: You can now customize your controls.\n\n\n![start.png](///raw/512/z/61d9.png)\n\n![screenshot1.png](///raw/512/z/61db.png)\n\n![screenshot2.png](///raw/512/z/61df.png)\n\n![screenshot3.png](///raw/512/z/61e5.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//512/z/6039.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/escape-from-power","author":{"name":"Petzi","uid":533,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/petzi"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//512/z/61d9.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//512/z/61d9.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//512/z/61db.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//512/z/61db.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//512/z/61df.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//512/z/61df.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//512/z/61e5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//512/z/61e5.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://app.box.com/s/g0z46uul1mshq3jbcwqsqzola2zswip5"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://app.box.com/s/kodw8dj2izvksgt6iv2sh8e3nrp6881f"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://petzi.itch.io/escape-from-power"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://petzi.itch.io/escape-from-power"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Last Question","category":"compo","description":"![banner900x250.png](///raw/b39/1/z/644d.png)\n\n**In lieu of a tutorial, here's more or less how the mechanics work**\n\n**Please read this before playing**\n\nThere's a story told starting 30 seconds from when you create your first drone. Try and keep the AC powered to hear it through. And keep your volume up.\n\nWhen you create a drone, you get a console you can type in on the left of the screen. If you input **HELP** you get a list of commands.\n\nTo acquire power to feed the Cosmic AC:\n1. **JUMP** to a planet\n2. find a laptop or fusion core (use the **RENDER** command to get a first person view)\n3. bring a drone with a *CABLE* to a laptop, or a *FUSION REACTOR* to a fusion core, and use the **DRAIN** command while facing it\n4. **JUMP** back to the home forge\n5. use **DEPOSIT** to transfer power from your drone to the AC\n\n\n**Some other notes**\n - drones with a *REFUELER* can be used to move power to and from drones. This is useful if your drone is stuck with no power. Just send a refueler to it. Use the **TRANSFER** command, with a positive or negative value.\n - drones with a *GRABBER* can **PICKUP** laptops and fusion cores, and **JUMP** with them, but must **DROP** them before other drones can use them.\n - a drone with a *HAMMER* can **CRUSH** a drained laptop or fusion core. A drone with a fusion reactor can then **DRAIN** additional power from the wreck.\n - use **INSPECT** when facing any object to learn how much power it stores.\n\n**Now on to the description.**\n\nFeels like every other game I make I'm happy with, and the rest are kinda shit. This one feels kinda shit, sorry about that.\n\nGame's inspired, and features, Asimov's short story \"The Last Question\". All audio is ultimately created by me, but if you feel that I shouldn't be entering the Compo with the text of a cult science fiction story, then feel free to rate things as though it wasn't there.\n\nI don't know if it's possible to beat the game, I didn't have the time to check because I was staring at my digestive tract for the last 6 hours of the compo, attempting to set it on fire with my eyes so it'd be less painful.\n\nEnjoy or something. I dunno.\n\n[Also there's a postLD version which I recommend using](http://amras.dowolnanazwa.pl/ludumdare/39/postLD/win86_LastQuestion_postLD.zip)(\n[Win](http://amras.dowolnanazwa.pl/ludumdare/39/postLD/win86_LastQuestion_postLD.zip), \n[*Nix](http://amras.dowolnanazwa.pl/ludumdare/39/postLD/nix86_LastQuestion_postLD.zip), \n[OSX](http://amras.dowolnanazwa.pl/ludumdare/39/postLD/osx86_LastQuestion_postLD.zip)).

You control a small little robot as he tries to grab batteries (the green rectangles) strewn about the environment and return them to the recharging station while trying to avoid being drained of your energy by the bad (red) robots.\n\nThere's only one small problem, you are slowly running out of power.  Every time you move, you use up a unit of energy.  You can recharge yourself at the recharging station, but you can only move so far before you must return to recharge.\n\nUpon collection of all four batteries, the game moves to the next level, in which the enemies then move twice as far in a turn as the previous level.  There are theoretically infinite levels.\n\n**Controls:**\n\n-On Windows you can use either WASD to move (R restarts from the beginning) or the on-screen buttons.\n\n-On Android you must use the on-screen buttons\n\n**Extra info:**\n\nThis game was programmed using the Corona SDK (which uses Lua for it's coding/scripting language).","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//42f/8/z/6024.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/charge-hunt","author":{"name":"abou123","uid":36644,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//42f/8/z/5023.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/abou123"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//42f/8/z/62c4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//42f/8/z/62c4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://mega.nz/#!EQ4GlaTZ!FomFlOYdR2yRKK-YL-v8Ihp80VvUtS_w8zUvaMDVc2k"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://mega.nz/#!hZITAQQL!8qDuhXFtlGP574004K37aR7uQFQDW_G0vXl4tTU_3QE"},{"label":"Android","url":"https://mega.nz/#!oAhWkCwT!U0ypM9__EkFeTeEqBeKELKmwT6R2g48uiUXBA7aFkZY"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mobile"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"SuperZero","category":"compo","description":"You are a super hero who's powers are failing you.

Your job is to get rid of them. We are firing rockets at the junkyard world to help blow up the garbage, but our military aren't very good shots and always seem to miss the planet's surface.\n\n**There are 5 kinds of boxes, which drop faster as the game progresses**\n\nJust Boxes: They're just boxes.\n\nTNT: Explodes when near another explosion.\n\n2-part Explosives: If parts one and two touch they will explode.\n\nDecay: If these are destroyed they are worth no points.

There is a period at the beginning of the name so that it appears first in the directory, but if you have trouble running it, rename it.\n- When launching the game, it will ask you to press space to the beat of the music. **This isn't just a title screen gimmick, it's a calibration phase,** so keep that in mind! Enjoy the game!\n\n## Controls\n- **Fire weapon:** D\n- **Recharge:** A\n- **Jump:** W\n- **Shield:** S\n\nAll inputs have to be coordinated with the beat of the music and the flashing of the background in order to register. At the start screen, you calibrate the music beat with the visuals by pressing space to the beat as you hear it.\n\n## Creation\n- **Programming:** Python and pygame\n- **Art and animation:** Paint.NET and a nice Python sprite sheet class\n- **Music:** Sibelius and an online MIDI to WAV converter\n- **Sound effects:** SFXR\n\nI made all assets during the 48 hour period, and used no external sound, music, or image samples.

He needs your help collecting batteries to keep his fuel up so he can keep chugging along!\n\nAlong the way you'll be able to pick up one of three power-ups. The **solar panel** which allows you to periodically generate your own power, the **gas can** which increases your maximum fuel capacity, and the **efficiency drive** which decreases the rate you lose fuel.\n\n![game2.png](///raw/52c/2/z/6165.png)\n\nHow long can you help this poor robot from running out of power?\n\n![endscreen.png](///raw/52c/2/z/616b.png)\n\n*Recharged: A game about collecting batteries*\n\n## Tips\n- When possible, grab the solar panel and efficiency drives. On their own they're both pretty nice (especially solar panel) but as a combo they're very strong.\n- Batteries get rarer as the game goes on (starting from once a second to once every 3 and a half seconds) while your fuel usage doesn't change. Don't get discouraged if you can't get past a few minutes (my high score is 2 and a half min in testing).\n\n### Comment your high score below!","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//52c/2/z/6179.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/recharged","author":{"name":"EX3D0","uid":11301,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/ex3d0"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//52c/2/z/616f.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//52c/2/z/616f.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//52c/2/z/6165.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//52c/2/z/6165.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//52c/2/z/616b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//52c/2/z/616b.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://exedo.itch.io/recharged"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://exedo.itch.io/recharged"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://exedo.itch.io/recharged"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Breathless Parks - Running, out of Power","category":"compo","description":"Welcome to Breathless Parks!\n\n![screen0.png](///raw/8b0/1/z/609b.png)\n\nYou spend your time hanging out with your fellow ~~inmates~~ residents.\n\n![screen1.png](///raw/8b0/1/z/6164.png)\n\nThe only problem is that you cannot decide on what to watch on TV.

I currently have no internet access nor a working phone, and last night (the first day of the compo) we were hit directly by a Category 2 Typhoon.  I walked about a mile to find open wifi with my phone so that I could find out what the theme is and start on my entry, more than a full day after the compo began, so I ended up with fewer than 23 hours to make my entry.

The countryside has experienced a major power outage, and it’s up to you to re-wire the grid and restore power.\n\nThe game is essentially a basic math puzzle combined with a “pipes” style grid. You install and remove power lines and resistor towers to make sure the houses get the correct amount of power.\n\n## Controls\n\nMouse only. Select a tool using the bar at the bottom of the screen, click on the grid to place it. Click on an existing piece of hardware to remove it.\n\n## Goals\n\nI wanted to make something simple and polished, or, as polished as a Comp entry can be. During my last LudumDare, I overshot and ended up producing little more than a tech demo with some minor humor. This time around I wanted to make sure I actually built something I could call a “game”.\n\nIt may not be the most imaginative or complex thing in the world, but it feels significantly more refined than my last entry.\n\n## Issues\n\nUntested in Firefox, please use a WebKit or Blink based browser for now. Chrome recommended.\n\nIn some cases a power line can be placed in a three-way connection with two generators and a resistor. This often makes it look like the lines are leading to the resistor, but are actually ignoring it.\n\nLinking a resistor in a loop to another resistor causes a power drain and drops them both to 0.\n\n## Tools\n\nGame written entirely in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. \nGraphic work was done in Photoshop and processed through CodeKit 3.\nMusic was generated with WolframTones. \nSound effects generated with Bfxr.\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![screen_1.png](///raw/f99/2/z/6176.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f99/2/z/611e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/lights-out-1","author":{"name":"Brandon Diaz","uid":10655,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f99/2/z/3c9d.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/brandon-diaz"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f99/2/z/6187.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f99/2/z/6187.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f99/2/z/6176.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f99/2/z/6176.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/BrandonDiaz/ldjam39"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://rezeyu.itch.io/ldjam39"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Spare Crow","category":"compo","description":"Top down, point and click, survival.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e89/8/z/6106.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/spare-crow","author":{"name":"TwoWolfGames","uid":35214,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/twowolfgames"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://two-wolf-games.itch.io/spare-crow"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"⚡Current City⚡","category":"compo","description":"![Rastergrafik.png](///raw/83d/8/z/61ae.png)\n\n\n# What is ⚡Current City⚡?\n⚡Current City⚡ is an art of citybuilder where energy is one of the primary limiting factors!\nIt is also my first entry at a Ludum Dare and so the graphics are relatively basics and at the moment it's have relativly much (too much) information in text form. \n\n# Downloads:\n\n## SUBMISSION HOUR Version\n\n###### 5:58 (1:28 after deadline): Fixed Spelling in tutorial\n\n**Linux** (Universal): http://jannk.de/Projects/ldjam/Linux.zip\n\n**Windows** (x86_64): http://jannk.de/Projects/ldjam/Win.zip\n\n**Mac OS** (Universal): http://jannk.de/Projects/ldjam/Mac.app.zip\n\n**Web:** http://jannk.de/Projects/ldjam/\n\n**Source:** https://github.com/JNKrambrich/ludumdare39/tree/ldjam\n\n\n## After Jam\n\n### [Changelog](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/current-city/current-city-after-jam-update-1/):\n- **Added** language \"German\"\n- **Added** Volumeslider\n- **Added** NumberPopup\n- **Fixed** hitboxes of Districts\n- **Fixed** many more\n\n**Web:** http://jannk.de/Projects/AfterJam/\n\n**Source:** https://github.com/JNKrambrich/ludumdare39/\n\n# The Tutorial\n![State.gif](///raw/83d/8/z/6276.gif)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//83d/8/z/60e9.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/current-city","author":{"name":"JnKrambrich","uid":36152,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/jnkrambrich"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//83d/8/z/61ae.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//83d/8/z/61ae.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//83d/8/z/6276.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//83d/8/z/6276.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://jannk.de/Projects/ldjam/"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://jannk.de/Projects/ldjam/Linux.zip"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://jannk.de/Projects/ldjam/Win.zip"},{"label":"macOS","url":"http://jannk.de/Projects/ldjam/Mac.app.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","linux","desktop","win","mac"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Power: The Wims of the People","category":"compo","description":"It is your job to guide the world into a new era of energy, by building up the infrastructure network and replacing old facilities.

In the game player has multiple generators\nthat they can power on and off at will, and they provide power. While powered generators are getting damaged, and if they are destroyed, player can't use them until they are fully repaired.\n\nBuildings generate tasks that need to be done. Tasks require power to be executed, some will lose the progress, if they lose power access. In order for building to perform tasks player needs to click on them, to power them. While they are powered they will consume power to progress the task. Task progression is scaled by the efficiency (amount of power you are producing/ amount of power required) so if your efficiency is low, tasks will progress slower, and also the generators will struggle and get damaged even more. So try to keep the efficiency high.\n\nIf you fail 3 tasks, the game ends and you are presented with the score you achieved.\n\nThe game has 3 level types that are randomly generated with predefined power generators (each level type uses different generators). Sadly didn't get the chance to make it so the player can pick which generators they want to play with.\n\nMove the camera using WASD and zoom in and out with numpad + and -, or scroll wheel.\n\nThe game might not be balanced, I didn't have much time to play and balance the game properly.\n\nGame was made with:\n   -Unity2D (GameEngine)\n   -Blender (All building images were generated using blender)\n   -Photoshop (Mostly for tutorial images)\n   -Bfxr (The game has only one sound that is played on click :D.

I hadn't found the time with Uni.\n\nThis game is basically a test of fire for an idea I have, project \"hope\", which is about making bullet-hell where the game knows every bullet's position at all times from (essentially) the very beginning. This allows for some funky stuff -- mostly time shenanigans.\n\n\n\n\n# Links\nGame HTML5 https://agecaf.github.io/ai-runaway/index.html\n\nSource https://github.com/Agecaf/ai-runaway\n\nCode Base https://github.com/Agecaf/studious-happiness\n\n## About the Game\nYou are an AI Overlord who decides to run away from (your position of) power. Alas, your processing power is so huge that the star drone you're escaping in is rapidly running out of power. Especially if you use your powers or lose your armor.\n\nYou can always exchange your powers for power or armor... But if you run out of powers, only fate knows what'll happen.\n\nBut what are your powers, you ask? Hmm, nothing special, just things simple like going back in time, detaching yourself from this plane of reality, warping the nature of space, and, probably the best in your arsenal, moving a bit faster.\n\n## Power Showcase\n\nWant to see how the powers look like? Or do you want to see how \"Lunatic\" is not so lunatic with the right choice of powers?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlMHpF_jk4c&t=7s\n\n*It is really when you're using powers that the theme of this ludum dare comes in.*\n\n## Easy Mode Showcase\n\nWant to see how you can do Easy mode, even without powers?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJWmDr40pL4&t=3s\n\n----\n\n\n# External Resources Used\n\n- I used my code base for project \"hope\" in html5 (https://github.com/Agecaf/studious-happiness). This contained the basic notions of poses (points with rotation and time), movements and bullets. None of the code from the demos was used, though one of the demos was used as inspiration for one of the boss' patterns.\n\n- I'm using font-awesome (http://fontawesome.io) for the icons (stars, battery) (They don't have a half-heart for some reason, which prompted the creation of our star drone).\n\n- I'm also using the Days One and the Nunito fonts (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Days+One , https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito).\n\n# Internal Resources Created for the Game\n\n- All the art (using Inkscape and abusing the \"create stars and polygons\" tool) \n- The music [Using sunvox + kiarchive samples. I wanted to add a boss song and sfx but ran out of time :'(  ]\n- All the damn level design. It was much more work than I expected. 600 lines of grambled code.\n- All of the layout, except the canvas (taken from the codebase).\n\nI also extended the codebase with a couple of useful or important functions, most notably compoundBezier and updateAtTime. They'll be added to the codebase eventually.\n\n# Inspiration\n\nThe game itself is clearly inspired by the Touhou Project, most notably by Impossible Spellcard for it's use of powers. Some of the powers are inspired by that game (Leave Ghost <-> Doll, Fast Forward <-> Cape, Warp Edges <-> Umbrella).\n\nThough I'm not a big sonic fan, I have fond memories of my cousin playing Sonic Heroes. The music is inspired by City Escape. I started trying to play something like it, and then changed it until I had a melody I was happy with. It was appropriately named \"Night Escape\".\n\n## About Project Hope\n\nI've been toying with functional programming, and wanted to make bullet-hell games with functional ideas. This basically means that each bullet is really an object that already knows its position at all time. \n\nI then abstracted the idea that bullets are \"things that have to be rendered\" and \"things that can hit you\". So are bullet groups. So is the background (just that it never hits you). So is the text. Everything's a bullet!\n\nSo project \"hope\" is about composing building blocks to create \"functional\" bullets.\n\nThis has some benefits such as\n\n- It is really easy to make time shenanigans. Almost as simple as ```t -= dt;```\n- It is easy to reason about your patterns (\"It's bullet range with N bullets which are this sprite with linear movement...\")\n\nBut also some drawbacks such as\n\n- It is much harder to do time-step things such as player-centered gravity.\n- It is much harder to do \"bombs\", i.e. selecting bullets by area and removing them. This also holds for \"killing enemies\".\n\nProject \"hope\" has had three iterations, the first in Scala with libgdx, the second in javascript with HTML5, and the third (work in progress) in Lua with LÖVE.\n\nI'm favoring the Lua version since I wanted to make it \"moddable\" (i.e. just pop in a file and get a level, possibly with the whole game changed), and Scala just has a horrible compile time, whereas in lua it's a breeze. \n\nScala's syntax and typechecks are just beautiful, so I might rework the Scala project to make it only for non-moddable games.\n\nThe HTML5 version is there mainly so that I have an online demo. It desperately needs changes to help with typechecks etc.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//51a/9/z/605f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/ai-overlord-runaway","author":{"name":"Agecaf","uid":39445,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//51a/9/z/4e63.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/agecaf"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//51a/9/z/6a2d.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//51a/9/z/6a2d.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//51a/9/z/6a41.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//51a/9/z/6a41.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://agecaf.github.io/ai-runaway/index.html"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Running Low","category":"compo","description":"# Running Low\n---------------------------------\nThe ship has been invaded by aliens and they've managed to turn off the reactor.\nIts only a matter of time before we lose power.\nFind the reactor and turn it back on before your power runs out.\n\nOh and you may want to avoid the aliens.\n\n## Controls\n---------------------------------\n- Right mouse to drag the camera round\n- Wheel zoom to zoom in and out.\n- Left click to plan route, click again to begin movement.\n- Left click to interact with objects in the environment.\n- Space to cancel movement.\n\n## Software Used\n---------------------------------\n- Unity 2017.1\n- Krita\n- Visual Studio\n\n\n## Links\n---------------------------------\n- [Build](http://www.selftitledgames.net/games/ludumdare39/RunningLow.zip)\n- [Source](http://www.selftitledgames.net/games/ludumdare39/source.zip)\n\n## Screens\n---------------------------------\n![Screen1.png](///raw/142/z/7077.png)\n![Screen2.png](///raw/142/z/707a.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//142/z/6058.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/running-low-1","author":{"name":"SelfTitled","uid":577,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//142/z/3cbb.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/selftitled"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//142/z/7077.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//142/z/7077.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//142/z/707a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//142/z/707a.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.selftitledgames.net/games/ludumdare39/RunningLow.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"HellOnEarth","category":"compo","description":"\n![BG.png](///raw/839/z/6b20.png)\n\nHell On Earth is a top down wave survival game created in under 48 hours for Ludum Dare 39.\n\nPlay it here: https://officialdingbat.itch.io/hellonearth\n\nControls:\n\nShoot - Left Mouse\n\nShotgun - Right Mouse\n\nMove - W, A, S, D\n\nPurchase Ammo - E\n\nPurchase Health - Q\n\nSuicide/Restart - R\n\nSkip Cutscenes - Space\n\nScreenshots:\n![screenshot0.png](///raw/839/z/6b19.png)\n\n![screenshot1.png](///raw/839/z/6b1c.png)\n\n![screenshot2.png](///raw/839/z/6b1d.png)\n\n![screenshot3.png](///raw/839/z/6b1e.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//839/z/602a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/hellonearth-1","author":{"name":"Dingbat","uid":2360,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/dingbat"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//839/z/6b20.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//839/z/6b20.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//839/z/6b19.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//839/z/6b19.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//839/z/6b1c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//839/z/6b1c.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//839/z/6b1d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//839/z/6b1d.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//839/z/6b1e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//839/z/6b1e.png"}],"links":[],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Fading Light","category":"compo","description":"Hi, I decided to join the LD 39 like four hours ago and I made this thing.

I approached the theme by making a VERY simple power plant tycoon where you need to cover demand all the time.\n\n## Instructions\n1. Drag coal by left-clicking anywhere in the coal cart into the generators.\n2. You can buy coal underneath the cart. Left click over the \"0\" on the bottom left and use it as an input field(It's counter intuitive I know...)\n3. The more coal you buy the cheaper it is but the longer it will take to arrive. \n4. All the energy gets dumped into the battery and from there you'll feed the demand. You can buy extra battery storage space by clicking on the button underneath it.\n5. You can only have 8 generators. You can buy them in the bottom center for 50€.  \n6. Important, the number on the bottom right is the money you have. \n\n__Last as much as you can!__\n(There is no time counter to know how long you lasted. This is for one sole reason...

It's always gratifying to finish a game, even if it's a piece of shit. In this case, lets face it, a HUMONGOUS piece of crap. I was definitely rusty both on unity and c# for this challenge. It took me a long time to get comfortable with the whole thing. After the first 6h it was clear to me that the game ideas was not good, and I was having to much trouble executing it. In summary, you are watching the remains of the battlefield between me and Unity's UI system...and I was massacred. I did learn a bunch so I won't hide in the basement to cry ;)\nPS: The € thing instead of $ is intended.\n\n__Some Notes for the future:__\n- I spent a lot of time reading the Unity Scripting API, UnityAnswers forum and StackOverflow to refresh a lot of things I already know. Next time do a 1 day intensive warm-up the week before or less intense during the whole week. \n\n## Tools\n- Unity 5.6\n- Audacity (for Sound)\n- Lunapic (for Graphics)\n- Bosca Ceoil (For the music)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Source Code](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t419vnv3ev4sdgh/EnergyTycoonSource.zip?dl=0)\n- [Win32](https://www.dropbox.com/s/medqephbxwi1we4/CoalGameWin.zip?dl=0)\n- [MacOS](https://www.dropbox.com/s/beueb2me9tbpc2u/CoalGameMac.app.zip?dl=0)\n- [Web](https://gris.itch.io/Coal-Game)\n\n## 48hours + Noob = Bugs\n\nI probably won't fix anything since I didn't like the idea or execution.

For example, hovering over the fuel tank will highlight FUEL and GENERATOR, because it affects both.\n\n - Source: https://github.com/mwcz/in-orange-light\n - Beepbox sounds: [generator](http://beepbox.co/#5s7k0l00e00t7m1a7g0vj7i1r1w81445111f30222000d11000101c00023000h40000000v20214050o3000b0h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4g8h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4i4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h0h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4gp21mkNVAWE6CCIdttddsB1x0055MSJoggMk23m00IT3ZkmNDwxzP86K267ao78eq10O7GwkOaGmgtkaGgw0abxL000)\n[generator empty](http://beepbox.co/#5s7k0l00e00t7m1a7g0vj7i1r1w81445111f30222000d11000101c00023000h40000000v20214050o3000b0h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4g8h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4y4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h0h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4gp21mkNVAWE6CCIdttddsB1x0055MSJoggMk23m00IT3ZkmNDwxzP86K267ao78eq10O7GwkOaGmgtkaGgw0abxL000)\n[heater](http://beepbox.co/#5s7k0l00e00t7m1a7g0vj7i1r1w81445111f30222000d11000101c00023000h40000000v20214050o3000b0h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h8h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h424h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h0h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4gp21mkNVAWE6CCIdttddsB1x0055MSJoggMk23m00IT3ZkmNDwxzP86K267ao78eq10O7GwkOaGmgtkaGgw0abxL000)\n[heater off](http://beepbox.co/#5s7k0l00e00t7m1a7g0vj7i1r1w81445111f30222000d11000101c00023000h40000000v20214050o3000b0h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4i8h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h424h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h0h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4gp21mkNVAWE6CCIdttddsB1x0055MSJoggMk23m00IT3ZkmNDwxzP86K267ao78eq10O7GwkOaGmgtkaGgw0abxL000)\n[hunger](http://beepbox.co/#5s7k0l00e00t7m1a7g0vj7i1r1w81445111f30222000d11000101c00023000h40000000v20214000o3000b0h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4g8h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h424h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4gp21mkNVAWE6CCIdttddsB1x0055MSJoggMk23m00IT3ZkmNDwxzP86K267ao78eq10O7GwkOaGmgtkaGgw0abxL000)\n[generator off](http://beepbox.co/#5s7k0l00e00t7m1a7g0vj7i1r1w81445111f30222000d11000101c00023000h40000000v00014050o3000b0h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4g8h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4O4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h0h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4gp21ykNVAWE6CCIdttddsB1x0055MSJoggMk23m00IT3ZkmNDwxzP86K267ao78eq10O7GwkOaGmgtkaGgHrNwgMiw2aEPw0EK6Y000)\n[refuel](http://beepbox.co/#5s7k0l00e00tbm1a7g0vj7i1r1w81445111f50222000d21000101c00023000h10000000v00214000o1000b8h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4g8h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h424h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h0h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4gp21ykNP2AXE6CCIdttddsB1xkX6MeCkY2pcM02yUrmI88oa11H00mrx-GboPMgNVA3n133Bc3A7d0wp3Rgap5lb8eG5l8g055MTw00)\n[nom](http://beepbox.co/#5s7k0l00e00tbm1a7g0vj7i1r1w81445111f50222000d21000101c00023000h10000000v00214000o1000b0h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4g8h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h424h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h8h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4h4gp21FkNXAX86CCIdttddsB1xkX60eCkY2pcM02yUrmI88oa11H00mrx-GboPMgNVA3n133Bc3A7d0wp3Rgap5lb8eG5l8g055MTBg2wA2Cju00)\n\n\n[beepbox]: http://beepbox.co\n[phaser]: http://phaser.io/\n[vim]: http://www.vim.org/\n[inkscape]: https://inkscape.org/en/\n[gimp]: https://www.gimp.org/","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//4e6/z/601e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/in-orange-light","author":{"name":"mwcz","uid":1764,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//4e6/z/2e0e.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/mwcz"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//4e6/z/601b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//4e6/z/601b.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://scripta.co/in-orange-light/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Down to the last Percents","category":"compo","description":"![Title.png](///raw/be3/2/z/6310.png)\nYou wake up in your room after some monsters have invaded your building and cut the power.

Your task is simple, survive as long as possible. But environment in this game is'nt much friendly. You must eat for hinder hunger, heat yourself for prevent freeze in cold night, and lastly defend yourself before zombies, who are wake up at night. Peace time (day) is limited, every day you must prepare for night, make some supplies for next deadly night.\n\n\n**How I make animation and player ?**\nAnswer is very simple, I make a very simple 3D model of player and weapons with sceleton, and create simple animations for it. Run throug Unity3D and bake these animations into sprites with weapons and wtihout them (there are around 200 sprites for this animations in sheet :) Thanx god for automate tools which helps me with converting from 3D to 2D sprite)\n\n\n# How to play ?\n\n- 1) You must watch your stats (power), if your heat or hunger go under 0, you will start dying.\n- 2) Day have 2 minutes, and every night (60 seconds), will come zombies in wave, there are also cold so you need warm with campfire and fight with zombies.\n- 3) For better weapons and tools you must mine stone and wood\n- 4) For decrease hunger, you need pick food from bushes and eat it\n- 5) Every tool and weapon can be upgraded, but you can carry only one so you must switch between them by click on specific item (not just buy it)\n\n# Controlls\n* Movement: [W][A][S][D] or arrow keys\n* Attack/mine: [SPACE_BAR]\n* Eat: Hit eat button\n* Buy item: Hit plus button on items\n* Switch item: Hit icon in inventory\n\n\n# Tools:\n**Axe**\n![axe.jpg](///raw/225/z/6676.jpg)\nBasic tool for quicker mine wood and stone, it can't be use for attack, you will attack as free hand.\n\n\n**Knife**\n![knife.jpg](///raw/225/z/6673.jpg)\n\nFirst attack weapon, power is poor, but you can survive few nights only with this knife.\n\n**Sword**\n![sword.jpg](///raw/225/z/6674.jpg)\nAdvanced weapon for mid game, without upgraded sword, you can't survive for more then 5 days. \n\n**Battle axe**\n![battleaxe.jpg](///raw/225/z/6675.jpg)\nThis weapon looks so cool, and it's also very powerfull, fully upgraded battle axe will destroy every zombie wave.\n\n# Out of time \n(48 hour is not much, but I not want submit in JAM):\n- More sounds (footsteps, zombie hit, zombie dead, player hit, campfire)\n- Whole tutorial \"room\"\n- More environment props (trunks, stones, flowers)\n- Thirst state, player must drink from well\n- Better balancing (item price, item damage, zombie wave and damage)\n\n**Bug fixes**\n- 31.7. 11:50 CET - Fixed very easy gameplay with cold, its almost not challanging (maybe it require more balancing for better difficulty) - https://github.com/hadikcz/LudumDare39_Last_survivor/commit/e19de07b9d195462a70fe4445292a360314f8a03\n- 1.8. 23:17 CET -  Double food bush count, for easy difficulty -\n https://github.com/hadikcz/LudumDare39_Last_survivor/commit/82feaeb148b2fadd02a2bf3268e03e8574dc0f3c\n\n\n## Screens and gameplay\n\n[Gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdfBUCN_kg)\n\n![screen.jpg](///raw/225/z/667d.jpg)\n\n![Screenshot_2.jpg](///raw/225/z/667e.jpg)\n\n![Screenshot_15.jpg](///raw/225/z/6680.jpg)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//225/z/6626.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/last-survivor","author":{"name":"Hadik","uid":1314,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/hadik"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//225/z/6694.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//225/z/6694.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//225/z/669e.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//225/z/669e.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//225/z/6676.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//225/z/6676.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//225/z/6673.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//225/z/6673.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//225/z/6674.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//225/z/6674.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//225/z/6675.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//225/z/6675.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//225/z/667d.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//225/z/667d.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//225/z/667e.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//225/z/667e.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//225/z/6680.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//225/z/6680.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://hadikcz.github.io/LudumDare39_Last_survivor/"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/hadikcz/LudumDare39_Last_survivor/"},{"label":"Document","url":"https://youtu.be/TIdfBUCN_kg"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Keyboard Commander","category":"compo","description":"![Screen2.jpg](///raw/75c/2/z/6194.jpg)\nWelcome to Keyboard Commander!\n\nControl the entire game from your keyboard.\n\nYou are launched into a small sector of space with a failing space station.

To do so, you must first get close enough that Earth is in range of the FTL drive.\nIn this case, that means you'll have to jump enough to traverse 80 lightyears. Then, Earth will show up when you use the Sensors room as a possible jump location.\n\n​Each jump requires the jump charge to be at least 3, and if it's only 3 or 4, a successful piloting check is necessary to avoid 2 hull damage. The next jump location can be chosen by using the Sensors room, otherwise it is randomly drawn from the top of the jump location deck.\n\n​Click on crew member meeples to select them, and then click on rooms to move and perform an action there. If a room is on fire, in the middle of a mutiny, or has alien invaders, you won't be able to use the system there until those problems are resolved first. Similarly, you can use a room while it's damaged, unless there are as many damages to the room as people it can hold.\n\n​Each location has a unique deck of crises to deal with from alien lifeforms attacking your crew, to hostile spaceships or explosions.\n\nTools used: Unity 2017.1, Photoshop, Inkscape, Bxfr, Audiotool\n\nBugfixes: Fixed bug where being able to shoot more enemies then there were would cause the game to freeze","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9a3/1/z/5f6c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/intrepid-1","author":{"name":"Arkthalohs","uid":5033,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/arkthalohs"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9a3/1/z/5f62.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9a3/1/z/5f62.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://arkthalohs.itch.io/intrepid"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://1drv.ms/u/s!AvN7AIwOlRnXivJIwZoJf8AWSLYa6g"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://bitbucket.org/Arkthalohs/ludum-dare-39/src"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"PP-Mate","category":"compo","description":"ROLL TO VICTORY, SMASH ENEMIES AND SUCK THE SWEET NECTAR OF POWER FROM THEIR EXPLODED BODIES.

Will you be able to retrieve the battery, or will you be stuck here forever?\n\n**=======================================**\n\nThis is a HTML5 compo entry for Ludum Dare which turned into quite a frustrating monster, both gameplay- and development-wise. If you DO manage to finish the game, let me know what your final score is! Even if you didn't, feel free to leave a comment, and I'll try out your game as well!\n\n**=======================================**\n\n**HOW TO PLAY + TIPS:**\n\n1. A battery must be plugged into the console before you can play!\n2. **The bouncing green circle charges batteries that it touches!**\n    - **It's best to drag a battery around to follow the green circle for maximum charging speed!**\n    - **For best results, do it while you're playing the game so the battery will be ready when you run out of power!**\n3. Press the power button to turn on the console!\n4. **The button on the left toggles the backlight, the one on the right toggles sound!**\n5. Having one toggled on doubles the battery's usage, tripled if both are on!\n6. AD to move, W to jump, **S to use your shield**!\n7. The shield makes you impervious to damage, but you are unable to move for half a second!\n8. Save points save your progress; make sure you touch them, or you'll have to do over!\n9.

Your dream is to save enough money for a ticket to Hawai.\n\n## Controls:\n|\nW,A,S,D - Movement\n\nE - Interact\n|\nMouse - Look Around\n\nShift - Sprint\n\n## Author's note:\nOnce again, I was mainly focusing on visuals, and I'm pretty happy with the results. Game has unfortunately no sfx and no music. There was just no time for it. I have managed to create 5 different quality settings, so you should be able to play this even on older machines. Game might be slightly unballanced as there was no real time for testing. Watch the gameplay video if you have trouble understanding the game. \n\n## Tips:\n- Buying 3-4 Fluffs should be enough\n- Fluffs regain energy in the enclosure, but only if there is food and water\n- More Fluffs in enclosure -> food and water are drained more rapidly\n- You can throw away empty boxes and Fluff Poop into garbage can\n- There are a lot of usefull items hidden in the factory\n- You can improve maximum energy of a Fluff, by putting it into training wheel.\n- Recharging fluffs works as shown on the first screenshot (put battery into recharge station and Fluff at the ned of the cable)\n\n## I hope you will enjoy the game. Cheers! \n\n![F1.png](///raw/2db/z/6237.png)\n\n![F2.png](///raw/2db/z/623a.png)\n\n![F3.png](///raw/2db/z/623e.png)\n\n------------------------- TIMELAPSE -------------------------\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XPa9Hjl9v4\n\n------------------------- GAMEPLAY -------------------------\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh2M4dOrGKE\n\nhttps://twitter.com/OndrejAngelovic\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2db/z/6241.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/fluff-factory-1","author":{"name":"Simple Ghost","uid":3026,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2db/z/6990.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/simple-ghost"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2db/z/6237.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2db/z/6237.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2db/z/623a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2db/z/623a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2db/z/623e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2db/z/623e.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://simpleghost.itch.io/fluff-factory"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Action Power Robot","category":"compo","description":"Use arrow keys to pick up coins.

You'll face a board of 5x5 light bulbs which you need to turn off in order to regain some energy as well as advance to the next level.\nBut be aware: toggling one lamp will toggle all adjacent ones as well as every lamp that is connected via a cable!\n\n![Screenshot.png](///raw/430/8/z/5ede.png)\n\nThis is my first solo LD entry and my goal was to get something to a finished state. I think I managed quite well, though I had to cut some features I wanted to implemented and also horribly failed at creating music.\n\n## Stuff Used\nThe font used is called \"Bradley Gratis\" and is available on 1001fonts.com.\n\nTools used: Unity Personal, Blender, Bosca Ceoil, Audacity.\n\n## How to play\nYou click a light to toggle its state. However doing that will also toggle the state of adjacent lights (all 8 neighbors). Your goal is to turn off all lights before your battery (shown at the bottom) runs out of power. Whenever your click turns off all lights, the box immediately turns on new lights for you to turn off but grants you additional battery charge for 5 more seconds! Good luck!\n\nYou can play in your browser on itch.io.\n(I originally wanted to create an Android build as well, but didn't have the module downloaded!)\n\n\n## Misc\nThe project folder can be downloaded below! Be warned, the project is really, really messy and none of the code is documented.

Fun fact, my game also fits in with LD31's theme.\n\n=== Description ===\nInspired by the Tropico series of games and that one episode of Miami Vice, you're in charge of a Caribbean island ruled by your communist dictatorship. Unfortunately, communism in the east is falling apart, and the people of your island have heard about it. They are getting restless, seeing that maybe your regime could be toppled too.\n\nYou must control your island's military and police forces, to fight off rebels and deal with protests, all while collecting money by \"borrowing\" from your nation's treasury by bribing bankers, or seizing the assets of islanders with police forces. Your power over your nation is constantly decreasing, however.\n\n\n=== Instructions ===\n1. Gather some initial funds by going into the police menu (in the side bar), and assigning some police forces to seize assets.\n2. Send armed units to patrol the forests (in brown) for rebels\n3. Move your dictator to banks, and bribe different bankers in order to make big money\n4. Slow down the decay of the power bar by purchasing media campaigns from the media menu (in the side bar)\n5. Send your police to deal with protests and riots, which cause your power bar to decrease faster\n6. When you've \"borrowed\" enough money to get a good score, go to the airport, and get a plane ready\n7. When you're ready, escape from your island!\n- To move a unit, click on it, then click where it needs to move, or on the icon it needs to deal with.\n- To change the effectiveness of police at dealing with protests and riots, change their tools in the police menu\n\n\n=== Tools used ===\n- Java Eclipse (Juno, it's on an old laptop)\n- Paint.NET\n- Evernote\n\n\n=== Features I planned but ran out of time for ===\n- Assassins\n- Military being able to take care of protests/riots\n- Escape the island on a cargo ship or fishing boat\n- MUSIC (again)\n- Police and Military rebelling when power is too low\n\n\nThank you for playing!","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2aa/1/z/639c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/island-of-revolution-1","author":{"name":"mikethewayne","uid":6818,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/mikethewayne"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/jo2z2mm40rpk9db/Island%20Of%20Revolution.rar?dl=0"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/jo2z2mm40rpk9db/Island%20Of%20Revolution.rar?dl=0"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/jf9p627c7umk1fw/Island%20of%20Revolution%20Source.rar?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Surge - LD39","category":"compo","description":"![gif.gif](///raw/bc8/z/8604.gif)\n## Description\nUse your energy fist thing to beat up power sucking skulls.\n\n## Instructions\n* ARROW KEYS to move\n* Z to use your fist\n* R to restart from last checkpoint\n* HINT: try hitting the rockets (well, white circles)\n\n#### Tools used\n* Framework: Love2d\n* Text editing: Atom\n* Graphics: Krita and ShoeBox\n* Audio: FL studio 12, LabChirp and Audacity\n* Map editing: Tiled\n\n#### Mac OSX and Linux\n* Download and install Love2d - https://love2d.org/\n* Download the .love file (labelled 'Other (platform)')\n* You should be able to launch the .love file with the love2d executable (however you normally do that on your platform :neutral_face: )","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//bc8/z/5e45.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/surge-ld39","author":{"name":"IcyLava","uid":2251,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/icylava"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//bc8/z/8604.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//bc8/z/8604.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/h92sibvgmv008u6/Surge%20-%20LD39%20%28win%29.zip?dl=1"},{"label":"Other","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/rrj8vb8itfzf0pc/Surge%20-%20LD39.love?dl=1"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"My Kingdom for a Rabbit!","category":"compo","description":"Queen Beatrix Silktail is the last of her line, and now the crown must be passed on, or else the rabbits return to being just mere animals.

After the first 24 hours I had something which I felt good about submitting to the jam, so in the last 24 hours I had time to add in all of things I usually don't get around to in a jam, like menus and tutorials.\n\nHope you all like it, looking forward to hearing your feedback!\n\nTools:\nUnity (Cinemachine, Standard Assets, TextMesh Pro), Blender, Audacity, WolframTones, Paint.net","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a47/z/5bac.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/windup-1","author":{"name":"kleinzach","uid":1866,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/kleinzach"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/ohh7njfsyf8yoqs/WindUp.zip?dl=0"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://kleinzach.itch.io/windup"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Shekateka","category":"compo","description":"A short dungeon crawler with a laser gun that can only be used when plugged to a socket.\n\nMade for Ludum Dare 39 in 48 hours.\n\nTheme was \"running out of power\".\n\nMade with Game Maker Studio\n\n![screen1.png](///raw/df6/z/65e5.png)\n\n![screen2.png](///raw/df6/z/65fa.png)\n\n![screen3.png](///raw/df6/z/65fb.png)\n\n![screen4.png](///raw/df6/z/65fc.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//df6/z/5f7f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/shekateka","author":{"name":"dietzribi","uid":1789,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//df6/z/2d32.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/dietzribi"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//df6/z/65e5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//df6/z/65e5.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//df6/z/65fa.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//df6/z/65fa.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//df6/z/65fb.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//df6/z/65fb.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//df6/z/65fc.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//df6/z/65fc.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://dietzribi.itch.io/shekateka"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Circlebots Share","category":"compo","description":"**Read the instructions on twitch.io** and [PLAY NOW](https://talrnu.itch.io/circlebots-share)!\n\n![circlebots-screenshot-pinwheel.png](///raw/b8c/z/7eee.png)\n\nGreen circlebots need blue energy, but they can't feed themselves.

This is done by clicking the button under region income with the cost text; 15, 100, 500... (Testing showed it was not clear this was a button. Thanks Max and Cecilie)\n* If a regions support is low, try lower the tax cut a lot. With time people will like you better.\n* The 4 advisors are earning special points. Use them to either upgrade their speciel skill, or to collect fundraisers. Fundraisers costs 5 special points, and will give cold cash in return. Remember advisors will only earn special points when certain criterias are met.\n* Keep an empty inbox. Your VP only earns points when you have no mails. Furthermore, people don´t like to wait to long for an answer.\n* Use the break right after an election to adjust taxes and upgrade advisors and regions.\n* You can click the text boxes under advisors to clear them, to better notice new messages.\n* Music! You can click the note button in the upper left corner to hear the Zorgan National Hymn!\n\nHave fun! How many years can you maintain the seat in the purple house of Zorga? Post your record in the comments! Thanks!\n\nHotfix: Through some testing I found a bug that would wrongfully vote against you. This is now fixed in the Hotfix update. I fixed some typos and added a helping arrow to show where to upgrade regions (income).\n* Fixed voting. Regions will now vote according to there own support status.\n* Fixed typos showing VP, SP, TP and WP text in Fundraisers.\n* Fixed guideline arrow to show how to upgrade regions, and thereby earn taxes.\n* Fixed mails that would give wrong result.\n\nFirst link is original.

As long as they are in the darkness, they are invisible to you. However, using your lamp's abilities will help to detect them and ultimately destroy them. Be careful, though, if they manage to sneak up on you they will drain your lamp's energy. When it runs out, the game is over.\n\n***\n\n### Instructions\nLamplight is a turn-based dungeon crawler on a hex grid. The objective is to clear as many rooms as you can before running out of lamp energy (which will happen sooner or later). Monsters are invisible until you use your lamp's abilities on them. Bright light will stun monsters, making them vulnerable. They also leave tracks as they move, allowing you to try to deduce where they are in the darkness. Follow the tutorial in the first room to learn the basics.\n\nThere isn't a ton of content in the game unfortunately, you'll see everything there is to see on a reasonable run. I feel like the concept was communicated quite well and turned out to be decently fun though.\n\n***\n\n### About\nThis is my second Ludum Dare. Last time I submitted a \"jam\" game. I had plenty of time and managed to finish quite early, so this time I thought I'd go ahead and do \"compo\". It was definitely much more of a struggle, I don't think I had as solid of an idea as I did last time, and shaving that extra day off really does a number psychologically. I definitely wasn't able to execute all the ideas I had, and I wish I could have squeezed in one or two more enemies at least. It was a great experience, though, and I managed to at least finish a playable product!\n\n***\n\n### Tools Used\n- Game Maker: Studio 1.4\n- Bfxr (sound effects)\n- JamStudio.com (music)\n- Audacity (sound + music editing)\n- MS Paint (doodles that pass as graphics)\n\nAll assets are original, as per compo rules.\n\n***\n\n### Post-Submission Changes\n- v1.01 - Fixed a subtle bug I found *right after* I submitted.\n- v1.02 - Added android support.\n- v1.03 - On Windows made the game window resizable (some players with high-res monitors were having a hard time playing the game).\n- V1.03YYC - Re-compiled Windows and Android to run natively (GM's Yo-Yo Compiler) for optimization boosts (didn't really need it, but it might be nice for some mobile users). Also got a build working for Linux.\n- Got a web build up and running! Took some finagling, but I think it was worth it for the much easier access.\n\n***\n\n![android_art.png](///raw/91b/3/z/80dd.png)\nIf you're up for it, try it on Android! I think Lamplight feels really good on mobile.\n\n***\n\n**Note:** The HTML5 version requires WebGL, not all browsers support this. Also if you have an ultra-wide or 4K display, it might be more comfortable to use a non-web version so you can scale the game window up.\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//91b/3/z/626c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/lamplight","author":{"name":"Wheffle","uid":15129,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//91b/3/z/2caf.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/wheffle"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//91b/3/z/5e95.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//91b/3/z/5e95.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//91b/3/z/5ea1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//91b/3/z/5ea1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//91b/3/z/80de.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//91b/3/z/80de.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//91b/3/z/80dd.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//91b/3/z/80dd.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://wheffle.itch.io/lamplight"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/76g6jig4bo8u59c/Lamplight-1.03YYC-win.zip?dl=1"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/6a12av22ilasm2z/Lamplight-1.03YYC-linux.zip?dl=1"},{"label":"Android","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/u642pjl5sr7fgue/Lamplight-1.03YYC-android.apk?dl=1"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://bitbucket.org/Wheffle/robotwizard/src"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","linux","mobile"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Pylon Defense","category":"compo","description":"![Pylon_Defense_Cover.PNG](///raw/747/3/z/72ca.png)\n\nWelcome to your new job at the Department of Pylon Defense!

The eight crew members are on a journey through space, but their ship's core can only produce enough power to run the cryostasis modules. In order to reach their destination, they must make use of their stored reserves of power to run the life support and other ship systems in order to defend against threats like stellar storms and radiation fields.\n\nThere's no music, but consider playing this in the background: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mHf0cKPU5g\n\n![numbers.png](///raw/30d/2/z/5f0c.png)\n\n1. Progress bar\n2. Crew member name, job, and health status\n3. Crew member position assignment\n4. Freeze/thaw crew member (only in Cryo Control)\n5. Current power reserves\n6. Rate of power loss\n7. Proportion of engine speed to power usage, both current and required average to make it to the end\n8. Usage statistics for all ship positions\n9. Ship's log: progress updates appear green, crisis events appear red, and horse revolutions appear yellow\n\n## Ship positions\n* **Cryo Control:** Any crew member can place themselves in cryostasis, but an active crew member must man Cryo Control to thaw frozen crew members. Crew members in cryostasis take less power to keep alive.\n* **Engine Room:** Man the Engine Room to increase the _Indefatigable_'s speed. Each additional crew member makes the ship faster and more efficient in its power usage.\n* **Life Support:** Man Life Support to decrease the power usage per active crew member.\n* **Medical Bay:** Man the Medical Bay with a healthy crew member to heal an injured crew member in the Medical bay. Injured crew members will worsen and eventually die outside the Medical Bay.\n* **Missile Control:** Man Missile Control to destroy hostile fighters attacking the ship.\n* **Scanner Array:** Man the Scanner Array to increase the range at which oncoming crises are detected.\n* **Shield Gens:** Man the Shield Gens to decrease the damage taken from stellar storms.\n* **Warp Control:** Man Warp Control to build warp charge. When the warp charge is full, the _Indefatigable_ can jump forward to skip past crises. When nobody is manning warp control, warp charge will decay, so watch out!\n\n## Crises\n\n* **Stellar storm:** A storm hits the _Indefatigable_, costing power to maintain the shields. Each crew member manning Shield Gens reduces the power loss.\n* **Radiation field:** Radiation hits up to three ship positions, injuring any crew members there. Each crew member manning Life Support reduces the number of positions hit.\n* **Hostile fighters:** Hostile fighters attack the _Indefatigable_, costing energy to fend off. Any hostiles that aren't destroyed will return and attack again. Each crew member manning Missile Control destroys hostile fighters when they attack.\n* **Heat wave:** A heat wave disrupts the cryostasis modules, killing any crew members in cryostasis.\n* **Spatial flux:** Spacetime anomalies require warp charge to weather. The _Indefatigable_ is destroyed unless Warp Control is manned with at least 15% warp charge.

If you are brave enough to try it with a graphical tablet, please tell me how it went! The controls are kind-of inspired by Dota 2, but right-click for attack does not work, so do not try that. :)\n\n* **ESC** - Quit game\n* **Right Mouse Button** - Move\n* **Left Mouse Button** - Select Target for Spell\n* **Q** - Activate Fireball\n* **W** - Activate Burning Vision\n* **E** - Activate Teleport\n* **R** - Activate Ring of Fire\n* **Enter/Return** - Restart Game or Skip Tutorial\n\n## Development\n\nThis is my first Ludum Dare I did completly alone, and third Ludum Dare in total. I have created the game completly by myself, using only assets I have created during the weekend. The only exception are the animations which were created using Mixamo.\n\nThe software used to create the game and assets was as follows:\n\n* Unity 2017.1\n* MagicaVoxel\n* Paint.NET\n* Bxfr\n* Boscaceoil\n\nVersions for other platforms are coming soon. WebGL version will probably not be available, unless there is serious demand.

The city will grow depending on how well you keep it powered.\n\nDon't grow too quickly though, as the city mayor won't tolerate many power outages before terminating your contract.\n\n**Instructions and tips:**\n- Build your first power plant away from the starting city block. Citizens dislike living close to power plants, substations and high voltage nodes.\n- Connect your power plant to a substation with high voltage lines. The substation lowers the voltage to residential values.\n- Connect the substation to the residential areas using low voltage lines, people don't mind these near their houses.\n- The city will grow into new blocks and upgrade existing ones much faster into well powered and valued areas.\n- The city won't tolerate three power outages in a single month.\n- Don't grow your grid too fast at the start of the game, or else the city power demand will get unmanageable quickly.\n- If you pollute too much, the city will start imposing penalties by taxing your income.\n- Base price per kWh varies each month, by external factors you cannot control.\n- You can see the currently powered zones by using the \"POWER\" button on the left.\n\n**​Missing features (maybe I'll implement them post-jam):**\n- More important than anything else: **Balance**. I didn't have enough time to better playtest the game and set enjoyable costs, rates, and other values.​\n- ​Saving and loading games. Also very important as games can get long.\n- Info on city buildings (how much each kind consumes, etc.).\n- Random events and offers. These should affect the kWh price, grow rate, and any other variable.\n- Not programmer art.\n- Music. For now get on Youtube and search for an Instrumental Jazz playlist to play while you play the game.\n\nI'm pretty happy with results even with the missing features. Maybe I'll turn this into a complete game after the jam.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//fa9/z/5da7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/electric-energy-tycoon","author":{"name":"Jesús González","uid":2479,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//fa9/z/49f1.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/jesus-gonzalez"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//fa9/z/6555.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//fa9/z/6555.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://jesusgonzalez.itch.io/eet"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Lunar Lander","category":"compo","description":"![ScreenShot01.PNG](///raw/81d/9/z/5e12.png)\n\nA Game where you try to land on the MOON!

The game is mobile-friendly, and should work on Android and iPhone. Just visit the above link and use the on-screen buttons in the bottom corners to rotate the snake.\n\nNote that the view is top-down and the rotation is relative to the snake. So if the snake is going down and you turn left, the snake is now going right. If the snake is going right and you turn left, the snake is now going up.\n\nOn a real keyboard, just use the arrow keys.\n\n**Do the snakes interact?**\n\nNo. This is more of a fun (?) visualization than it is a game. I wanted to see what it looks like when you overlay 100+ games of snake on each other.\n\n**Food spawned on my snake!**\n\nThat's not a bug. Every user is shown the same sequence of food locations, so the snakes are all chasing the same thing. That means the food can spawn on top of your snake.\n\n**This game doesn't have sounds!**\n\nListen to this while you play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P_gmUCmMP4\n\nWhen you're sick of that, you'll be thanking me for not putting it in the game.\n\n**What does this have to do with the theme?**\n\nOh right. Umm. Maybe instead of snakes, they're, like, electrons... and instead of food, it's protons? Yeah let's go with that.\n\n**What did you use to make the game?**\n\nI used [P5.js](https://p5js.org/reference/) for the game, and a basic Java servlet to store the data in a database.\n\n**Can I view the source?**\n\nSure. It's just one HTML file with embedded JavaScript.

You've been seemingly abandoned by your owners, and you're nearing the end of your power source. The only options you have left is leave your storage room in search of power, or shut down for good...

One person has had issues getting the game started too, he had to fiddle around a little bit before it worked. So, I believe there are some underlying issues with the build that were somehow ignored when packaging for windows 64. If the game doesn't work for you at first, try again another day and it might work. I think it might be caching issues, so refreshing the memory with a reboot or just the passing of time could be the key.\n\n### Additional Screenshots\n![Screenshot 2017-07-31 01.36.17.png](///raw/e32/3/z/5cfc.png)\n![Screenshot 2017-07-31 01.36.52.png](///raw/e32/3/z/5d00.png)\n![Screenshot 2017-07-31 01.37.05.png](///raw/e32/3/z/5d12.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e32/3/z/5d3b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/robby-goes-rogue","author":{"name":"Mars","uid":12862,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e32/3/z/34d8.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/mars"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e32/3/z/5d3b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e32/3/z/5d3b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e32/3/z/5cfc.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e32/3/z/5cfc.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e32/3/z/5d00.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e32/3/z/5d00.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e32/3/z/5d12.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e32/3/z/5d12.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://gitlab.com/MarsAstro/dying-machine"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://marsastro.itch.io/robby-goes-rogue"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Very Fast Robot Rolling at High Speed","category":"compo","description":"You play as a small wheel robot with an very short battery life.

It is supposed to be more on the educational and relatable side of things.\n\n   The premise is that in the year 20017, Nuclear Power is the only way the world is equipped to sustain itself, but the reactors have almost all completely run out of Uranium. Luckily they can calculate the exact location of a huge deposit of Uranium, but with barely any electrical power, they are forced to calculate it by hand. But since most of the globe's population is uneducated and preoccupied with living their \"socially acceptable\" lives, a group of intellectuals create the ultimate supercomputer. Instead of using electricity and computers, they instead use human brains! They create a game for you and everyone else on earth where you simply add numbers between 2 and 15 within the time limit. Should be easy.\n\n  The catch is, every number is written in Binary.\n\n  Tip:\n- Don't try to convert the numbers into Base 10. Use AND/OR gates in your brain to calculate it instead (Just like real microprocessors). If you are super nerdy like me or have no clue as to what I just said and have 18 minutes to spare: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNuPy-r1GuQ&t=167s (see example as well)\n\n  I hope this game is fun (it is for me but I am a geek like none other) and I hope that you can appreciate the insane amount of processing your computer does all the time. I estimate that a phone's processor could beat this game on the hardest difficulty and with the most number of rounds before a single frame is shown.\n\nFOR MAC USERS:\n  Sorry I was unable to export a Mac Version from processing. But you may be able to download one of the other versions and as long as you have Java 8 installed it will likely work.\n\n An example:\nIn case some of you don't know how to add in binary or care to look it up I've included an example in a text document in the folder with the download files.\n\nMade using Proccessing 3.3.3 and Adobe Photoshop (latest version)\n\nI opted out of audio because, well, I couldn't figure out how to make it work so I don't have any...\n\nAnd finally, for those who are supergeeks like me, there are a handful of easter eggs (particularly with the difficulty names) that if you do some math and Binary conversion you can get a kick out of it hopefully.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//eaa/8/z/5d6c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/binary-computing-1","author":{"name":"Draloric","uid":35502,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/draloric"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8Rs8A5hlOImNFZQdTBNUU5ObFE"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8Rs8A5hlOImNFZQdTBNUU5ObFE"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"The Last Light","category":"compo","description":"![TheLastLight2.gif](///raw/98c/2/z/5d17.gif)\n\n# Instruction\n\nA small game about a dark world where the last light is about to die.

Just a few hours before landing on earth the crew of the *Tolerance* realised two robots escaped from the jovian base they just left and hide amidst them. It is vital the crew discovers who the robots are before landing but their efforts are hindered by malfunctions in the oxygen module and they need to maintain it regularly.\n\nPlaytested with 8 players **Everybody breathes** is still enjoyable with more or less but don’t hesitate to tweak the rules accordingly. So grab you printer, a pair of scissors and embark for an epic mission on the *Tolerance* !\n\n\n# Rules Overview\n\nIn **Everybody breathes**, players must discovers who are the robots among them and put them in jail before the *Tolerance* lands on Earth. If the robots are free when the *Tolerance* lands or if the oxygen level in one room reaches 0, the robots wins.\n\nAt the beginning of the game each player receives an envelope containing their role ( human or robot ).\n\nEach turn is divided in two phases : Moving and working.\nDuring the moving phase, one by one, players can move to an adjacent room or stay in the room in which they currently are. \n\nAt the end of this phase, each room of the spaceship looses two oxygen units.\n\nAfter that, one by one, players decide what to do during their working phase. They can either do some maintenance ( hoping to replenish the room oxygen level ) or analyze players in the room ( and possibly discover if there's a robot in the room ).\n\nAt the end of a turn the turn marker is incremented by one. If it was already on six, the game is over, players reveal their role cards and if both robots are in prison, the *Tolerance* crew wins.\n\n### Post Compo tests and tweaks\n\nI playtested the game with 7 players ( 6 humans and only one robot) with minor rules changes that could lead to a more intense game :\n* The game only lasts 5 turns\n* Everybody starts in the break room\n* The oxygen level of a room reaching 0 is not an instant win for robots. It has to be 0 at the beginning of the next turn for them to win. This leaves a last chance for humans to restore a decent oxygen level before suffocating.\n\n# Files\n\nDetailed Rules : https://github.com/KerDelos/Everybody-Breathes/raw/master/EverybodyBreathes_Rules.pdf\nPrint and Play Game : https://github.com/KerDelos/Everybody-Breathes/raw/master/EverybodyBreathes_PNP_Game.pdf\n\n# Credits\n\nGame design : KerDelos\n\nI also wish to thank all the wonderful fellow jammer that helped me test and iterate on the game design.\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//216/z/5d7f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/everybody-breathes-board-game-1","author":{"name":"Kerdelos","uid":1554,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/kerdelos"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"PDF","url":"https://github.com/KerDelos/Everybody-Breathes/raw/master/EverybodyBreathes_Rules.pdf"},{"label":"PDF","url":"https://github.com/KerDelos/Everybody-Breathes/raw/master/EverybodyBreathes_PNP_Game.pdf"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Lead","category":"compo","description":"![screen2.png](///raw/bb8/z/685c.png)\n\nLead (L.E.A.D.) - Legacy Electro-Anarchy Demolition!\n\nDestroy the enemies via electrification (yes, that's a real word).

Playing time is around 5-15 minutes.\nThere are only 2 resources in this game:\n\n- Metal\n- Energy\n\nBoth can be obtained from the (many) asteroids that you can find around the base.\nThis game cannot be \"win\", at some point you will either be overwhelmed by the enemies or you will run out of resources to extract.\nThe objective of the game is to gather as much metal as possible, while not dying under the pressure of the enemies.\n\n## Online scores\nYour score will be submitted to a database, in which you'll be able to compare with the rest of the players.\nThe server was coded during ludum dare and is currently hosted at my home, so it could go offline some times :smile:.\n\n\n# Important\n- Start by building METAL extractor, as if you run out of it, you cannot build extractors anymore \n  (yes, it would need a good rebalance, but I didn't know how to fix it without setting the cost to 0 (suggestions are welcome!). TL;DR: **Don't run out of metal or you'll not be able to build anything else**.\n- When you run out of energy for too long you will still lose the game. There's no visual indication of this! If you don't hear turrets shooting then you have a problem with energy.\n- You need to be paying attention closely to the energy level (or the amount of energy asteroids you are mining, when you are later in the game), as without energy the turrets cannot shoot...\n\n### Tips\n- Resources run out, you need to expand to stay alive, but expanding also increases your defenses requirements...\n- Enemy kills count towards the score.\n- if you use the same name your score will be REPLACED with the new one. You may go forward in the ladder, but you may also go back and worsen your score.\n- the map is generated randomly (even though the number of asteroids is the same). You could find a map easier than another.\n- The enemies are not intelligent at all, they just attack the nearest structure. They plan to win by overwhelming you with sheer numbers!\n- Pay attention to enemy formations. At late stage their numbers become dangerous!\n\n### Original ideas that I didn't implement due time constraints:\n- Originally I wanted this game to have a power network like creeper world (look it up! It's an excellent game!) and a more interesting distribution of the asteroids (a bit more clustered - to force the player putting weak spots /links between the clusters), but there was really no time to get it up in time.\n- I also wanted some more variety both in structures and enemies, but I already found it a bit challenging to reach an acceptable balance with the only enemy that is there, so adding more was out of the question.\n\n# Update: Web version, Mac & Linux\nAdded web version, mac and linux versions here: https://supercrunchy.itch.io/the-infinite-mine\n\nWe still ** highly reccomend using the native version**\n\nHere are few disadvantages of the web version:\n- It's not able to post the scores to the web server due to CORS being disable on the server (for the moment - until I enable it)\n- It runs very slowly, especially when the enemy starts getting up to some big numbers.\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//477/8/z/5cf4.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/the-infinite-mine","author":{"name":"SuperCrunchy","uid":34676,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/supercrunchy"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//477/8/z/5bc7.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//477/8/z/5bc7.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://bitbucket.org/danicampa90/ld39"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://supercrunchy.itch.io/the-infinite-mine"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://supercrunchy.itch.io/the-infinite-mine"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://supercrunchy.itch.io/the-infinite-mine"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://supercrunchy.itch.io/the-infinite-mine"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Star Power","category":"compo","description":"![screenshot_starpower.png](///raw/d3e/z/80da.png)\n\n***Star Power: A turn-based card game with physics and lasers!***\n\nYour star ship is stranded in the middle of a dense asteroid field.

Consider holding on to those a bit longer.\n* Avoid asteroids, and especially enemy drones, which attack you! Enemy drones can be destroyed with one laser shot.\n* Remember to save a Stabilizer action for when you are traveling at high speed - or to prevent knock back from enemy fire or asteroid collisions.\n* Don't shoot the power-ups! They give you a large power boost when you collide with them.\n* You start right in the center of the asteroid field, and you can fly any direction you want to escape.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d3e/z/5d38.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/star-power-1","author":{"name":"Simon Millard","uid":3645,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/simon-millard"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d3e/z/80da.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d3e/z/80da.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://frostwolfstudios.com/starpower/"},{"label":"Source code","url":"http://frostwolfstudios.com/starpowersource/RunningOutOfPower.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"MotherBoard","category":"compo","description":"​![Cover.jpg](///raw/5b4/3/z/5d68.jpg)\n\nYour phone is low on charge, and the charger is ten feet away!

You are in a frenzy to try to fix it, and when all appears to be hopeless, you remember that your electrician friend is just on the other side of town!  You embark on your quest in your sleepy haze.  However, from all these restless hours of coding, your body has started to shut down on you and try to make you sleep.  In order to make it across town, you must take periodic naps to maintain your will to go on (your willpower).

To try and point out that you CAN in fact beat a level, I added a blinking arrow when you get near the exit. I also gave Harry some stuff to say so that it is clear that this is a game and not just an engine demo.\n\nLastly, I am trying to address the difficulty. I altered the RNG so that more mushrooms will appear on tough maps. Also, I added a super jump for when you need to jump far - this uses up food though.\n\n--edit 2: After reading the official rules for Ludum Dare, I removed the super-jump that I just added. My level generator was generating jups that were too far to make without any powerups, so i thought it would be clever to have a super-jump to make them. However, this is too much of a new feature, so i removed it. I DID fix my generator, so that jumps that look too far should now have a ladder - this was originally intended but the ladder did not actually extend farther than the hole it was coming from, making the jump impossible. I kept some of the text in, since this clarifies that the game CAN be beaten.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c5a/9/z/5d46.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/hungry-harrys-climb","author":{"name":"PBG","uid":39516,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c5a/9/z/69fd.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/pbg"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c5a/9/z/5d4b.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c5a/9/z/5d4b.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=42933&tid=29735"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Moon Base Disaster","category":"compo","description":"![FirstImage.png](///raw/e1a/1/z/5d24.png)\n\n**Moon Base Disaster** - the title says it all...

No human lifesigns for lightyears, but an automated message was picked up that states there is a stargate several light-years away to take you to the last bastion of human civilisation - Utopia!\n\nBut your ship is low on power and you're hungry and everything's really horrible. Can you scavenge enough supplies to reach the stargate before you die/run out of power/starve? Probably not! But good luck anyway!\n\nIt's a basic Roguelike where you have to scavenge derelict stations for supplies and avoid alien creatures. At any time you can enter your ship and take off to the next set of destinations, but this costs power, which must be salvaged from the stations.  More distant stations tend to offer bigger rewards, but more risk and more power cost to reach. \n\n\nControls:\n- Arrows: Move char, select destination\n- Z: Interact (pickup thing, enter ship, confirm destination)\n- X: Cancel (close destination screen)\n\nHints:\n- Blobs and Hackwings will ignore you so long as you stay out their way\n- Solar Farms have a tonne of power to loot.\n- Find upgrades for your equipment quickly! Military Bases always have Weapons or Armor, but also have short range turret defences on site. \n- If you use health kits at full health, you'll increase your max health!\n- Don't starve! Habitats often have frequent food, otherwise you'll have to hunt monsters!\n- Weapons in order of power are: Fists, Crowbar, PBlade, Pistol, Rifle\n- Armor in order of strength are: Suit, Lt.

I've played this in 4 different browsers in 3 different operating systems, and it appears to behave as I'm expecting.  If you experience something odd, please describe in as much detail as you can what you feel is wrong and I will see what I can do to address it in the evolution build.\n\n### YouTube Demo\nCreated this video to show gameplay and maybe get feedback on performance vs. what others are seeing.\n#### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Eaf8ACdPgc\n\n### Known issues:\n- Enemy ships spawn randomly inside the game field, which results in unavoidable collisions some times.\n- Random seed isn't random yet.\n- Physics engine has an issue when exported to HTML5 as best I can tell.  Had to reduce thrust to very low levels to make it playable in web interface, which makes it too slow to be viable in CTF.\n- If you shoot at overlapping enemies, one of the dropped energy pods scales wrong and is stuck in one spot\n\n### Roadmap for the future:\n- Add additional power-ups.\n- Improve enemy logic (enemies avoid colliding with each other, ie: no overlap)\n- Add tractor beam to collect energy pods rather than colliding with them.\n- Add music\n- Add animations (engines, ships exploding, maybe slight parallax in the background)\n- Power bar on ship?\n- Score breakdown on game over screen\n- Add additional enemies (tougher enemies)\n- Add enemy combat functions (shooting, mines, etc)\n- Possibly convert the game to a panning view rather than a static screen with warping\n- Add a mobile port\n- ???\n\n### 2 August 2017 Notes\nThank you everyone for the amazing feedback.  It's really great to hear the suggestions and comments.  Ironically, many of the suggestions being made are things I already have planned for the game but just didn't have time to get done during the Compo.  I have already started adding a few things which you can find at the link below.  The main HTML5 (Web) link at the bottom is still the one to use for rating the game.

Although a centillion years is quite a good run for a universe, there is yet another law of nature that states, “Life always seeks a way keep on living.” This is evident in the evolution of a species over time. Animals adapt to rapid, dramatic environmental changes; Plants always eventually find their way through cracks in the concrete, despite all odds.\n\nEven so, by now, most of the sentient life has died out. Their stars over time have burned up all of their helium, and collapsed into grand displays of supernovae. All that remains are densely-packed neutron stars and foreboding black holes dotting the otherwise vacant landscape.\n\nThe younger and less intelligent races were the first to go, not having yet discovered the technology to reach out to neighboring star systems. Those who had failed to master the art of sustained nuclear fusion soon followed. Eventually, the most advanced races became desperate for power, forsaking peace agreements with more vulnerable populations to absorb their resources in a desperate attempt at self-preservation.\n\n\nWar now ravages the universe, as the most technologically advanced species’ gamble their final energy supplies in an attempt to strip each other of what few resources remain.\n\n**Life is tenacious.** \n\nThe Sakari of the Aneurin system, especially so. A highly technologically advanced and predominantly peaceful race, they had long-since predicted this outcome. Instead of waging war, they opted to close their borders and direct their energy into bolstering their defenses in an attempt to protect that which is most precious to them - The Trans-Universal Warp Drive, a device that will allow them to explore the multiverse. \n\nDevelopment has almost concluded, but unfortunately not quickly enough. The Sakari have used up the majority of their reserves trying to safely sustain their population, leaving nothing to spare to power the device, the last hope of the universe. With no other options left, they installed the drive onto their most capable ship, The Starseeker, and sent it off into the unknown.\n\nThe fate of Sakari, of the universe itself, rests in the collective hands of the crew of The Starseeker. They must acquire enough resources to power the warp drive, or else perish, and with them, the remaining life in the universe.\n\n### You, the Captain of The Starseeker, are in charge of this vital mission.\n### :star: Best of luck! :star:\n\n#### Music: Scorched Circuits - [Back To Root](https://backtoroot.bandcamp.com/album/140-or-less)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//dea/a/z/65a0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/aphelion","author":{"name":"vulpineblazeyt","uid":6201,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/vulpineblazeyt"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//dea/a/z/659c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//dea/a/z/659c.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://jonathangiacomelli.spacetechnology.net/ld39"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Energy Juice","category":"compo","description":"![4.PNG](///raw/1f/z/5b8b.png)\n\n**-Story-**\n\nThis is not a normal game!\nThis could literally kill you if you're not capable of handling the power and high-stress levels!\n\nI have warned you!\n\nWelcome to Energy Juice!\nNow after you have read all the warning text above I can finally tell you how this game works.\nReady?\nOkay, you press keys.\n\nHard? yes..

Lucky your finger can extrude enough force to press it down. \nAnd of course, we can harvest this force by small 'Energy harvesters' under your keycaps. The game is made to runs on this force and so the only way for you to win is to simply collect enough energy and you do so by pressing the right key.

The aim is to delete files on your computer, so you can last longer, and thus gain more points. Though sooner or later you'll meet your inevitable doom, no matter how hard you try. You can tweet your score at me though. \n\n**Quick Note:** This game doesn't touch your files, all deleting has to be done by the user through your file browser. \n\nDue to some limitations in unity, I decided to only create a windows version. \nCheck the ReadMe for controls. \n\nThe game is completely silent, with the exception of an alarm that goes of when there's less than 60 energy left, so you can safely run it in the background and just make sure to listen for the sound of an alarm.\n\nNOTE: Keep in mind that creating files will make your energy go down the same amount as if you delete a file, so since windows and programs like to do stuff in the background, you may experience sudden drops of energy if you aren't careful with background processes.

That may not have been the best idea as I was making level content for it right up until an hour before I submitted it, and that last hour was taken up by making the intro music.\n\nI usually spend the last half a day making music for LD games, so this was a fumble on my part.\n\nAs such I recommend you listen to your own music while playing. I recommend anything by AC/DC, any power-metal, RCHP's 'Zephyr Song', Rocketman, Let's Go fly a kite... \n\nThere does appear to be a bug on the WebGL version where the jetpack exhaust doesn't stop when you enter a 2-tile high corridor. The ability itself stops (so you're not wasting any fuel) but the graphic doesn't. This only happens on the WebGL version and I only noticed it after publishing and didn't have time to fix it. it doesn't appear to happen on the Windows version, so if it gets annoying try the download link.\n\n## Development Videos\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX82jPFES0c\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBDZL0RsR4g\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP0XdVkCzW4\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//814/z/5ba6.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/jetpack-june-and-the-tower-of-power","author":{"name":"geeitsomelaldy","uid":1048,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//814/z/2f67.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/geeitsomelaldy"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://geeitsomelaldy.itch.io/jetpack-june-and-the-tower-of-power"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://geeitsomelaldy.itch.io/jetpack-june-and-the-tower-of-power"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Pepe, The Power Plant","category":"jam","description":"![port.png](///raw/02a/9/z/5b80.png)\n\nA \"green\", 2D platformer!

Gardens take a lot of upkeep, so hop to it!\n\n![PICO-8_6.gif](///raw/658/8/z/879c.gif)\n\nStar flowers must be watered frequently if you want them to produce stars.

Wilted flowers don't produce stars at all. \n\n![PICO-8_8.gif](///raw/658/8/z/879f.gif)\n\nYou can also release an electric charge by pressing x when you are full of water. Lightning is dangerous for flowers but if you can hit the battery, the battery will receive a charge. Remember, the game ends when the battery runs out of charge, so make sure to zap it with lightning as often as you can.\n\n![PICO-8_9.gif](///raw/658/8/z/879e.gif)\n\nOccasionally, missiles will fall from the sky, directly at your battery. Water power has no effect on missiles, so charge up with wind power instead! When charged, press z to turn your cloud into a magnet and pull the missile away from your battery. Don't get too close to the battery though, as the magnet might drain  your battery!\n\n![PICO-8_7.gif](///raw/658/8/z/879d.gif)\n\nChompers are ravenous creatures, hungry for the taste of flowers. Press x when you're full of wind power to push chompers away from your fields. Be wary though, as if you're charged up on water, you might drop some lightning on your plants by accident! Lightning has no effect on chompers, since they have thick, nearly indestructible hides.!","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//658/8/z/5b6a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/cloud-game-early-build","author":{"name":"eggnog","uid":34902,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//658/8/z/87c4.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/eggnog"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//658/8/z/879b.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//658/8/z/879b.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//658/8/z/87a0.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//658/8/z/87a0.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//658/8/z/879c.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//658/8/z/879c.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//658/8/z/879f.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//658/8/z/879f.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//658/8/z/879e.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//658/8/z/879e.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//658/8/z/879d.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//658/8/z/879d.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://eggnog.itch.io/gusty-garden-early-build"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Skelly Zone","category":"compo","description":"Skelly Zone is a third person tower defense-ish game made for Ludum Dare 39 by Matt Mirrorfish.\n\nCollect skulls to build turrets, teleporters, cauldrons and barriers.\n\nShoot with left click.

Me neither, but never the less, now you can. In *Politics Rome* you take over the role of the newly empowered ruler of Rome at the end of the republic.\n\nPolitics Rome is a short strategy game in which you play as a newly elected politician.  You now have to please the public and boost your popularity to stay in power.\n\nIn Politics Rome you can\n\n* Establish laws\n* Declare wars.\n* Talk to people.\n* Talk to the merchant in the back-left corner\n* Ruin the country\n* Become broke\n* Die of age\n* Die of execution\n* Die of execution after a revolution\n* Die of execution after you lost the war\n* Die of execution after you demanded taxes without giving something back to the people\n* Rise to the stars as a good statesman (A reference to Scipio's Dream in Ciceros \"De re publica\")\n* Rise to the stars as a statesman who did nothing for 3.4 minutes\n* Rise to the stars as a dictator who died of age.\n\nBesides this the goal is uncertain. Just as in real politics there is no clear goal. But like most politicians try to also do something good for the people you can try to maximize your popularity score or try to stay in power as long as possible.\n\n##How to play\n![Screenshot3.PNG](///raw/893/8/z/686d.png)\n\nThe screenshot above shows how the game looks most of the time.\n\n1. If you hover over a law, this field will show what it would cost to establish the corresponding law.\n2. If you hover over a law, this will show how your popularity will change when this law would be established.\n3. If you hover over a law, this will show how much money you will gain monthly when this law would be activated.\n4. If you hover over a law, this will show how much money you will lose monthly when this law would be activated.\n5. If you hover over a law, this will show how your popularity will change monthly because of this law when this law would be activated.\n6. If you hover over a law, this textarea will tell you what this law would do.\n7. These fields show how your states will change when the month ends.\n8. This is your character\n9. This UI-Element shows how much time is left until the end of the month and how long the game is already running.\n10. These fields show your current stats.\n\n### Tip:\n\nIn the Roman republic, you could only be consul ones and only for 2 (/4) years. To stay in power longer there had to be some type of war going on. So if you want to stay in power longer than the regular 24 month you have to have the War-law activated.\n\n## Finishing\n\nI had much fun creating this game and I hope you have at least some while playing.

How long can you hold out?\n\n*INSTRUCTIONS FOR PLAY* (also listed in game):\n- Press they key on your keyboard that is displayed under the house to refill its \"power meter\"\n- If a house gets a locked symbol on it, it has tripped a breaker and you must reset the correct one by clicking on the red or blue switch in the lower right\n- Occasionally, your key will break after pressing it.  You must click on it to fix it, or just go without that one key until you need it.\n- You lose when any three houses loose power entirely and become abandoned.\n\nBe sure to post your scores below!  My best score was 20,090.  How high can you get?\n\n*POST-COMPO CHANGE LOG*\nAugust, 03rd, 2017:\n- Restricted required keys to alphanumeric keys.  This should hopefully fix most issues around incompatibilities with a variety of keyboard layouts.\n- Increased number of starting houses from 1 to 3.  This should make the game a little more fun early on.\n- Added a linear difficulty increase curve.  Before, if you could hold your own with 16 houses on screen, the game would never get harder for you.  Now, it will continue to get faster and harder as time goes on.\n- Dead houses will now be revived if 16 houses are already on the screen.  Before, if you filled the screen with houses, a couple dead houses actually made the game easier.  Not anymore.\n- Greatly reduced the frequency of breakers being thrown.  They get thrown more often as the game continues, though.\n- Keys have a chance to break even if they are pressed when no houses are displaying that key.  This will punish keyspamming.\n- Added the ability to mute the music while playing the game.

Since I didn't get around to explaining it in the game itself, the idea is as follows:\n\nYou are a wizard, yay! But you have been cursed by Wizardy McVillainFace, and your power is slowly draining. You have to hurry to find the cure for your curse before it is too late!\n\n[![screenshot-2017-07-30-22-40-07.png](///raw/d2d/3/z/5a39.png)](http://www.joe-fowler.co.uk/misc/ludumdare39/)\n\nI only got around to making two levels, so hopefully they give you enough of a taste!\n\n**Made with:**\n\nI like working on the internals for games, so this is made completely from scratch using plain old JavaScript.\n\n  * Languages:\n    * **JavaScript** (every line of the code is written from scratch)\n    * **HTML5** and **CSS** (almost none, just to put a canvas on the screen)\n  * Tools:\n    * **Gimp** (all of the graphics were hand-drawn)\n    * **Vim** (all the code was written in the one true text editor :) )\n    * **Chromium** (I didn't test other browsers, sorry! :( )\n    * **Git** (To save my progress - all the code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Scrumplesplunge/ludumdare39)!)\n\nYou can watch the **timelapse** of me making this game on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/YSl7rRPtwD8)!\n\n**What I'm happy with:**\n\nI am really happy with how the animations turned out, and with the fact that I managed to get a working side scroller. This was the first time I ever tried to make a side-on 2d game :)\n\n**What I wish I could have done better:**\n\nI really wanted more levels. The tutorial and the first level give you an impression but I would have loved to make more levels if I had time. However, I like to leave my Ludum Dare submissions untouched after the competition ends so I will have to try harder next time instead :)\n\n**BUG FIXES:**\n\nAfter submission, I have made the following bug fixes:\n\n  * Change `event.key` to `name` in a function which was broken yet worked in chrome by pure coincidence.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d2d/3/z/5a26.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/quest","author":{"name":"Scrumplesplunge","uid":15661,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/scrumplesplunge"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/Scrumplesplunge/ludumdare39"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://www.joe-fowler.co.uk/misc/ludumdare39/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"South","category":"compo","description":"![cover2.png](///raw/f70/5/z/5cd1.png)\n\n[Play here.](https://zchen.itch.io/south)\n\n​**south**​ is a relentless shooter on rails with bullet time that sends players into a rhythmic trance of power and speed.\n\n![ss1_1.PNG](///raw/f70/5/z/5cee.png)\n![ss1_2.PNG](///raw/f70/5/z/5cf1.png)\n![ss_4.PNG](///raw/f70/5/z/5a1b.png)\n\nA game done in 48 hours as part of LD39 by [Zhiming Chen](http://zhimingc.github.io/).\n\nLet me know how far you get in the game! e.g. what loop number did you get up to?","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f70/5/z/5d5a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/south","author":{"name":"zchen","uid":20607,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f70/5/z/7f48.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/zchen"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f70/5/z/5cd1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f70/5/z/5cd1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f70/5/z/5cee.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f70/5/z/5cee.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f70/5/z/5cf1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f70/5/z/5cf1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f70/5/z/5a1b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f70/5/z/5a1b.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://zchen.itch.io/south"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://zchen.itch.io/south"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://zchen.itch.io/south"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://zchen.itch.io/south"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://zchen.itch.io/south"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Magic Power","category":"compo","description":"You will play as wizard who can't live without his power.

Your ship is stranded 4 jumps from home and each jump takes a certain amount of power and time to charge.  You can send an away team on resource gathering missions to nearby asteroids, abandoned ships, and more.  You can convert supplies into power and once the jump is charged, make your way home!\n\nClick on your ship in the middle to spend supplies to level your crew, engines, or med bay.  You can also convert supplies into power at the bottom.  Clicking the advance time button will progress the away team mission, charge the jump drive, and heal onboard crew members.\n\nClick on the surrounding destinations to send an away team to investigate and gather supplies.  You can swap out crew members to try to meet recommended stats for bonuses.  Injured personnel cannot be on the away team, and you only have 1 away team at a time.\n\nOnce the jump drive is charged, the power requirement is met, and the away team is back on board, you can jump to the next area.  Be careful to keep enough power, it takes 10 per hour to keep the ship operating. \n\n\n**Known Bug** - At the character swap menu on away missions, the \"Start Mission\" button is still active, behind the window, so if you're clicking on the bottom left or bottom right crew member, please make sure the mouse is not over where the \"Start Mission\" button is, or it breaks the ability to click on anything- forcing a hard restart.  See picture for reference.  You can tell if your mouse is hovering over the button behind the window by looking at the bottom edge of the button still visible, it has a white outline if the mouse is hovering.

Compete with other players and try to top the leaderboard!\n\n## TOOLS USED:\n- Unity3d\n- Gimp\n- Audacity\n- Garage Band\n- BFXR\n\nI wasn't feeling too well this Ludum Dare and had a fever the day before it started so I'm happy I managed to complete the game despite this.

I haven't really planned out the weekend around Ludum Dare, so I've had some interruptions (both internal and external). Things that are missing and I might put in a new version after LD finishes:\n\n- Enemies. Currently the game doesn't have any, and it might introduce more tension if it did. It does need whole lot of new systems to have a space fleet battle work properly, and that had to be cut early on.\n- Music. While I can draw and I can figure out bfxr enough to produce some sounds, making music is just something I cannot try doing and expect the result not to summon Cthulhu if played. \n- Ship actions. This was the hardest thing for me to cut, because I still think it should be included, but there's only so much time I have. The player was supposed to be able to transfer fuel and passengers between ships in the fleet, which would enable to abandon ships with as less damage as possible, which would make for much more interesting gameplay.\n\nUnfortunately for the Central Europe timezone, Ludum Dare is not a very good fit - it starts and ends at 3 in the morning, and I have to go to work on Monday, so I can't stay up that long. This already shaves half a day, and I still need to sleep, code, eat, and try to have a life if possible. Oh well, what can you do.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//694/3/z/58b2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/exodus-fleet-commander","author":{"name":"Saithir","uid":13462,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/saithir"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//694/3/z/589c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//694/3/z/589c.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//694/3/z/58a3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//694/3/z/58a3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//694/3/z/58ac.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//694/3/z/58ac.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://aevi.itch.io/exodus-fleet-commander-ld39-version"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://aevi.itch.io/exodus-fleet-commander-ld39-version"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://aevi.itch.io/exodus-fleet-commander-ld39-version"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Space Tanker","category":"jam","description":"# [PLAY](https://wasea.itch.io/spacetanker)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf0XX_-TrjM\n## Lore:\nWe live in a distant future.  \nDue to high water consumption in nuclear fusion, earth needs to import water from external sources.  \nYour mission is to bring water to earth before they run out of it.

Each resource has value, cost, power and a total.\n- Value: The total amount of the dice values assigned.\n- Cost: The amount required for a unit of this resource.\n- Power: It is multiplied by the value to calculate the amount of power gained.\n- Total: The amount of units gained.\n\nThe resources are:\n- Approval: Only used for gaining power.\n- Military: Each military unit gained lowers the cost of the saboteurs.\n- Food: Each food unit increases the power gain of approval.\n- Saboteurs: Lowers the power of an opponent.

Eventually battery will hit zero and you will see stats with sent letters, scores and resulting character relations based on your performance.\n\n\n![2a7535d8553d7de15a5bacaaf5268fdf.png](///raw/e4a/a/z/6ff2.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e4a/a/z/68c8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/answer-me","author":{"name":"Viliar","uid":43598,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/viliar"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e4a/a/z/6fbd.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e4a/a/z/6fbd.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e4a/a/z/6ff2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e4a/a/z/6ff2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://brolton-mown.itch.io/answer-me-for-ludum-dare-39"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://brolton-mown.itch.io/answer-me-for-ludum-dare-39"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Generator #4875","category":"compo","description":"![header.png](///raw/978/9/z/5805.png)\n\nPlay as Generator #4875 as he works his never-ending grind to earn his meager hourly wage.

The controls for the keyboard are:\nA and D to run around with a helper, Space to Jump, Left Ctrl to interact.\n4 and 6 on the numpad to raise and lower the turret, 5 to shoot.\n\n![screen.png](///raw/632/8/z/5846.png)![screen1.png](///raw/632/8/z/5848.png)![screen2.png](///raw/632/8/z/584e.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//632/8/z/5853.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/cave-defence","author":{"name":"Vidmantas","uid":33334,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/vidmantas"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//632/8/z/5846.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//632/8/z/5846.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//632/8/z/5848.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//632/8/z/5848.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//632/8/z/584e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//632/8/z/584e.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-arV1cK1mI2YWE5azhoVEY0cmc"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-arV1cK1mI2OEN6R0o4Vl92TEE"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Attack on battery","category":"compo","description":"I wish you like it![How to play.png](///raw/249/8/z/5855.png)![Night Mode.png](///raw/249/8/z/5858.png)\n![Jugant.png](///raw/249/8/z/5856.png)\nFabulousDesu\n\nP.S: Everything is in the drive's carpet, no install required.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//249/8/z/585a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/attack-on-battery","author":{"name":"FabulousDesu","uid":35138,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/fabulousdesu"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//249/8/z/5855.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//249/8/z/5855.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//249/8/z/5858.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//249/8/z/5858.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//249/8/z/5856.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//249/8/z/5856.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B26vpVB-GTamWnY1RFNUMEJ3bW8"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Empire Showdown","category":"jam","description":"​Empire Showdown is a game where you control the destiny of a small group of people that wants to grow and become an empire.\n\nCollect food and water to keep the population alive, collect wood to build cities to keep them happy, farms to produce your own food and blacksmiths to create weapons so that you can go on war with other nations. \n\nCan you raise in POWER and put everybody else on their knees?\n\nThis game is pretty much inspired by Dwarf Fortress and a bit by Clash of Clans.\n\nThe game is pretty rough but I still hope you enjoy or at least like the concept, I will take this as a experience lesson, I kinda decided to do something a little bit more complex than I could have done, this version doesn't contain even 1/3 of what I wanted but hey, it was fun making it :) .

I actually tested all of these browsers with the offline version before uploading and they all worked fine, but I only tested the chrome version after uploading. Firefox uses some kind of fast loading javascript thing that apparently didn't want to work when using 'const', I changed everything back to magic numbers and now it works.

So for this Ludum Dare, I wanted to stream the development process for the first time. I also wanted to *finish a game* so I knew I had to keep things super simple. Focus on the mechanics and polishing the game. I also wanted to try to make a game mainly using **visual scripting**. For this I used 2 Unity3D plugins – [FlowCanvas](http://flowcanvas.paradoxnotion.com/) and [NodeCanvas](http://nodecanvas.paradoxnotion.com/). Besides Unity3D I used Aseprite, Rider for C#, Bfxr, and OBS for streaming. I had fun... mostly.\n\nIn the end, I was working too slow. For one, OBS was eating 2 CPU cores for the whole time so my computer was **super laggy**. For two, I discovered that using visual scripting for **everything** is pretty limitting. I'm a lot faster in C#. On the other hand, visual scripting was amazing for the AI behavior tree and small scripts like quitting the game when ESC is pressed. All in all, I managed to **learn a lot** during this Ludum Dare. The game turned out pretty fun but missing depth and replayability. The graphics are very basic (I'm a programmer lol) and I didn't have enough energy to improve the sound system. Next time...\n\nFeel free to check out the videos of the stream to see how I made the game and how I used **visual scripting in Unity3D**.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![2017-07-30_06-55-59_PM.png](///raw/f53/8/z/5652.png)\n![2017-07-30_06-56-14_PM.png](///raw/f53/8/z/5655.png)\n![2017-07-30_06-56-56_PM.png](///raw/f53/8/z/5657.png)\n![2017-07-30_06-57-13_PM.png](///raw/f53/8/z/5658.png)\n![2017-07-30_06-57-27_PM.png](///raw/f53/8/z/5659.png)\n![2017-07-30_06-57-43_PM.png](///raw/f53/8/z/565b.png)\n![2017-07-30_06-58-09_PM.png](///raw/f53/8/z/565e.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f53/8/z/564c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/cannon-ships","author":{"name":"chuckeles","uid":33631,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f53/8/z/5629.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/chuckeles"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f53/8/z/5652.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f53/8/z/5652.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f53/8/z/5655.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f53/8/z/5655.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f53/8/z/5657.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f53/8/z/5657.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f53/8/z/5658.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f53/8/z/5658.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f53/8/z/5659.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f53/8/z/5659.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f53/8/z/565b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f53/8/z/565b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f53/8/z/565e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f53/8/z/565e.png"}],"links":[],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":39,"title":"Electric Neon","category":"compo","description":"![PromoARt.jpg](///raw/dfb/2/z/570b.jpg)\n\nElectric neon is a fast arcade game set in the 80s.

The only 3rd party library I used is [Unity's Post Processing Stack](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing) which is available on GitHub.

The theme is Running out of Power, that's why your citizens require quite alot of power.\n\n## Game mechanics\nThe goal is to get as many citizens in your city as you can. To get people to live in houses or hotels, they require a way to get there (With a road) and they need to have power. All tiles except for roads can transfer power.\n\nTo get power, you need to place a power station or solar panels. To get them to emit power, people that work there need to be able to get there via a road.\n\nFor every factory you place 10 more people will stay in each hotel you have.\n\n\n## Controls\nLeft mouse click  - Select/place a tile\n\nRight mouse click - Destroy a tile\n\n*M - Gives you 1B dollar (CHEAT)*\n\n\n## Downloads\nIf you have set up Java correctly: https://www.dropbox.com/s/72druqhef6za8z0/LD39.zip?dl=0\n\nIf you **haven't** set up Java correctly (Includes Java, Windows only): https://www.dropbox.com/s/xklm5gj9cuguw9s/LD39%20Game%20%2B%20Java%20%28Windows%29.zip?dl=0\n\nSource: https://www.dropbox.com/s/69tkn3qh5t1zhk0/LD39%20source.rar?dl=0\n\n\nTo run the game, open \"Run game.bat\" if you're on Windows or \"Run game.sh\" if you're on Linux.\nI haven't tested the game on Mac or Linux.

Towers just meant to kill off those enemies that slip past with a sliver of health left should be kept on power saving!\n- Unlike other typical TDs, selling towers is essential to winning! Sell them to build more power sources and rebuilt them again when you get the power back!\n- Human greed and wants are infinite, satisfying them just leads to more wants to satisfy!

When you're depressed, there are things people say that hurt more than they help, no matter the intention. \n\nIn this game, you're running through every day hoping to get to the end of it. But your fatigue is limited, and each day it will get worse. If your fatigue reaches 3h, it's game over. If you make it through 30 days, it's a less bitter game over.\n\nTo jump from platform to platform, just press the space bar. Warning : the jump is \"static\", as in it will always be the same. Because when you're depressed, things seem to be the same over and over again. So plan your jumps ahead.\n\nPlatforms are text messages you receive during the day. They might be completely neutral (you don't care), good for you (your fatigue doesn't lower), or bad (your fatigue goes down faster).\n\nOnce your fatigue runs out, it's the end of the day, and the next one starts.

Ensure that your people are fed and happy, whilst making sure that your council of four ministers doesn't overthrow you in the process.\n### Gameplay\nYour regime has **might** and **resources**. You spend **resources** for basically everything - bribing officials, asking for their specific items.\nThe population has **happiness**, **satiation** (how not hungry they are) and **faith** (their faith in your regime). They all affect how fast rebellions occur slightly differently. In general, try to keep all their values high to avoid rebellions.\n\nEach **minister** has an opinion of you (**approval**) and an **opinion** of every other minister. These opinions evolve in the course of the game, from simple rules. For example, an enemy's enemy will tend to become a friend. Each minister also has a **strength**. Stronger ministers can more easily assassinate other ministers, or assassinate you. You can use the Minister of Intelligence to assassinate other ministers, but only if he likes you more than he likes them. You can also ask for a specific action from each of them, for instance the minister of production will use resources to provide satiation. This action will also decrease their approval of you.\n\nBe careful if all the ministers have positive opinions with each other, as they may gang up to defeat you.\n\nEvents may occur throughout the game, and you must respond to them in order to move on to the next turn/week.\nEssentially everything in the game has a tooltip, so hover over things if you're not sure.\n\n### Theme\nThe theme was running out of power, so I chose to interpret that as a dictatorship running out of (political) power. No dictators were harmed in the making of this game.\n\n### Notes\nUnfortunately, I didn't have time (have school) or skill to make audio, so this is a soundless game for now. It's my fifth Ludum Dare, and my first time making a game entirely with web (without using Phaser or any game library). Didn't really have time to make a tutorial either. Runs best in Google Chrome.

Your ship's scanners grow weaker as you run out of power.

Instead, I'm trying to bring the player down to a more relaxed state by focusing on the mood and keeping game play simple enough and avoid distractions like enemies and multiple objectives that would only serve to distract from that mood. That being said, I have no expectation of players to play more than once or twice and one play session can be roughly 1-5 minutes.\n\n## Links\n * Browser: https://raymoclaus.itch.io/lost-cluster\nSome visual effects have been toned down for browser optimisation.\n * Browser2: http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/697212\nIncluded this link later.

The game is fairly simple, since it's an point and click adventure heavy on graphical assets and we didn't have more time to add more complex interactions with the scenario or the characters. That may be done after the LD ends. Click on stuff or people to choose between Look - Talk - Touch.

It will soon be released as a book in multiple languages, but for the time being every comic is written in portugese. You can find it on Facebook and Tumblr.\nBom Dia e Tal and it's characters was created by Gabriel Lage, who writes and illustrates the comics, with @t6ito who tutors/manages his work to soon pierce the stars.\n\nPlay the most recent LD Version here:\n* http://yesdev.games/bomdiaetal/playld39\n\nPlay the post-jam version (when it is done) here:\n* http://yesdev.games/bomdiaetal/play\n\nSource code here:\n* https://github.com/YESdevGames/Ludum-Dare-39\n\nSoon:\nAndroid, iOS and PC!

You are a Coldridge, one of the best. They're coming for you though, and they're coming through the walls. Grab your lazpistol. You might make it out of here alive. \n\nControls: A & D or Left & Right to walk/run\nYou need to keep on your feet and roll with the punches. Instead of holding down a button to walk, you build up momentum in that direction- starting with a walk and then transitioning into a jog (tapping the opposite button slows that momentum if you want to walk again). This means you can slow down and aim without stopping, like the badass you are. I even reversed the aiming so it feels like you're slicing through stuff (and not just me being too lazy to hide the cursor). Don't worry about counting bullets, you can fry a circuit at about ten paces- but keep an eye on the light. Holding your laser out drains the battery, but it'll recharge if you put it away- so if you RUN OUT OF POWER, run. Because it only takes one touch, one lapse in concentration- and you're dead.\n\nThere isn't really a victory condition here, just... Survive. If you make it all the way through the music without dying, that might give us enough time to trace who sent those things after you.\n\nRemember, every two seconds you're not killing something- more are coming. They're not smart, but they hunt in packs. Good luck, Coldridge.\n\nMade with Unity 4 and a lil bit o' photoshop cs4\nThis is a lil rushed because I'm going camping on sunday, so I need to submit this early.
