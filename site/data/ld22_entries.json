You can see the description of the room you're currently in at any type by typing \"look\"\n\nYou can \"look at\" and \"look under\" anything named in the room description. Usually you don't have to type out the full name of the thing, so \"look at drawers\" is the same as \"look at chest of drawers\" You can also \"take\", \"drop\", \"throw\", \"wear\", \"take off\", \"turn on\", \"turn off\", \"open\" or \"eat\" some things you find.\n\n\nIf you're stuck, please post a comment here and I'll give out some hints. If you're REALLY stuck, there is solution link that contains the solutions for two of the many endings.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/85442774483541d36e45c3cff9fd20f0.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=3947","author":{"name":"qrunchmonkey","uid":3947,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a7e729ba3d44f07e24096eba5f91916f?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/qrunchmonkey/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3947-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3947-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3947-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3947-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Play

I didn't make things obvious because it is supposed to be a puzzle, but I feel I may have made what to do/how to do it a little too obscure.\n\nThe idea behind this is that the player is completely alone.

Lasers are set around the map and there is a portal somewhere that allows you get out. The portal must be powered for you to leave.\n\nUsing the WSAD keys you need to move around and discover where to go.

I guess it is vaguely to do with the theme since you're alone ... with a ghost ... in space.  Also, there's a kitten!\n\nThe game uses hand-written Javascript/HTML5 and isn't obfuscated and doesn't rely on any third party libraries. You can view-source on the HTML document and it should be fairly obvious where the code is. The graphics were generated using a project I wrote a while ago, BatchSVG (Google it if you're interested) and just straight rendering of Javascript primitives. Sounds using SFXR.\n\nIn hindsight, a game using similar mechanics, but on a simulated mini-golf course would have been both a better fit for the theme (alone: no enemies) and probably a better game. Ah well, if there's enough interest in this I might look into it.

I aimed to create something that is engrossing and takes the player on a journey. Just enjoy not having to do much and expect a few minutes of atmospheric storytelling. It's intentional low level involvement.\n\nThere are two ways (literally) to finish the game. Just keep going.\n\nHope you enjoy this little trippy & eerie plunge into the heart of a bizarre world.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This experience requires AUDIO (best enjoyed with headphones), otherwise the game will not make sense. Controls are also explained in-game: just use the arrow keys to walk around. This should run on Windows, Mac & Linux. The only thing you need is a JAVA runtime.\n\nOh and yes. There is a kitten in the game.\n\nMade with libgdx, reaper & gimp.\n\nUPDATE: Added a complete walk-through video of the game.

It is unfortunately extremely difficult to beat this game. \n\nThe improved version is available here: springworldgames.com/yae \n(Important: Not the competition entry)\n\nIt is less difficult and more features will be added there.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/61bbc89ad148aec2ef5c59edace3c8b4.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=6781","author":{"name":"Per","uid":6781,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d11619a5a91ab55825a0dff93a5753c6?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/krasse/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/6781-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/6781-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/6781-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/6781-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/6781-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/6781-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (official)","url":"http://www.springworldgames.com/ld22/"},{"label":"Improved Version","url":"http://www.springworldgames.com/yae"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFsch24mUFs"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.springworldgames.com/ld22/LD22.zip"},{"label":"Gameplay Vid","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIip1JSGNJE"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":54},{"area":"audio","rank":357,"score":2.17},{"area":"community","rank":370,"score":2.4},{"area":"humor","rank":372,"score":1.73},{"area":"graphics","rank":402,"score":2.44},{"area":"overall","rank":417,"score":2.56},{"area":"fun","rank":425,"score":2.18},{"area":"innovation","rank":495,"score":2.06},{"area":"mood","rank":589,"score":1.62},{"area":"theme","rank":616,"score":1.82}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Zombie City","category":"compo","description":"Here is my first entry on the Ludum Dare\n\nZombie city is a small game where you must reach the exit of a quarantine city, your only goal is to reach the exit door but there are a lot of zombies to kill and dodge.\n\nhave fun!\n\nCONTROLS \nMovement - WASD and Arrows\nJump - Space\nShoot - Left Mouse button\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/cc66bb7b67b9efb182e7d9edd7dc0a42.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=8045","author":{"name":"omarchapa","uid":8045,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/80d121b0d02c4324a7c19b663d43c1d2?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/omarchapa/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8045-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8045-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1317919/WebPlayer.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"humor","rank":173,"score":2.4},{"area":"mood","rank":355,"score":2.3},{"area":"theme","rank":360,"score":2.62},{"area":"fun","rank":368,"score":2.31},{"area":"graphics","rank":394,"score":2.46},{"area":"overall","rank":448,"score":2.46},{"area":"audio","rank":594,"score":1},{"area":"innovation","rank":632,"score":1.62},{"area":"community","rank":649,"score":1.67},{"area":"coolness","rank":685,"score":0}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"A Lone Story","category":"jam","description":"You get to follow Lone, the main character who finds himself all alone in the world.

self doubt and the turmoil of existential crisis to overcome the banal and the asinine. Press X to ponder the bleakness of existence.\n\nI took 'Alone' to mean sadness and made a Philosophy-em-up. Enemies are mere bystanders who shout meaningless drivel at you, which drives you to self-doubt. The more doubt you have, the more you fall into depression, represented by a parallel world. To overcome the trials of the real world though you must face doubt and uncertainty.\n\nBasically there are two levels overlaid on top of each other, and they are blended together based on the damage you have taken. You must take at least some damage to be able to walk through the 'happy' terrain and on the 'sad' terrain, but if you take too much you'll die. To complete the level you have the pick up a maguffin (the bit of paper lodged in the side of the hill).\n\nI kind of liked to concept, but ran out of time, as usual. Consequently there is only one level. I spent my last couple of hours polishing the graphics, which came out rather nicely, I think.\n\nI used Flashpunk and Flash Builder for code. The art was done with the Gimp and a cheap graphics tablet. The sounds effects were made in Sfxr and the dreadful music using Wolfram Tones.

Your goal is to escape Post-Apocalyptic Earth via a rocket. You must balance building of defenses with the building of your rocket, as the zombies *will* overrun you. Sooner than later.\nLiam Mith is, as far as he knows, the last person alive in the world. Any communications by radio ceased about 2 years ago, when the Virus hit. The year is 2047, and the world is much different than now. Technology had made absolutely incredible advances. We were on Mars, we were traveling throughout the the solar system to gather materials. Most governments across the world had crumpled, and people did as they pleased. They used their will to shape the world around them, not other people. It was a golden age.\n\nUnfortunately, progress sometimes has side-effects. The entire world was connected electronically. Everyone wore an iEye (pronounced eye),  a contact lens that had the power of todays supercomputers thanks to Quantum Computing. Everything, even your toilet, was wired for network access.\n\nThen the Sun, like it does, screwed everything up when it decided to emit a solar flare so massive it consumed Mercury entirely. The resulting wave of electromagnetic energy had an odd effect, because of the safeguards we had put in place against it to protect our precious electronics. Near instantaneously, every person who was wearing their iEye went abso-freaking-lutely insane. The massive radiation had caused instant cancer in nearly every place of the body, and fried certain parts of the iEye programming. The effects varied pretty widely, but one thing was constant: insanity.\n\nOur current concept of Zombies does not cover what happened to these people. Image what would happen if every cell in your body simultaneously went through a period of such rapid uncontrolled growth, that you went from standing to mush. The pain these people went through is absolutely indescribable, and if not for their iEyes, they would have been killed instantly. But obviously, that didn't happen.\n\nThe iEye was the only processor left, and the sudden radiation burst caused it to fuse with the brainstem in most cases. The effect this had was clear and present: you had formings of flesh running about at lightning speed with only animalistic functions left to them, but amplified by Quantum Computing.

The volcano is also filled with kittens who are completely obsessed with you. In each room you have to destroy all 5 of the kittens attached to you by throwing them in lava (spacebar).

I've only slept 7 hours between those times, wich isn't really special or something, but just to let you guys know.\n\nThe first half hour I was looking for an idea, and I'm not sure how I got this idea, but I was thinking about working together, where you have to leave someone behind.\n\nYes, there are bugs in this game. Some big bugs. But there just wasn't enough time.\n\nI learned a lot of this Ludum Dare. A lot about programming, about planning. I really enjoyed the community and was talking on the IRC chat half of the time. People there gave me the motivation to go on, when I was about to quit.\n\nThe most important things I wanted to improve were the level features, and the amount of levels. Right now the game isn't really long, but I hope it can amuse you for 5 minutes or longer.\n\nFor everyone who has found the secret kitten: Awesome!\nPlease send me a message or write a comment about that you found it. But please don't spoil where you found it! Thanks.\n\nEveryone: Thanks for playing this, thanks for reading this, thanks for making Ludum Dare such a great community. I love you guys.\n\nGreetings, Daniel Haazen / Sheep","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/238a37649b0fa13f08dc91dda1900bbe.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=5959","author":{"name":"Sheep","uid":5959,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9e9fadcdac7fc0bb3ef8f38c4dae0e6d?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/sheepolution/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/5959-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/5959-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/5959-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/5959-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/5959-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/5959-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/40665686/Lonely%20Tower.exe"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/40665686/Lonely%20Tower%20Source.gmk"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":51},{"area":"theme","rank":30,"score":3.81},{"area":"mood","rank":31,"score":3.69},{"area":"community","rank":36,"score":3.6},{"area":"overall","rank":50,"score":3.5},{"area":"innovation","rank":63,"score":3.4},{"area":"humor","rank":86,"score":2.91},{"area":"audio","rank":106,"score":3.07},{"area":"fun","rank":153,"score":2.87},{"area":"graphics","rank":245,"score":2.93}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Lonesome Runner","category":"compo","description":"Lonesome Runner is a platformer with a random generated world.

The winner is given the title of 'Al 1' - will it be you?\n\nHOW TO PLAY\n-\nUse left/right to charge during the powerup phase. At the top of the screen is a minimap - the small red part of the line is the target, and the green arrow is approximately where you will land at your current speed.\n\nWhen you're in the air, press the displayed keys to score combos, press left to slow down your flight so you hit the target, and make sure you press space before you land otherwise you won't score any points.\n\nTo score a kitten bonus, when the combo letter is 'K', hold shift when you press K. You must land directly on the target to score kitten bonuses. After 3 rounds, the game is over.\n\nTHE BIT WHERE I EXCUSE THE CRAPPINESS OF THE GAME\n-\nThough I actually liked the theme this time, I came quite late and unprepared to this LD, and started coding about 36 hours in. I wasn't happy with the game by the Compo cutoff, and normally I would just submit what I had as a compo entry, but this time round I felt like actually completing something. As a result, while it's missing much in the way of graphics and is completely absent of audio, as far as gameplay goes it's perhaps the most complete LD entry I've made. That doesn't make it any less terrible - the game reminds me of many horribly generic Flash games, but without the presentation, addictiveness or convenience - but I hope that the completely unrelated kitten bonus acts as some compensation for this.\n\nI probably won't be developing this further, though if I do I think I'd turn it into a multi-event game, tune the gameplay/opponents a bit more, add a few little features to give it more depth, and vastly improve the presentation.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/93c27d06fd13ea28a8266c0fdec94585.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=1078","author":{"name":"shockedfrog","uid":1078,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ccfe7ddb018253a40c3336723c61fc43?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/shockedfrog/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/1078-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/1078-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/1078-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/1078-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.shockedfrog.com/misc/al1-win.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"fun","rank":19,"score":3.21},{"area":"innovation","rank":25,"score":3.08},{"area":"humor","rank":47,"score":2.42},{"area":"overall","rank":53,"score":2.93},{"area":"graphics","rank":120,"score":2.36},{"area":"audio","rank":131,"score":1.17},{"area":"theme","rank":143,"score":1.85},{"area":"mood","rank":152,"score":1.4},{"area":"community","rank":594,"score":1.83},{"area":"coolness","rank":641,"score":10}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Alone in Space","category":"compo","description":"Unity game.

There are no textures, so the game is only 1MB in size. \n\nI can build a more complete version if people enjoy the game.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/95cab9c7bcd4baf76a83ad17a20543e2.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=7283","author":{"name":"Vic","uid":7283,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f5e7ad2aa10f02451567370a4e78c6cc?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/vic/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7283-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7283-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7283-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7283-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7283-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7283-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/45870630/WebPlayer.html"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/45870630/WebPlayer.html"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/45870630/WebPlayer.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/45870630/GameScripts.rar"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":51},{"area":"graphics","rank":29,"score":4},{"area":"overall","rank":105,"score":3.28},{"area":"mood","rank":123,"score":3.13},{"area":"theme","rank":146,"score":3.29},{"area":"innovation","rank":270,"score":2.63},{"area":"fun","rank":281,"score":2.53},{"area":"community","rank":398,"score":2.36},{"area":"humor","rank":545,"score":1.33},{"area":"audio","rank":594,"score":1}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web","mac"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Alone in the Ark","category":"compo","description":"My second Ludum Dare entry!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/300e17fced58753b4a98cc89884ed225.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=5004","author":{"name":"PaulWagener","uid":5004,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/29ad57ba2a8123188a81aaf1b41e189a?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/paulwagener/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/5004-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/5004-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://paulwagener.nl/alone-in-the-ark/"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://paulwagener.nl/alone-in-the-ark/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://paulwagener.nl/alone-in-the-ark.unitypackage"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":27,"score":3.83},{"area":"audio","rank":31,"score":3.54},{"area":"mood","rank":34,"score":3.64},{"area":"innovation","rank":52,"score":3.54},{"area":"humor","rank":55,"score":3.2},{"area":"overall","rank":75,"score":3.38},{"area":"fun","rank":118,"score":3},{"area":"graphics","rank":191,"score":3.08},{"area":"coolness","rank":585,"score":17}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Alone on a raid","category":"compo","description":"To play you are going to need a mac, xcode and an iphone.

Oh, and if you find any bugs still coming up please let me know, thanks :)\n\n*edit**edit* Also pressing 'M' will mute the audio now","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/276d569bee57ec1007917f2e3d715b85.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=3343","author":{"name":"Zemmi","uid":3343,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/eb3409bf353a9e8417dfc82535ed021b?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/zemmi/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3343-shot0.gif-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3343-shot0.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3343-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3343-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3343-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3343-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3343-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3343-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3343-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3343-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://tylermolz.com/wp-content/uploads/games/urinetrouble/UrineTrouble.swf"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://tylermolz.com/wp-content/uploads/games/urinetrouble/UrineTrouble.zip"},{"label":"Web (minor fixes)","url":"http://tylermolz.com/urine-trouble/"},{"label":"Source (w/ minor fixes)","url":"http://tylermolz.com/wp-content/uploads/games/urinetrouble/UrineTroubleFIX.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":65},{"area":"humor","rank":7,"score":3.97},{"area":"fun","rank":28,"score":3.5},{"area":"innovation","rank":31,"score":3.7},{"area":"overall","rank":84,"score":3.33},{"area":"graphics","rank":213,"score":3},{"area":"theme","rank":224,"score":3.03},{"area":"audio","rank":262,"score":2.48},{"area":"mood","rank":506,"score":1.87},{"area":"community","rank":565,"score":1.94}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"/follow","category":"jam","description":"You like to be alone, but this bodyguard won't let you breathe...

I know the science and exact nature of these things is not captured in the game, but the game is meant to be fun/funny too. Check out the instructions in the game menu for the skinny on controls and goals.\n\nMore info on this here: http://whilefun.com/games.php#LD22\n\nControls are X (select in menu), and C, and arrows. Read the instructions for more info :)\n\nMore details, if you want them: You select your \"alone\" preference then play through day (office) and night (city/street) cycles. You must carefully balance your anxiety and energy levels, while striving to be understood by those around you. The more anxious you are and the less energy you have, the more likely you will be misunderstood. At the end of the day (you're understoood, or too anxious), you get to recharge in the way you like. The goal of the night cycle is to lower your anxiety and raise your energy for the next day. Failure to do this means you won't be understood, and ultimately your self worth and lonliness will increase. If your self worth goes too low, you will die. Boy did I make that sound boring.

It will only last you 5 minutes, but I can guarantee that what you read in it will last you for a very long time. It only has one gameplay element (figure out the password), and the rest is a loose story. This was my first LD, and I realized how little I knew about programming, especially seeing what others have made. \n\nI would appreciate any advice on more efficient or better programming methods (perhaps a generous soul would look at my poor, aching source code and tell me what I should have done instead?). Does anyone know a good way to map in java OTHER than defining rectangles where you can/can't go. Better question: can someone tell me that way? I'm sure I did a very poor job of it.\n\nIn perspective, though, I'm happy with it! I learned a lot about game programming, and I'm hoping to do much better next time. Thanks for giving it a look!

Try to figure out how to passively use the different light sources and the impact they have on the barely perceived threats. If you want more info (including spoilers) and a peak at my workflow check out the text doc I also uploaded.\n\nThings I would change. HTML5 may be ready for \"real\" games but my particular HTML5 framework is not. Wish I had switched to Flixel once I realized the game was running at 4fps on my 1st gen iPad. The game has touch controls but good luck using them at 4fps. Collision detection was quick and dirty (broken in MobileSafari, probably because of a precision bug). Could be more forgiving. Keyboard input is unidirectional with the most recent key canceling simultaneous keypresses.\n\nThings I'm proud of. I used cellular automata to generate levels dynamically and A* path finding to ensure they're solvable before presenting to the player. Check the source for references. Pretty happy with the art too.\n\nSleep now.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/65c606bdc0401148c76b087fdffc1c5a.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=4017","author":{"name":"Shaun Inman","uid":4017,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6347fd0ec5470b2dc7c9678262b8a7fa?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/shauninman/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4017-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4017-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4017-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4017-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web & Source","url":"http://shauninman.com/ludumdare/alone/"},{"label":"Workflow Doc","url":"http://shauninman.com/ludumdare/alone/alone.txt"},{"label":"Postmortem","url":"http://shauninman.com/archive/2011/12/21/sinkhole_postmortem"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":76},{"area":"theme","rank":52,"score":3.67},{"area":"mood","rank":97,"score":3.27},{"area":"overall","rank":135,"score":3.17},{"area":"graphics","rank":139,"score":3.35},{"area":"innovation","rank":172,"score":2.94},{"area":"fun","rank":203,"score":2.74},{"area":"humor","rank":428,"score":1.6},{"area":"community","rank":516,"score":2.05},{"area":"audio","rank":590,"score":1.06}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Solitude","category":"jam","description":"Randomly generated platformer developed in Flixel.\n\nCut a swath through the army that created you, in order to escape and finally be left alone...\n\nHad an awesome time putting this together, first time really playing with Flixel.

To see all sides of it, you need to play it 2-3 times.\n\nI think this theme wasn't the easiest one, but for me it was something which pushed to make something different than I usually do. Less gameplay, more thinking about what being alone can mean, and trying to put that into a few different stages of something. What if you want to be alone? Are you alone, or somebody else? Are you alone because there's nobody around, or because there are too much people? Are you alone because of feeling disconnected to people close to you?\n\nSo in my game there really isn't very much to do actually.. I don't want to spoil it all, but it does vary between each play if you do a bit different things.\n\nThe game has a 8 minute soundtrack, with start position synced to real clock, so it continues playing if you start game again right after exiting it.\n\nThere is also a video link. But remember that the play experience changes a bit if you play it better, and the video naturally doesn't spoil that for you, so the video really isn't a substitute for playing it yourself!\n\nPS.

This is clearly more a tech demo than a fully-fledged game, but we'll polish it further down the road :)\n\nHave fun solving the... oops, almost spoiled what it is :D","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/8832014abc147f901cecb05df57c00dd.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=3168","author":{"name":"Grungi Ankhfire","uid":3168,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1def35ff8db327eebf09ca41228c6de6?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/grungi-ankhfire/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3168-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3168-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3168-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3168-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.gsmproductions.com/games/safety91/safety_91.zip"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.gsmproductions.com/games/safety91/Safety%2091.zip"},{"label":"Linux (32 bits)","url":"http://www.gsmproductions.com/games/safety91/safety91_1.0.0_i386.deb"},{"label":"Linux (64 bits)","url":"http://www.gsmproductions.com/games/safety91/safety91_1.0.0_amd64.deb"},{"label":"OSX","url":"http://www.gsmproductions.com/games/safety91/Safety%2091.app.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":71,"score":2.5},{"area":"innovation","rank":92,"score":2.2},{"area":"audio","rank":107,"score":2},{"area":"graphics","rank":123,"score":2.33},{"area":"overall","rank":129,"score":2.2},{"area":"fun","rank":149,"score":1.6},{"area":"coolness","rank":585,"score":17}],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux","mac"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"She Loves You","category":"compo","description":"She Loves You\n  LD22 entry by Kostas \"Bad Sector\" Michalopoulos\n    made it on almost 5min mark\n\nControls: WASD, right click to jump\nGoal:     be around her or you'll die\n          do not be too much around her or she'll cry\n              and give her gifts\n\nImportant note: if you experience crashes, errors or other issues at startup, download the latest version of Java from http://java.com/ - especially Linux users should use that version (you can place it at some subfolder without installing it system-wide) because most distro bundled versions do not seem to work!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/4819c1876b4b4bdf40e5aab3cc7d50b3.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=3544","author":{"name":"Bad Sector","uid":3544,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c9dc90111e90ae40541e2e271cabe9db?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/bad-sector/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3544-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3544-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3544-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3544-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://runtimelegend.com/games/sly/sly.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://runtimelegend.com/games/sly/sly.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://runtimelegend.com/games/sly/sly.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://runtimelegend.com/games/sly/sly.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":11,"score":3.91},{"area":"graphics","rank":29,"score":4},{"area":"innovation","rank":37,"score":3.63},{"area":"mood","rank":113,"score":3.2},{"area":"humor","rank":136,"score":2.54},{"area":"theme","rank":146,"score":3.29},{"area":"fun","rank":151,"score":2.88},{"area":"overall","rank":186,"score":3},{"area":"coolness","rank":252,"score":47},{"area":"audio","rank":348,"score":2.19}],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"shoot stab sprint save shooter battle","category":"jam","description":"Shoot, Stab, Sprint, Save and Shooter your way to victory in this fast paced, action tactical shooter.

It's a short but sweet game and I think we're mostly happy with how it turned out.\n\nDivided is a short puzzle platformer with 11 levels for you to enjoy. You play as a character named Ink, working as you try to escape each room and remove him from the clutches of the mysterious \"other person\" he talks about. \n\nYou control both Ink and his shadow at the same time, so you'll have to get creative to solve some of the puzzles you'll come across. Keep in mind that the placement of your character means everything in this game.\n\nThere's bound to be some glitches as there are with most of the games here. To remedy any glitches in the game, we have a reset button for each level.\n\nHere are the controls:\n\nRight and Left: Move \nUp: Enter Doors\nSpace: Jump\nEnter: Select\nR: Reset Level\n\nNote: This game also supports gamepads!\n\nWe hope that you enjoy our game, we worked pretty hard on it and hope you have as much fun with it as we did making it!\n\n[Edit] - If the game crashes for you, try the \"Windows - Minimal\" version.  The minimal version doesn't load all of the level text overlay pictures at once.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/fa8a03efd9a605fe50d82bb98c87d141.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=8689","author":{"name":"TeamInk","uid":8689,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/734ea5ecb398cad58756088e1cf488d4?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/teamink/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8689-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8689-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8689-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8689-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8689-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8689-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?3q0cqqny7ndz29t"},{"label":"Windows - Minimal","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?fqqxf4wv5cdqzfd"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?kiu3madip1m9om9"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?wnlkne9hnojbawd"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":5,"score":4.43},{"area":"innovation","rank":7,"score":3.57},{"area":"mood","rank":10,"score":3.58},{"area":"audio","rank":12,"score":3.58},{"area":"overall","rank":13,"score":3.57},{"area":"fun","rank":14,"score":3.38},{"area":"theme","rank":30,"score":3.14},{"area":"community","rank":30,"score":3.67},{"area":"humor","rank":74,"score":1.88},{"area":"coolness","rank":685,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Drill Killer","category":"compo","description":"Version 1.0\n\nWho is the Drill Killer?

They are in this dark pit and stuck on a pillar all alone. There would be text-based narration like 'Bastion'.\n\nThe gameplay was supposed to be as follows: as the game starts, the player would say something to the effect of 'Every now and then I have a good day, think look up and I feel like I could float on air'. As he says this, gravity stops for a moment and the player can jump and float to the next pillar. At each pillar the player would say something new, indicating the journey out of depression is working. As the player climbs higher and higher the background would become lighter and eventually the stars falling in the background would become leaves and the sun would break through the fog in the background.\n\nObviously the game doesn't have much of what I've described in it - you can move and jump with the arrow keys and spacebar. Sounds should work in Chrome and Firefox, music will only work in Chrome. I haven't tested on other browsers.\n\nMainly just putting this here so I can say I was in, and to get some feedback on my idea :P","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b133e9dbf66871668d182c1bc4b4df44.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=5348","author":{"name":"aaronsnoswell","uid":5348,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ffbc0e7196b2f84159f59eeb2bd05fdc?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/aaronsnoswell/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/5348-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/5348-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/5348-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/5348-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://elucidatedbinary.com/ld22/"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/aaronsnoswell/ludumdare-22"}],"ratings":[{"area":"audio","rank":112,"score":1.91},{"area":"theme","rank":135,"score":1.91},{"area":"humor","rank":153,"score":1},{"area":"mood","rank":158,"score":1.3},{"area":"innovation","rank":163,"score":1.4},{"area":"graphics","rank":165,"score":1.5},{"area":"overall","rank":168,"score":1.33},{"area":"fun","rank":168,"score":1.09},{"area":"coolness","rank":605,"score":14}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"TownAlone[DISTRICT 214]","category":"jam","description":"Well, this is very short game.\n\nWASD - movement\nQ - open evidence log\nLMB - use selected object\nRMB - examine selected object\nEsc - return to the main menu","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/23845418f0769b4433757961aa9801fe.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=2280","author":{"name":"nuprahtor","uid":2280,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5745dfb986ef809f19aede7e5e771dd0?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/nuprahtor/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/2280-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/2280-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://foul-invasion.ucoz.ru/Games/TownAlone/WebPlayer.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"mood","rank":1,"score":4.04},{"area":"theme","rank":10,"score":3.71},{"area":"graphics","rank":49,"score":3.3},{"area":"audio","rank":51,"score":2.92},{"area":"overall","rank":53,"score":2.93},{"area":"innovation","rank":70,"score":2.44},{"area":"fun","rank":111,"score":2.12},{"area":"humor","rank":124,"score":1.36},{"area":"coolness","rank":338,"score":37},{"area":"community","rank":453,"score":2.2}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Uncorrupted","category":"compo","description":"You wake up, not knowing where or who you are.

It's probably the only submission about a murder/suicide.  A man pushes his wife out of a hot air balloon so he can be truly alone, only to face the wrath of karma.  He dies, and ends up in limbo where he will be alone for eternity.  The funny thing is, he likes it.  He's finally at rest.  But there's more to it than that.  He's insane.  And not in an interesting and quirky way, in a \"I painted a portrait of you with my feces, but I ate it before I had a chance to give it to you\" kind of way.  There is no hot air balloon, he just pushes her out the window and runs into the street.  Those are not birds, they're cars.  Those are not fighter planes and UFOs, they're police.  Under it all, this is a pretty dark story about a man who murders his wife and commits suicide by cop.  But that's depressing and hard to draw, so you get clouds and balloons.  I thought you'd enjoy that more.\n\nThis is an HTML5 game, so it's best to use the latest version of Chrome or Firefox.  Opera and Safari also work.  IE probably will not work.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/6b6570364804de30fef9818fff98f221.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=8517","author":{"name":"uzimonkey","uid":8517,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5316d692cc603c3ad2df0f03869bb96b?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/uzimonkey/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8517-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8517-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8517-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8517-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8517-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8517-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8517-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8517-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.uzimonkey.com/?page_id=34"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://uzimonkey.com/ld22/uzimonkey/Alone/Alonev1.zip"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCSvfHJKVOQ"},{"label":"Post-Mortem","url":"http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2011/12/19/alone-hot-air-balloon-game-post-mortem/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":74},{"area":"humor","rank":54,"score":3.22},{"area":"community","rank":56,"score":3.4},{"area":"graphics","rank":135,"score":3.36},{"area":"theme","rank":392,"score":2.54},{"area":"audio","rank":395,"score":2.04},{"area":"mood","rank":435,"score":2.04},{"area":"overall","rank":466,"score":2.43},{"area":"fun","rank":492,"score":2},{"area":"innovation","rank":557,"score":1.85}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"alone I art","category":"jam","description":"\"alone I art\" is a game about spending valuable time alone with art.\n\nYou're a shady character in a museum.

It doesn't run in fullscreen anymore and crashes way less. If you found it crashing the first time, play this and see how it goes.\n\n------\nHOW TO PLAY:\nPress Z to shoot an organ. This gets rid of some of your life.\nArrow keys to move. Get to exit.\n------\n\nTrepang (aka \"Project Chordwing\") was done by us! We're Dan, Wilson, and Eric, and we're undergraduates from the University of Victoria. None of us before had any real gamedev experience, so pardon us if you find it pretty crappy. We love it like our child in all its DOS-like goodness.\n\nTrepang is the story of Wopley the Sea Cucumber, out on an adventure to escape the endless cave. Sadly sea cucumbers aren't that smart, so Wopley doesn't realize the cave is endless. In order to \"complete\" his quest, Wopley must bypass countless evil Starfish, Squids, and Jellyfish blocking his path. But if he can't escape them, how can he defeat them? BY EJECTING HIS OWN ORGANS OF COURSE! Sea Cucumbers actually do that.\n\nThe theme of being \"Alone\" comes from the idea of being the only one of your kind and how you need to expend yourself in order to survive. Community is uplifting, and the game symbolizes its absence.\n\nWe coded TREPANG in C and SDL. The game generates random caves using cellular state automata and creates a solvable exit using Dijkstra's Algorithm. The rest is just regular game design magic. There are a lot of bugs, so if you find one, please post a comment. We could use it for fixes!

I wanted to make some games for a long time, but I have always been too lazy to do so. Until now. Also, I decided to try a new language for the occasion. You might notice that the title of the window is \"hello world\" :)\nI used Flixel as a game engine,  bfxr.net for sounds assets, and http://videogamena.me/ to find a name.\n\nMy original design was :\n- a survival game, based on scoring and combo\n- PLENTY of ennemies\n- melee fighting\n- grabbing and juggling with enemies\n- \"wall jump\" on knocked-up enemies\n\nI quickly came with mouvements controls that I found really cool. I had enemies moving around (wall jumping and climbing) shortly after.\n\nThe I tried to implements combat mechanics. I intended to use the mouse for jungling with enemies and dashing toward them, but I forgot that you couldn't right clic with flash. And that mac users also cannot.\n\nSo I spend almost the entire first day trying to come with keyboard controls that felt right, but I couldn't. Shortly after midnight I gave up and changed my design to make it a shooting game. I had it working by the time I went to bed.\n\nI spend the second day adding different type of enemies,  levels, scoring mechanism, sounds, a few visual effects (mostly to give feedback to the player), and a proper debug mode. I spend some time tweaking difficulty, and ended up with far less enemies than before (max is 5/6 right now)\n\nI felt the game was finished almost 5 hours before the deadline, and even though I could have easily add sprites, a level editor and maybe an enemy editor, I was just too lazy to do so :)\n\nFor those of you who want to play with the debug mode, you can enable it by pressing SHIFT in the instruction screen. When debug mode is active, you can choose wich level you want to play by pressing 1-5 from this screen.\nEnemies won't automaticly spawn in debug mode. \n\nAs it is my first game ever, I would love to get feedbacks from you guys. Also, don't forget to post your score!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/0b2d4c8355bb634d21283ad3382297f4.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=7971","author":{"name":"PapyPilgrim","uid":7971,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2816298e80b0fe6e93a0d120a6f3c7a3?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/papygaragos/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7971-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7971-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7971-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7971-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7971-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7971-shot2.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://papypilgrim.com/portfolio/deadly-robot-spree/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/44222526/ld48/src.zip"},{"label":"My Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/papypilgrim"}],"ratings":[{"area":"fun","rank":59,"score":3.24},{"area":"overall","rank":395,"score":2.59},{"area":"coolness","rank":398,"score":33},{"area":"innovation","rank":437,"score":2.18},{"area":"audio","rank":443,"score":1.87},{"area":"mood","rank":529,"score":1.8},{"area":"humor","rank":545,"score":1.33},{"area":"graphics","rank":653,"score":1.65},{"area":"theme","rank":681,"score":1.53},{"area":"community","rank":688,"score":1.5}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Descension","category":"compo","description":"The game is called Descension and is basically a voxel-based dungeon-crawler.

Do you see them?\n\nBlips out in the distance.\n\nThese are all that remain of those who have long since left this place.\n\nAnd when you leave, you too will leave your own.\n\nLike a message in a bottle...\n\nA forgotten memory...\n\nThis is what it means to be alone.\n\n\nIF YOU DON'T GET IT:\n\nNONE of the blips you encounter have been hand crafted. Every one of them has been left behind by a real person--such as you--entering the realm, and not fictional beings thought up by a developer. \n\nThere is no way to know who left them behind. No name, no link, no nothing. You explore alone. You leave alone. Despite being so close to what others have done, you never meet them, and never know their name.\n\nThe closest thing to any sort of connection you will ever have is when you leave, as a blip of your own will be left behind.\n\ntl;dr - It's art. (Though really, it makes a LOT more sense if you read the above.)\n\nWHAT TO DO:\n\nUse wasd, arrow keys, or mouse buttons to move, and the mouse to look. It's recommended that you first look around to discover a blip.\n\nChrome highly recommended. This thing is iffy about if it wants to work with other browsers; I've had mixed success with Firefox.\n\nOH, and for some reason the library I'm using locks your movement if you hit Q, and won't give it back. So don't hit Q. I wish I could have fixed that.\n\n\nWHAT IS THIS?\n\nEach blip is generated from previous users, based on how they explored while they were looking around. When you leave the page, your own exploration--your \"memories\"--will become another one of those blips.\n\nIt's rather difficult to call this a game, I suppose... I was trying to create something artsy that pushed the limits of what a game is, based on the definition that a game is an \"Interactive Experience.\" I'm not sure how well I did.\n\n\nTHE TECHNOLOGY\n\nThis uses WebGL, PHP, Ajax, MySQL, HTML, and JavaScript.\n\nGoing into this, I knew NOTHING about WebGL, PHP, Ajax, or MySQL, and the last time I used HTML and JavaScript was ten years ago.\n\nDon't ask me how I pulled it off.\n\nMaaaaaajor thanks/credit/props to so many tutorial sites I can't even remember right now, but probably most of all to a man known as Paul Lewis. His WebGL tutorials are amazing, and not only that, but they made it possible for me to follow through with my idea. His website: http://aerotwist.com/ \n\nThat said, please do try not to wreck my server. :)\n\nEDIT - Because Internet Explorer does NOT support WebGL, I've added a notification for users that try to run the game on non-WebGL browsers. The only difference between it and the 48 Original version is the bit of code that handles that notification.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/86dc2c2848c52ef1fdf527e5da72cda6.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=8158","author":{"name":"Ludexor Studios","uid":8158,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3b0533605bcfe0f08dbb6efd9ed75989?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/ludexor-studios/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8158-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8158-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web - \"Fixed\" (Read Below)","url":"http://www.ludexor.net/"},{"label":"Web - 48 Original","url":"http://www.ludexor.net/index_without_ie_warning.php"},{"label":"If The Server Is Down, Click Here","url":"http://ludexor.tumblr.com/post/14501226536/so-forgotten-memories-is-down"},{"label":"~Silly Christmas Version~","url":"http://ludexor.net/xmas.php"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://pastebin.com/WFCC9RQF"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":71},{"area":"innovation","rank":23,"score":3.76},{"area":"community","rank":100,"score":3.18},{"area":"graphics","rank":112,"score":3.48},{"area":"theme","rank":245,"score":2.93},{"area":"overall","rank":296,"score":2.79},{"area":"mood","rank":314,"score":2.41},{"area":"fun","rank":514,"score":1.98},{"area":"audio","rank":515,"score":1.3},{"area":"humor","rank":648,"score":1.11}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Hikikomori Manager 2012","category":"compo","description":"hikikomori (countable and uncountable; plural hikikomori)\n\n   1.

I'd love to add more content, a story and an actual ending - we'll see...\nAlso, this was not only my first Ludum Dare but this is the first game I ever released.\n\nControls: Arrow keys + Z + X\n\nThe tools I used:\n- Game Maker 6.1\n- Musagi and Audacity (sound)\n- Gimp (some graphics)\n\nThis is Eelfroth, signing off. I was in! \n\nEDIT: The problem with the cut-off edges should be fixed now. Go to the options menu or press F5 to adjust the scale. \nIf you have experienced low framerates, you can now press F10 to deactivate the dynamic vignetting effect and replace it with a single sprite. This damages the look and mood very badly - use it only if the game runs really slow!

I wanted to explore the grid-based and non-grid-based interactions a bit more. Since I only had about 5-6 hours to work on this I didn't very many levels in (only 1!) and the theme isn't very present. Other than the fact that Dan is alone in this dungeon. Hopefully it's well polished though and doesn't have any major bugs. \n\nBeing away all weekend with limited computer time as well as no internet means I couldn't exactly be community active either.

It's a puzzle platformer based around a mechanic of \"uniqueness\".  The style is somewhat similar to that of \"The Company of Myself\".\n\nNote: the opening screen says \"I am not very special.\"  You might miss it if you press buttons and such during load.\n\n=====\n\nOS specific notes:\nWindows users: *You should be totally fine.*\nIf running OneOfAKind.exe doesn't work for you, give OneOfAKind_VS.exe a shot. (You'll need the .NET Framework for that version)\n\nOSX users: *You should be totally fine, as long as you extract OneOfAKind.app from the .dmg file.  Do not try to run it within the .dmg.*\nNote, however, that the download is ridiculously large (150MB) and the .app is even larger (>400MB), because I had to fit the entire Mono install in there.  Just delete it after you play.\n\nLinux users: Tao seems to be broken under 64-bit, so I don't know if you can run if you're using 64-bit.  If you're under 32-bit, it runs fine if you install mono.  You need to install the following packages:\nmono-runtime\ngtk-sharp2\nlibsdl1.2debian-all\nlibsdl-mixer1.2\nlibsdl-ttf-2.0-0\nlibsdl-image1.2\n\nAlternatively, you can run the windows version using wine.  Simply use winetricks mono2.8 to install mono and you should be good to go.\n\nIf you can't get the game to run, you can just watch a video of me playing through the game here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6WRB7Vl3dE\n\n(Note: Sorry, there's no \"quit\" button--just close the application window to exit)\n\nIf your keyboard is super-duper-weird, you can use Enter instead of Space or R instead of Escape.\n\n======\n\nI don't think the puzzle difficulty is quite too hard...there's a little more you can do with it, but obviously I don't have time for more than there is right now.\n\nFun fact: if you want to have a shot at editing the levels, you can edit the images under the /lvl directory.  The level[x].png files are the tile maps, while level_backdrop[x].png is the background that gets displayed.\n\nApologies for any weird glitches or bugs you run into--this was made in less than 48 hours after all (closer to 24, considering how much time I spent flailing around before I actually got started).\n\nFramework/tools used:\n-C# with SDL.net and Mono\n-Visual Studio 2010 to develop, MonoDevelop for release\n-Graphics done in GIMP\n-Music in FL Studio\n-Sound with FL Studio/bfxr\n\nMy first LD, and it was a lot of fun, despite being terribly unprepared for it and freaking out when I couldn't seem to think of any puzzles.\n\n--DDRKirby(ISQ)\n\n=====\n\nUpdate: the download links now point to v1.01, which adds no content but fixes a bug that causes the game to crash when you reach the ending (yeah...).\n\nIf you really want to be strict about the 48 hour guideline (i started late anyhow), you can get v1.00 here:\nWindows: http://db.tt/8o9U8Tzz\nLinux: http://db.tt/rlrftTaw\nOSX: http://db.tt/l85ISncw <- requires Mono + SDL

They don't, read the instructions before playing! (below and in readme).\n\nCreated in C++ with Ogre3d engine with SdkTrays GUI with my own gui images. Please, don't be afraid to rate just because it's not very good (it's my first ever game, any thoughts are appreciated)!\n\nThe Lonely Gun - you control a character ( = cube) that has a gun that makes anyone it hits lonely, meaning whenever you hit an enemy with it, every enemy *except* the one you hit disappears!\n\nA and D to move, space to fire, right mouse button to move camera. Further instructions are in README. To run the game, look in /bin for LonelyGun.exe.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\na and d to move, space to fire, right click to move camera (only if you have to, it is probably better not to).\n\nThe weapon you have is the \"Lonely Weapon\" - anyone it hits is immediately lonely, meaning every enemy except the person you hit\ndisappears. Enemies will spawn randomly every ~1 second (depending on what I change it to and forget to change the readme), and you need to stop them from getting past you bearing in mind the lonely weapon.\n\nYou have 100 health. Each enemy takes 30 health if it goes past not (not if it hits you). If you didn't know, you are the blue cube\nand the enemies are the red cubes. Score is how long you survived, in seconds.\n\nTIP: Wait for the ones at the back to span to remove all of them and give you the most time afterwards. Hitting the nearest one may make it impossible to save yourself from\nbeing hit,\n\nABOUT\nWhy is it in 3D? I have no experience with any 2d engines. Don't ask me why I decided to start with this one (Ogre3d), but this is my first game in C++ :D It was planned to\nbe a lot more developed, but I completely underestimated how bad I was at C++, having only been using it about an hour a week for a few months.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/3de4eda152d7c4351c52a971f74e5e86.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=8539","author":{"name":"pighead10","uid":8539,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/152099789648b1c940a968f525f90823?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/pighead10/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8539-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8539-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8539-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8539-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/53835113/LonelyGun.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/53835113/LDAlone_SourceAndStuff.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":56},{"area":"community","rank":275,"score":2.64},{"area":"innovation","rank":376,"score":2.35},{"area":"theme","rank":461,"score":2.33},{"area":"audio","rank":569,"score":1.1},{"area":"fun","rank":594,"score":1.71},{"area":"overall","rank":649,"score":1.81},{"area":"humor","rank":653,"score":1.09},{"area":"mood","rank":657,"score":1.36},{"area":"graphics","rank":660,"score":1.59}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Tiny planet","category":"jam","description":"An austronaun collides an asteriod (i meant, spaceship collides) and lands on an unknown planet.\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/75099fd09653fe149fabd5115ca6b9a9.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=8370","author":{"name":"Madball","uid":8370,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c7e8e5b194171147f26f0cadfc0edf0e?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/madball/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8370-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8370-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8370-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8370-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8370-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8370-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web(Flash)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/53633853/Tiny%20planet.html"},{"label":"Web(Flash)(Christmas edition)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/53633853/Tiny%20planet%20%28Christmas%20edition%29.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":68,"score":2.57},{"area":"mood","rank":84,"score":2.14},{"area":"audio","rank":87,"score":2.4},{"area":"humor","rank":94,"score":1.67},{"area":"fun","rank":99,"score":2.2},{"area":"overall","rank":123,"score":2.27},{"area":"innovation","rank":123,"score":1.86},{"area":"graphics","rank":169,"score":1.29},{"area":"coolness","rank":252,"score":47},{"area":"community","rank":491,"score":2.13}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Transposure to the Void","category":"compo","description":"Ok, so this was a good one...

Enjoy my crappy game.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/50de1ff2e7253828711d47b75cdd5780.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=7400","author":{"name":"ASOT","uid":7400,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/63f98c502dde85ac2ae663953738b714?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/asot/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7400-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7400-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7400-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7400-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7400-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7400-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/Public/LUDUM2.swf?w=904395f5&dl=1"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/Public/LUDUM2.swf?w=904395f5&dl=1"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/53829608/LUDUM2.swf"}],"ratings":[{"area":"humor","rank":9,"score":3.82},{"area":"audio","rank":163,"score":2.86},{"area":"fun","rank":216,"score":2.69},{"area":"theme","rank":249,"score":2.92},{"area":"mood","rank":274,"score":2.55},{"area":"graphics","rank":340,"score":2.62},{"area":"overall","rank":425,"score":2.54},{"area":"coolness","rank":457,"score":28},{"area":"innovation","rank":506,"score":2}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web","mac"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Shadow Glow","category":"compo","description":"Point your flashlight at things with the mouse.\nWalk with WADS.\n\nFind your way in the dark.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/3b9265879a23b09d2eba4797ab756b86.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=3202","author":{"name":"k_wright","uid":3202,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/53f17746a522feb64f12fa5ea0946291?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/k_wright/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3202-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3202-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12926434/LDAlone/WebPlayer.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":129,"score":3.35},{"area":"innovation","rank":167,"score":2.96},{"area":"mood","rank":177,"score":2.89},{"area":"overall","rank":216,"score":2.96},{"area":"audio","rank":227,"score":2.59},{"area":"graphics","rank":234,"score":2.96},{"area":"fun","rank":257,"score":2.57},{"area":"community","rank":295,"score":2.6},{"area":"humor","rank":399,"score":1.67},{"area":"coolness","rank":685,"score":0}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Shrimp","category":"compo","description":"An entry for LD48 #22. \n\nYou are a little boy alone in a scary place.

The story has three different endings, either good or bad. \n\n\nThere are many things I would have loved to add, such as music or more interaction, but ultimately ran out of time.

Actually, it doesn't come exactly as I would have wanted to.. This will be corrected in the improved version.\n\nFor now, I can give you a ( big ) hint.

I used Construct 2 as my game making software, think of it as GameMaker HTML 5, only better IMO.  I didn't get to any of the sound unfortunately as I had some neat ideas planned.  The premise was supposed to be that an alchoholic verbally abuses his family, and goes to storm out of the house, when he knocks himself out by tripping.  He then wakes up in this prison to find his family frozen in ice.  All he has is his bottle to try and save them.\nMy ideas were bigger than my 24 hours (stupid work!!) allowed me to implement.  There was gonna be demon family, a good and bad ending, and you'd have to face yourself!  Ooo and there were going to be a couple brief cutscenes.\nAll things considered, given the fact that this is my first attempt at any kind of game making contest, let alone a timed one, I'm very proud of my entry here.  I hope people find it fun to play, there was no time for bug testing or playthroughs of any kind.  So if it winds up being incompletable then I sincerely apologize.

Your goal in this game is to stay sane.  Keep yourself busy with the two mini-games to ward off anxiety, but be careful!  Making mistakes will cause you to more rapidly lose your composure.  \n \nThere is no real win condition; you can keep going forever.  There is however a definitive lose condition.  The look on your character’s face will clue you in to his current sanity level, as will the state of his surroundings.  You will know when you’ve lost and the game is over.  Even if you decide this game isn’t for you, it’s at least worth intentionally going insane to see the effects!\n \n            There are two mini-games that can either help or harm your sanity.  Pressing LEFT and RIGHT in the main screen lets you switch between them, while pressing ENTER starts a given game.  Use the ARROW KEYS to navigate through the game and ENTER to activate the currently selected node.  If you do well, your characters sanity increases.  Do poorly, and it will decrease much more quickly.  When you’re done with a game, press ESCAPE to go back to the main screen.\n \n            The computer allows you to solve simple, randomly-generated Boolean logic puzzles.  A red line represents a powered wire, while a white line is unpowered.  Pressing ENTER on one of the logic gates (nodes) cycles through the various logical operators: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and XOR.  The objective is to set up all the gates so that current flows from the left all the way to the final node on the right.  Pressing SPACE during this mini-game will check your results.  If you’re wrong, you’ll lose sanity.  If you’re right, your sanity increases and a new puzzle is generated.\n \nThe bass lets you play the other mini-game: composing.  This allows you to write an accompaniment that is played alongside the game’s main music track.  This game’s display is analogous to staff paper.  The window represents one measure, with time moving forward from left to right.  You can turn on up to three simultaneous notes per rhythmic division (sixteenth note).  Note pitch increases as you move up the screen, with the bottom being a C.  The red lines represent chord tones; stay inside the harmony and your sanity will increase.\n\nI’m not sure what else to say.  Sure it’s flawed/incomplete, but I think it’s pretty cool anyway!  \n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ec5c03001a7402d3d46056febc9d38a8.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=3827","author":{"name":"fueelin","uid":3827,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/74739ff1cdbcf79637582fe03e77b6fe?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/fueelin/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3827-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3827-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3827-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3827-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2908100/LD%2022%20-%20Filling%20Time.swf"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2908100/LD%2022%20-%20Filling%20Time.swf"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2908100/src.rar"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":175,"score":2.93},{"area":"humor","rank":197,"score":2.3},{"area":"theme","rank":209,"score":3.07},{"area":"audio","rank":312,"score":2.31},{"area":"mood","rank":375,"score":2.27},{"area":"coolness","rank":415,"score":32},{"area":"fun","rank":540,"score":1.87},{"area":"overall","rank":552,"score":2.2},{"area":"graphics","rank":638,"score":1.73},{"area":"community","rank":649,"score":1.67}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Friendship Snake","category":"compo","description":"Friendship Snake is a simple snake game.

As you get bigger, it becomes harder to avoid other lights. If you collect too many red lights, you disappear. If you form the total shell, you cut yourself off from the world.

Somehow the creature has developed the ability to make her own body glow, but it is not enough to see far off in the distance.  Fortunately, the cave is not so empty as would seem a priory.  There are some critters lurking in the dark, and they have very, very bright eyes.\n\nUsing the eyes of the critters wandering around each stage, it is possible to make a mental map of where are the platforms and jump around to the exit.  All the levels are doable with that can be seen and what can be inferred by the position of every creature or by jumping around the area.  Some of the jumps require almost pixel-perfect collision that, together with the already frustrating environment, make the experience a little less enjoyable than what I wanted.\n\nPlease don't mind the name and the fake Japanese characters on the title screen.  In the README there is the reason behind it all, for these that are interested.\n\nKuudou is made in C++ using the SDL and SDL_mixer libraries.  The sound effect (there is only one) was made with sfxr and the background music with its four notes was made with Schism Tracker and a royalty-free freeware sample.

There are also breakable objects in the level which you can break through while rolling.Also...please don't step into the fire....it hurts.\n\nWhen you are caught, you can retry the same level, but your score will be reset to zero.\n\nDefault controls: ( Can be changed in Options )\n   [UP] -> Jump\n   [DOWN] -> roll\n   [SPACE] -> activate bomb\n\n\nGood luck ...and pray that our level generator doesn't cough up impossible levels.\n\n\nps: We are very sorry that we can't give binaries to all the Linux and MacOs guys(and girls) out there .

As was his nature, he decided to perform some routine quantum mechanical experimentation on it. He had a box, he had a radioisotope, he had a detector, and he had the poison gas. But when he opened the box to see where the cat collapsed to, the box was empty! The cat, he thought, must have ran away. But it hadn't run away. It was, in fact, CATAPULTED INTO THE SPACE BETWEEN DIMENSIONS. Now it walks the maze of emptiness alone, messing with waveforms and heading towards the faint light ahead, the faintest hope of escape.\"\n\nThis is what I planned to make. An epic maze of tubes and obstacles to navigate as a lonely dimensionless cat. Instead, I was constantly being forced away from programming to visit relatives and fix computers and prepare for the holidays. A majority of the ten or so hours I did use was spent working on the rendering engine instead of, you know, the game, and another majority was spent on a couple persistent and annoying bugs. Not to mention learning how to use flash. By the end of it all, I just didn't have any motivation to go further. Perhaps if there had been a theme I could have done something with, something that had suggested a mechanic, really anything except this one which eliminated all of my good ideas. On top of it, I had to struggle with figuring out Actionscript, which turns out to be a very infuriating language for me. Maybe next time I'll have a better reason to go on, but for now I just have this half-game.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS (not provided in game):\nClick and drag to rotate the view.\nThe colored node in the center is your cat. (It is not visible to the human eye because of quantum effects and not because I couldn't figure out how images worked.)\nClick on an adjacent node, marked by the blue connections, to move to it.\nColored nodes are doors and switches. (quantum doors and switches of course)\nYou can not move to a door, but if you move to a switch, a door of the same color will vanish.\nTo win, get to the white area at the end of the map, and a new level will start.\nThere were going to be more and more complex types of obstacles than doors, but they were too buggy to fix in time for the end.\n\nHopefully next time will not be in the middle of a holiday break, have a theme that I know how to use as a mechanic, and start with me actually knowing the language. And maybe I'll even remember that I'm supposed to be making a game and not spend half the time working on rewriting existing technology and equations from scratch.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/06c43a1c6fc0ca516d180f3f948552dd.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=1634","author":{"name":"VDOgamez","uid":1634,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a8fa8e255218edc635fbeab7cb7a5c88?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/vdogamez/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/1634-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/1634-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/1634-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/1634-shot1.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Flash","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/43052873/Main.swf"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/43052873/Test.rar"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":123,"score":3.14},{"area":"coolness","rank":338,"score":37},{"area":"community","rank":519,"score":2},{"area":"humor","rank":545,"score":1.33},{"area":"overall","rank":572,"score":2.14},{"area":"graphics","rank":578,"score":1.93},{"area":"audio","rank":594,"score":1},{"area":"fun","rank":611,"score":1.64},{"area":"theme","rank":622,"score":1.79},{"area":"mood","rank":660,"score":1.33}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Chronoflux","category":"compo","description":"Didnt get a chance to put the set up for the story in your a Human that has had your mind implanted a robot in order to fix time shoot anything go wrong with a top secret experiment, which in this case has kill all humanity\n\narrows to move\nz to travel in time\nx to use\nc to jump\n\nI've uploaded an improved version it fixes warping into a wall teleporting you out of the level and the slowdown (for some reasons my bullets were checking collision with everything in the map)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/444bf0339628845358c4f2ec4db167e8.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=6537","author":{"name":"firehand94","uid":6537,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d1fde9a60c3ea23d1db07e175fe76c06?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/firehand94/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/6537-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/6537-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/29951136/Ludem/Chronoflux.zip"},{"label":"Improved(Runs Faster)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/29951136/Ludem/Chronoflux-Fix.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/29951136/Ludem/Chronoflux-source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":192,"score":2.85},{"area":"community","rank":240,"score":2.75},{"area":"overall","rank":273,"score":2.85},{"area":"audio","rank":281,"score":2.42},{"area":"fun","rank":328,"score":2.38},{"area":"coolness","rank":443,"score":30},{"area":"graphics","rank":451,"score":2.31},{"area":"humor","rank":473,"score":1.5},{"area":"mood","rank":484,"score":1.9},{"area":"theme","rank":594,"score":1.92}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Co-op Alone","category":"compo","description":"Its supposed to show that the player is alone by making him playing co-op levels alone.\n\nIts basically a puzzle where you push boxes and get a very wierd item.\n\nLanguage: C++ with SDL\n\nThe control option in the menu isnt functional yet.\nControls: arrowkeys and space to select\n\nEdit: you cant finish the game, i have a bug in loading what doors are related to which pessureplates.

The only modification was replacing the previous level 10 with a new copy moving the spawn point pixel down 1 space.\n\nThis is my first completed game. The basic principal is to make it to the blue square aka portal. Some levels are hard and some are easy. Due to a messed up collision engine there is a hidden \"Feature\" that makes some hard levels easy. If you get stuck (99% certain at least once) somewhere simply press \"R\" to restart the level. Sadly there is no sound due to a major crash issue with a sound engine.\n\nCredits:\n    Skriglitz - Code/Art/Levels\n    Detected Error - Levels/Logo\n\nTimelapse of first 48hrs (minus time chronolapse had black screenshots) can be found here: http://youtu.be/z_HAlENkod0\n\n\nNote: As mentioned at the end there is a way to add your own levels to the game.

Your goal is to find the exit of the maze before your food runs out.\n\nMy goal regarding the theme was to use \"alone\" in the mechanic of the game, not necessarily in the \"dressing\" of the game. There are other explorers in the maze - each of them will give you some ability, but they will also eat your food (do you will have less time to complete the maze), and they will block your way (possibly taking you to dead ends).\n\nSo, is it better to try to solve the maze alone, or ask for their help? This is a crucial decision.\n\nThere are 5 mazes in the LD48 version of the game. Even if you beat a maze, you can still try to find the minimal path.\n\nAlso, there is a secret kitten mode ;-) Let me know if you find it.\n\nThis was my first entry to Ludum Dare, and it was quite fun!\n\nCode is Java/Slick.

None of his opponent could survive under his blade. His body was immortal because he had stolen the cloak of invisibility of the Death. As a revenge, the Death cast a curse on him - not only the Death, nobody in the world could find this great warrior. Year after year, the loneliness made the warrior going crazy - now, there was only one thing left for this immortal one, fight against his spell-cloned body.\n\nThis is a First-Person fighting/action game.\n\nIMPORTANT: You need a mouse with 2 buttons(Left & Right) to play this game. Touchpad of NB is not suitable for this game.\n============\nControls\n============\n#Attack\nThe success of attack depends on if you could land it on your opponent's vulnerable bits. The enemy's vulnerabilities will be exposed when he has lost his defense stance(attacking, blocked by your shield). And there are 2 type of vulnerabilities: Far & Near(with red circle in it). Slashing attack can only reach the near vulnerabilities while piercing attack could reach both.\n##Piercing: Click with LMB(Damage: 1-3)\n##Slashing: Drag with LMB(Damage:1)\n\n#Defend\nThe enemy will attack your head, chest, or legs, so you need to position you shield at the right height while defending. When enemy begins attack, one part of the screen(upper/mid/lower) will flash red to inform you where he is targeting. Use your RMB to defend yourself as follows:\n##Shield: Hold down RMB at the red screen area.\n##Block: Hold down RMB just before the enemy's weapon reach your body! If you push RMB too early, blocking will not be triggered but you can still defend successfully.\n\n============\nHints\n============\nIf you've defeated the warrior, the attributes of him will be randomized in the next game. The \"Attack\" attribute may be a little puzzled. In this game, it means the percentage to land a power attack which could make the camera shake a lot even if you defense successfully.\n\nThis game seems quite challenging at start, until you've learned how to attack efficiently and master the art of blocking.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/9f91b7bbf9e728bae3b398754754f368.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=3035","author":{"name":"Spotlightor","uid":3035,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/21a19ce02c45dfaba263be543dd0b08c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/spotlightor/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3035-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3035-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3035-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3035-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3035-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3035-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3035-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3035-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3035-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3035-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/651996/LD%2322_WarriorCursedByLoneliness_WIN.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/651996/LD%2322_WarriorCursedByLoneliness_MAC.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://spotlightor.com/lab/unity3d/ld22"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/651996/LD%2322_WarriorCursedByLoneliness_ProjectFile.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":6,"score":4.29},{"area":"innovation","rank":34,"score":3.68},{"area":"fun","rank":70,"score":3.2},{"area":"overall","rank":100,"score":3.29},{"area":"audio","rank":180,"score":2.8},{"area":"humor","rank":306,"score":1.91},{"area":"mood","rank":365,"score":2.29},{"area":"community","rank":441,"score":2.25},{"area":"theme","rank":536,"score":2.1},{"area":"coolness","rank":685,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"You Only Help Yourself","category":"compo","description":"A mighty obstacle obstructs your path, and you cannot possibly surpass it alone.

The changes were minimal, and in the back end, and the game is functionally identical to the original submission; however, it was done post-deadline. Let me know if it goes against the rules, and I will remove the link.\n\nIn any case, Linux version on its way soon.\n\n==========\n\nThe game has been tested on Windows 7, but as with any good last-minute entry, it doesn't seem to play nice on anything other than the developer's PC. If the game doesn't run at all, or forces you to quit for not having your wireless card turned on, I apologise. Working on that presently. Do mention in the comments if you've had any errors, and provide things like error messages, and OS version.\n\nOh, and do play this on a laptop. Like, you pretty much have to.

it is quite poor. i also wanted to add a level-up that brings a new ability for each character.\n\nCONTROLS - README\nthe controls are simple but you might end up accidentally quitting and losing your progress if you don't know them (sorry). use the arrow keys and enter to select stuff. you can back out of most menus (including the quit menu) by pressing backspace. to check an enemy's hp, you can press backspace at the move/cast/wait menu and arrow over to him and press enter. esc quits the game.\n\nSTRATEGY\nthis game can be pretty hard so here's a little strategy guide. i encourage you to not read this and try to figure it out by yourself since part of the fun of a strategy game is figuring out the strategy, but if you are having trouble there are some helpful tips here. once you are familiar with the basic mechanics and how the different orbs work, it shouldn't be too hard to beat any battle with the right strategy.\n\nap (action points): when a cat's turn is up, it gets 4 ap (except the black cat, who gets 5). any ap that isn't spent during a turn will carry over to the next turn, but there is a max of 12 ap.\n\norb details: if an orb would be created/move to the point a cat is standing on, that cat will lose 1 hp. the only exception is that a cat will not be affected by its own orbs. if two orbs would both occupy the same grid space (provided there isn't a cat on it), they fizzle and are both destroyed.\n\nplaying the black cat: casting a black orb costs 2 ap. the black cat's orbs will always move one step away from her at the end of any cat's turn. the orbs can move diagonally, but only if she is standing exactly on a diagonal from the orb. if you want to get a sure hit in, end your turn with a black orb right next to the enemy cat such that it will be pushed into him immediately upon ending the turn.\n\nplaying the yellow cat: casting a yellow orb costs 1 ap per unit of distance away from your cat it is. you can read about the system the yellow orbs are based on here: http://goo.gl/QbJSC. at the end of any cat's turn, yellow orbs are created and destroyed based on these same rules. the main thing to keep in mind is that if there is an empty space next to exactly three yellow orbs (including diagonally adjacent ones), an orb will be created there. so to hit the enemy cat, all you have to do is cast yellow orbs such that he is touching no more or less than three of them at the end of your turn. one effective strategy here is to box the enemy into a corner and just keep putting orbs on the three cells next to him. also check out the example pattern sections on that wiki page, as they will work quite nicely in this game. in the beginning of my gameplay video you can see me shooting a glider at the black cat.\n\nfighting the white cat: the white cat will duplicate herself if she has any ap at the end of her turn; this is pretty hard to avoid. it costs her 5 ap to cast her aoe damage spell, so you can prevent this by being far enough away that she has to spend her ap on moving within range of you. try to separate her from her duplicate and kill them one at a time. it is rarely a good idea to move toward her, just let her come to you.\n\nfighting the purple cat: congratulations on making it this far. the purple cat has 8 hp and can be difficult to hit, but he isn't very aggressive. his orbs will take one step randomly in any of the four directions at the end of any cat's turn. if you are playing the black cat, some tricky juking may be necessary to get hits in. try turning your orbs mid-flight by walking to another side of them or to a diagonal. if you are the yellow cat, a strategy of slow advancement works well. wait until you have a lot of ap, then move in and setup a wall of orbs. if you place them well and continue to augment the wall every turn with more orbs in the right places, you can slowly advance towards your opponent and eventually corner him while preventing his orbs from reaching you.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/fdc0ea3b7ed3a07b545e166accbbb5cb.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=4975","author":{"name":"mes","uid":4975,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2821f70beac7d29a245fa6887382dff2?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/mes/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4975-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4975-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4975-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4975-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4975-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4975-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"windows","url":"http://queklain.undev.org/ld22/felinus0-win.zip"},{"label":"mac","url":"http://queklain.undev.org/ld22/felinus0-mac.zip"},{"label":"crossplatform + source (.love)","url":"http://queklain.undev.org/ld22/felinus0.love"},{"label":"gameplay video","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYWG6Xv8YPk"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":51},{"area":"innovation","rank":9,"score":3.5},{"area":"graphics","rank":32,"score":3.61},{"area":"fun","rank":37,"score":2.89},{"area":"overall","rank":37,"score":3.11},{"area":"audio","rank":50,"score":2.93},{"area":"humor","rank":58,"score":2.17},{"area":"mood","rank":92,"score":2.08},{"area":"theme","rank":111,"score":2.11},{"area":"community","rank":240,"score":2.75}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Live another day","category":"compo","description":"Hoooooorah!...

The concept is a platformer where there's AI-controlled NPCs and you have to outlast them, being the lone survivor.

You can see an early, unfunished prototype of the AI in action here: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/15658925/LD22%20release/game2.html\n\nWhat remains is a procedurally generated forced-scroll platformer where the objective is to stay on the screen in spite of the obstacles.\n\nI found and fixed a potential issue with jaws.js (which is awesome by the way, give it a try) which occurs if you try and dynamically expand the game world. I'll investigate the bug fully and then try to submit a patch, so if nothing else this weekend will have produced that :D\n\nNOTE: I tried this in Firefox and it didn't work.

The game began from an idea based on \"The Omega Man\", but it changed a little bit - so the one \"last survivor\" is now three survivors, but at least they're still \"alone\" as a collective... except for the mutants. But that's how the film works, isn't it? I don't know I've only seen the Simpsons spoof of it!\n\nAnyway, I don't care about the points, but would /really/ love some feedback. I don't know if it has potential to evolve into something bigger from here and where I could take it, so I'd really appreciate any thoughts you have :)\n\n---\n\nUse the mouse to play. Press \"R\" or \"Escape\" to reset if it gets stuck. \n\nYour objective is to get to the checkpoint, marked by a light-blue square towards the top of the map.\n\nEach turn you can move one of your guys by clicking on one of the glowing squares - these represent the squares you can move to. If there are mutants in your line-of-sight then you will have a chance to shoot one of them. Any neighbouring mutants of the same colour will also be killed.\n\nThen it will be the mutants' turn to move! If a mutant moves to a square adjacent to one of your team that team member will be killed.\n\n---\n\nKnown issues:\n - Line-of-sight isn't spot on, and probably could be made more intuitive/clear/consistent.\n - Pathfinding is sometimes wrong. But all the locations enemies go to are within their reach, even if the paths they choose sometimes go through rocks! ^^;\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c40bd5c8ed941db995ebc9a98e7d7551.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=2401","author":{"name":"Alistair Aitcheson","uid":2401,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/38498213153d8072021dee3fb7f26fd3?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/alistair-aitcheson/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/2401-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/2401-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/2401-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/2401-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/2401-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/2401-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"SWF","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11862082/AGAitchesonLD48/OmegaMen_AGA.swf"},{"label":"Browser","url":"http://www.alistairaitcheson.com/games/inprogress/LD22_OmegaMen.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11862082/AGAitchesonLD48/OmegaMen_SOURCE.zip"},{"label":"\"Making of\" video","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX__RCiGhkA"}],"ratings":[{"area":"fun","rank":39,"score":3.4},{"area":"innovation","rank":57,"score":3.44},{"area":"graphics","rank":64,"score":3.72},{"area":"overall","rank":72,"score":3.4},{"area":"community","rank":78,"score":3.29},{"area":"humor","rank":103,"score":2.71},{"area":"audio","rank":194,"score":2.73},{"area":"mood","rank":373,"score":2.28},{"area":"theme","rank":605,"score":1.88},{"area":"coolness","rank":605,"score":14}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"ROM CHECK FAIL WITHOUT A CAUSE","category":"jam","description":"With apologies to Farbs and Sergio Cornaga.\n\n(source included in windows zip)\n\nUses the source code (http://www.farbs.org/?p=696 ) to ROM CHECK FAIL made by Farbs (http://www.farbs.org) and riffs on Pac-Man Without a Cause by Sergio Cornaga.\n\nFor those that don't get the connection to the theme: the enemies have been removed, leaving the player alone and without an objective.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/31032eacdaf56064d67ce28abe257127.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=935","author":{"name":"ExciteMike","uid":935,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bd808ada78620a39b9fd4d00aded55bc?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/excitemike/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/935-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/935-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/excitemike/games/rcfwac/romcheckfailwithoutacause.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"humor","rank":30,"score":2.81},{"area":"audio","rank":114,"score":1.86},{"area":"fun","rank":117,"score":2},{"area":"innovation","rank":122,"score":1.88},{"area":"mood","rank":123,"score":1.79},{"area":"theme","rank":139,"score":1.88},{"area":"overall","rank":141,"score":2.07},{"area":"graphics","rank":153,"score":1.87},{"area":"community","rank":649,"score":1.67},{"area":"coolness","rank":685,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Sandwich Quest","category":"compo","description":"Instructions - The aim of this game is to avoid sandwich envy by only eating your sandwich when no one else is around.

I nerfed it a bit just before submitting so probably on the easy side.\n\nEDIT: I added a 800x600 version which might help people with small screens or slow graphics card.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/764eea41b4ddc0ad2370bdd05a57007d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=187","author":{"name":"Codexus","uid":187,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b0b8e10a7506005b0cc5f1902713746c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/codexus/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/187-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/187-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/187-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/187-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/187-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/187-shot2.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.codexus.com/misc/ld22/alonewithzombies-win32.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://www.codexus.com/misc/ld22/alonewithzombies-osx.zip"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhMR0KUSfUQ"},{"label":"Web (Unity player)","url":"http://www.codexus.com/misc/ld22/WebPlayer.html"},{"label":"Web (800x600)","url":"http://www.codexus.com/misc/ld22/WebPlayer800.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"mood","rank":15,"score":3.35},{"area":"theme","rank":30,"score":3.14},{"area":"graphics","rank":30,"score":3.68},{"area":"audio","rank":32,"score":3.2},{"area":"overall","rank":32,"score":3.14},{"area":"community","rank":46,"score":3.5},{"area":"fun","rank":71,"score":2.45},{"area":"humor","rank":108,"score":1.56},{"area":"innovation","rank":132,"score":1.75},{"area":"coolness","rank":376,"score":35}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Barriers","category":"jam","description":"Arrows or WASD to move.\nControl to change barrier type.\nSpacebar to drop barrier.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e2f20b34302fa6639639ac02c1071ebf.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=3269","author":{"name":"scottwashi","uid":3269,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6f697f5d90d5a396c64f932084fa8aa5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/bigcess/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3269-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3269-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3269-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3269-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3269-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3269-shot2.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://gamedevpuns.com/ludumdare/Barriers.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://gamedevpuns.com/ludumdare/WebPlayer.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":45,"score":2.86},{"area":"innovation","rank":77,"score":2.4},{"area":"humor","rank":80,"score":1.85},{"area":"fun","rank":112,"score":2.1},{"area":"mood","rank":117,"score":1.82},{"area":"audio","rank":123,"score":1.38},{"area":"graphics","rank":140,"score":2.1},{"area":"overall","rank":143,"score":2.05},{"area":"community","rank":491,"score":2.13},{"area":"coolness","rank":685,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Book Of Hyperion","category":"compo","description":"Hell, yeah, I made a gameboy styled RPG in 48 hours!!!

I wanted to make a game about exploring an abandoned space station in zero gravity. It seemed like a really lonely setting in my mind, and you would be investigating why everyone on the stationed vanished.\nIt became apparent around the midway point that I wouldn't be able to make even a simple version of that on my own in 48 hours.\n\nSo the game, appropriately, drifted a bit from my original idea. What it is now is a prototype of the kind of 2D zero-G movement I want to have. Since I was writing the game code from scratch in Processing (with the exception of the Fisica library for physics) I didn't have time to implement all the systems that would be needed for an exploration/adventure game. I spent most of my time coding the game and coding levels. So I decided to make it a simple traversal game with no story. It became less about exploration and more about figuring out how to make your character ricochet off of ungrabbable surfaces to get to the exit, which turned out to be more challenging and interesting to me than just jumping around.\n\nUnfortunately this is a little bit off-theme now. I didn't have time to make the levels look more like an abandoned space station so you're just going to have to use your imagination. :)\n\nI hope you enjoy my first Ludum Dare entry!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/54785efc714c81216e51150f59a2993f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=8628","author":{"name":"Eliot","uid":8628,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7e775b0ec0c18f8b6bb5c46c8278d5df?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/eliot/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8628-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8628-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8628-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/8628-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://eliot.s3.amazonaws.com/releases/games/ld48/ld22/Drift.windows.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://eliot.s3.amazonaws.com/releases/games/ld48/ld22/Drift.macosx.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://eliot.s3.amazonaws.com/releases/games/ld48/ld22/Drift.linux.tar.gz"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://eliot.s3.amazonaws.com/releases/games/ld48/ld22/Drift.source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"fun","rank":167,"score":2.83},{"area":"innovation","rank":202,"score":2.83},{"area":"overall","rank":401,"score":2.58},{"area":"graphics","rank":522,"score":2.08},{"area":"audio","rank":594,"score":1},{"area":"mood","rank":650,"score":1.38},{"area":"humor","rank":659,"score":1},{"area":"theme","rank":667,"score":1.58},{"area":"coolness","rank":685,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Ending

(the button will light up when you are over it)\n\nGameplay Note: You can jump higher by pulling up with the mouse, but you will be sacrificing run speed.

I tried my best so far in this one spending soooo much time to get it done. I agreed that I would do a physics game for this Ludum because everyone loves physics. The only hard part was fitting the theme into it which I got an idea for. It took me a lot of resources to make this game so I will list them here:\n-Photoshop (Huge help)\n-Mixcraft (My Audio from guitar and synth)\n-Audacity (Lowering or sound files)\n-FlashDevelop (The program for flash 'Duh')\n-FlashPunk Classes\n-Box2d physics\n-Probably more that I cant think of right now\n\nAudio: Created by mixcraft mainly. The sounds were either recorded from my guitar or a composition of notes in mixcraft\n\nGraphics: I basically used vectors and textures in PS for the graphics. This took a good portion of the time I had. The trash can especially took the longest because of 2 layers\n\nTheme: I came up with a story line sort of for the whole game. I said that you were a kid growing up with your family and your family is leaving for a Christmas party and you dont wanna go. So you stay home and you cant find anything to do. Eventually you find a bouncy ball and start playing with it and that is what the game is based off of. It continues through the different levels\n\nGamePlay:\nThe concept of the game is to do teh objective of the level, which is usually to knock down all of the blocks or get the ball into the trash can. But there is variation involved in the later levels\n-Walls\n-Red Blocks\n-Gravity\n-Stars\n-Limited bounces\n-Much more!\n\nGood luck to everyone participating in Ludum Dare 22!!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/1c28893e98ea247a0a2860206bceb7fc.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=4335","author":{"name":"Dmurph","uid":4335,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1fce2b64d6fa5cac23b48d1ac13afdaa?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/dmurph/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4335-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4335-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4335-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4335-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4335-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4335-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4335-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4335-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4335-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/4335-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web & Source","url":"http://www.netglowgames.com/games/bouncy-balls "},{"label":"Trailer(YouTube)","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6Xp6A3CxWM&feature=youtube_gdata"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":71},{"area":"audio","rank":42,"score":3.4},{"area":"fun","rank":74,"score":3.19},{"area":"overall","rank":216,"score":2.96},{"area":"graphics","rank":258,"score":2.88},{"area":"humor","rank":371,"score":1.74},{"area":"innovation","rank":376,"score":2.35},{"area":"mood","rank":518,"score":1.82},{"area":"community","rank":519,"score":2},{"area":"theme","rank":646,"score":1.67}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Circle","category":"compo","description":"Circle for Ludum Dare 22, by RichMakeGame\nwww.richmakegame.com\n[email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */\ntwitter: #RichMakeGame\n\ncontrols:\n\n+ and - change mouse sensitivity\nwasd- move\nspace - jump\nleft mouse - throw stone\n\n\nNOTE- I didn't fully get to finish the game I'm afraid, after a certain point the game will loop back to the beginning.

I was going to wait until judgind ends... but I can't help but really want to update the game. >_<\nNext time I'll just upload it to dropbox from the start...[/EDIT]","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b171f638cd06aa785f2e6ec4745d9a2f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=7375","author":{"name":"GFM","uid":7375,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/603a551378483961b3bc8e17a3e90bfe?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/gfm/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7375-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7375-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7375-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7375-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/55733901/LD48/ld22/LD22_GFM_Loneliness_compoVersion.swf"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.4shared.com/file/GdP8RJRR/alone.html"},{"label":"Postcompo","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/55733901/LD48/ld22/LD22_GFM.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":88},{"area":"audio","rank":332,"score":2.25},{"area":"innovation","rank":387,"score":2.32},{"area":"graphics","rank":437,"score":2.33},{"area":"mood","rank":438,"score":2},{"area":"humor","rank":465,"score":1.55},{"area":"community","rank":514,"score":2.06},{"area":"fun","rank":535,"score":1.91},{"area":"theme","rank":557,"score":2.03},{"area":"overall","rank":585,"score":2.11}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"LUDUM DARODIUS","category":"compo","description":"LUDUM DARODIUS\n---------------------------------------------\n\nChicky is around again!

I made a Universal package, but if you need something specific, just leave a word in the coments.\n\nSorry for Linux-only users, Unity doesn't provide Linux binaries. I'll try to confirm on my PC if the game works in Wine.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/db4006115ff664bd6ce46e63d7181730.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=7209","author":{"name":"89cookies","uid":7209,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4303cd8882bb31af5bb45bf2dd4f1b98?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/89cookies/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7209-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7209-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/36540510/Alone_In_His_Mind.zip"},{"label":"OS/X Universal","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/36540510/Alone_In_His_Mind_MacUniversal.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":215,"score":2.8},{"area":"mood","rank":479,"score":1.91},{"area":"innovation","rank":479,"score":2.08},{"area":"coolness","rank":483,"score":26},{"area":"graphics","rank":501,"score":2.17},{"area":"audio","rank":502,"score":1.4},{"area":"theme","rank":510,"score":2.17},{"area":"overall","rank":589,"score":2.08},{"area":"fun","rank":604,"score":1.67}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Alone In Space","category":"jam","description":"Alone in Space is a suspenseful tile based adventure game, developed by two-man Bombsight Games for this competition. \n\nAs the only surviving crewman of FFG-1 Montgomery, evade the hostile entity and get to the ship's last escape pod!\n\nEnjoy!

you...\nWhere your only weapons are a sword, and a pair of glasses...\n\nIsolated Assault\n\nThis 48 hour game was meant to implement the theme, alone, in a new way--you're alone in a cube wasteland until you put on the sunglasses. \n\nThe sunglasses make you see things. Enemies. That must be destroyed. \n\nIf you can find a shaded zone, (a small building or overhang) you can take off your glasses, making the enemies disappear, and regenerate your health. But, you can't stay there forever. You have a chopper to catch! \n\nThe longer you take to find the chopper, the more enemies appear, and the harder it will be to find. It's easy to get lost, so just try to find the shaded zones. \n\nREAD THE README.RTF FOR MORE (Controls, hints, humor, etc.)\n\nThis is my first Ludum Dare Entry, and I'm exciting to finally be doing this! Good luck to all, and thanks for playing!\n\nTimelapse here: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/53757030/TimelapseCompressed.mov\n\n(Right click and \"Save Link as\" if you want a download)\n\nI get distracted a lot... Oh and you may want to go full-screen to see what applications I'm using. \n\nThere's web version... if you really want it. There are several bugs, it's quite laggy, and the opening menu text is completely ruined. \n\nIf you really want to play without a download, let me know in the comments, and I'll post a link, just be prepared for a confusing menu. (The upper left corner blocks is the \"Play\" button, the lower right is \"Quit\", and the lower left is instructions.)\n\nPost-Mortem here: http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2011/12/21/isolated-assault-post-mortem/\n\nGameplay video: \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVjZnsU1BLA","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d5cc4a31c2d105c7cee9cf2f9b9e1ef3.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=7405","author":{"name":"RobProductions","uid":7405,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/89648c1019679041b7fb111cbbcb36e7?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/someguy22/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7405-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7405-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7405-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7405-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7405-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7405-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7405-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7405-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7405-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/7405-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/53757030/IsolatedAssaultWindows1.4.zip"},{"label":"Mac OS/X Intel","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/53757030/IsolatedAssaultMacIntel1.4.zip"},{"label":"Mac OS/X Universal","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/53757030/IsolatedAssaultMacUniversal1.4.zip"},{"label":"Windows 64 bit","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/53757030/IsolatedAssaultWindows64Bit1.4.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/53757030/LD22.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":52},{"area":"community","rank":40,"score":3.55},{"area":"innovation","rank":108,"score":3.2},{"area":"mood","rank":113,"score":3.2},{"area":"audio","rank":118,"score":3},{"area":"theme","rank":133,"score":3.33},{"area":"humor","rank":202,"score":2.29},{"area":"graphics","rank":323,"score":2.67},{"area":"overall","rank":435,"score":2.5},{"area":"fun","rank":487,"score":2.06}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Leave me Alone!!!","category":"compo","description":"The idea of the game is to isolate (maintain alone) the main particle from the other particles keep the world alive from a great hyper mega explosion!!!\n\nThe game was made using Artemis, Box2D, LibGDX and LWJGL.\n\nInstructions:\n\nMove the main particle with the mouse, dodge green and blue particles.

One dark and rainy day he was sitting in the tavern \"Mug of hero\", sinking his miserable life in alcohol as usual.\n\nWhen he finally lost count of how much ale he has drank his blurry attention was captured by a  strange conversation.

And, as a nice side bonus, the King promised her hand and a little bit more than a half of the kingdom to the savior.\n\nAll in sudden the knight realised that the princess would fill the gap in his miserable life or at least cook and more. Thus, after a few days of hangover, he took his licheny wooden sword and faithful wooden horse and marched to meet his destiny. \n\n\n\nGame is made on HtmL5 + javascript.\nBest to play on google Chrome or Mozzila Firefox.\n\nWe made the entire game from scratch in 72 hours. \nIncluding all the coding, scripting, login and account system, images, models and storyline.\n\n\nHope you like it ! \n\nMade by Paulius Rumsa, \nMaxim Solovjov \nand Justinas Sneideris.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/61c1e71e258065e33fbfbada6cc0ca46.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=3215","author":{"name":"Slapunas","uid":3215,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/932638ba9a579f3c51c507d63c1dfb0f?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/slapunas/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3215-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3215-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3215-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3215-shot1.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3215-shot2.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3215-shot2.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3215-shot3.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3215-shot3.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3215-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/3215-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://lknight.x10.mx/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"humor","rank":25,"score":2.93},{"area":"graphics","rank":35,"score":3.59},{"area":"fun","rank":65,"score":2.53},{"area":"overall","rank":73,"score":2.69},{"area":"innovation","rank":78,"score":2.38},{"area":"mood","rank":97,"score":2},{"area":"theme","rank":118,"score":2.06},{"area":"audio","rank":136,"score":1.14},{"area":"coolness","rank":685,"score":0},{"area":"community","rank":716,"score":1.4}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Unknown Receiver ","category":"compo","description":"A message have been transmitted on Earth, two young men must decrypt the message through a program they designed.\nHelp them on six levels and you shall get your answer.\n\nI made it with C++ Builder\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ab9772d5555b2b919d65815c000605c5.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=6070","author":{"name":"skyazid","uid":6070,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b86d5ffbf1c696920f4681f7663bae83?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/skyazid/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/6070-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/6070-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/6070-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/87574/6070-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/53807408/Unknown%20Receiver.7z"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/53807408/Source.7z"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":393,"score":2.31},{"area":"overall","rank":448,"score":2.46},{"area":"fun","rank":466,"score":2.08},{"area":"graphics","rank":484,"score":2.23},{"area":"audio","rank":498,"score":1.43},{"area":"theme","rank":561,"score":2},{"area":"mood","rank":609,"score":1.5},{"area":"coolness","rank":685,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":22,"title":"Zombie Street","category":"compo","description":"Top-Down-Shooter, without guns.

If you get stress to much, then you going mad and the game ends. Try drinking water to calm down. It's good to solve hydratation problem too, but it will raise bladder bar. Similarly if you getting tired you fall asleep. This is why you have coffee in the desk. Click it. If it's empty, then you can make another dose by clicking it once more. The game ends when hydratation goes too low or bladder goes too high so maintain them as well. You can go to toilet by clicking in the bladder stat area.\n\n(The following isn't implemented yet... :( )\nWhen going to toilet or making coffee, you can encounter ghosts and hallucinations that raises stress.
