My first Ludum Dare Entry. I used the theme as game name throughout development and now I'm too lazy to change that so I just called it Tiny World with my username as prefix.\n\nControls:\n- Left&Right for horizontal movement and Up/Space for jumping.\n- Escape to go back to world overview or quit game.\n- Return to enter selected world in world overview screen.\n\nOn Android tap on the left/right border of the screen to run left/right and tap both left&right borders at the same time for jumping. Press the back button on your device to return to the world overview.\n\nDifficulty:\nEasy -> small inertia, no spikes\nNormal, Hard, Impossible -> growing inertia, with spikes.\n\nThe jar should run fine on all desktops (Win/Mac/Linux) with a Java VM installed.\n\nWeb&Android ports were done after the compo. The web version should run on recent versions of Firefox and Chrome.  Android version was only tested on my HTC Desire so far. Hopefully works more or less on other devices.\n\nSince I couldn't come up with a great idea to fit the theme I just used a small planet as a level/world overview as rationale/excuse. The game itself is quite hard (maybe not in a good way) and the controls are erratic to say the least.\n\nI also put the source on bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/0x17/tinyworld\n\nNot sure if I'll write a postmortem. :-D","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/1c30eebe6e92ef48c11d4ed1d703cc09.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=4765","author":{"name":"0x17","uid":4765,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e66e9d87171fd68ef38753f643c68c27?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/0x17/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4765-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4765-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4765-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4765-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4765-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4765-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4765-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4765-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows/OSX/Linux","url":"http://steinkraft.net/downloads/LD23-0x17-TinyWorld.jar"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://tinyworld0x17.appspot.com/"},{"label":"Android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andreschnabel.tinyworld"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://steinkraft.net/downloads/TinyWorldSrc.zip"},{"label":"Video","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Quku9ekW7Q"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":66},{"area":"mood","rank":486,"score":2.61},{"area":"audio","rank":486,"score":2.34},{"area":"humor","rank":528,"score":2.06},{"area":"fun","rank":531,"score":2.64},{"area":"overall","rank":604,"score":2.7},{"area":"innovation","rank":722,"score":2.28},{"area":"graphics","rank":723,"score":2.31},{"area":"theme","rank":815,"score":2.1}],"platforms":["desktop","java","web","mobile"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"9Lives","category":"jam","description":"9Lives is a game that follows the story of Cary the Cat who wakes up to find that his love Kitie has gone missing.  Along his journey Cary goes through many different environments and encounters many different obstacles.  You play as Cary in this pixelated adventure, there are some cool cats as you go along, so be sure to talk to them especially if you believe you are stuck.\n\nThis game was developed by The Gaming Project which consists of four members, we worked as much as we could over the three days, but school and work took up some of our precious work time.\n\nThe games Protagonist Cary and his love Kitie are based on two of our friends in real life who are about to get married, we made this game as a birthday present to the real Cary.  All eight cats (and the one dog) are also all based on pets of our friends.  It was an extremely fun project and we hope everyone who plays it enjoys it.\n\nThe game was coded in HTML5 which is new for us so not everything is as smooth as it could be.  We plan over the next few days to polish up the game and extend it some more.  In addition we plan to make the sound work on all browsers, currently it does not work on Safari or Internet Explorer.  Below a link to the background music is provided if you are interested.\n\nPlease let us know what you think and enjoy.\n\n***Yes the game is very small, you can zoom in with your browser if it helps.***","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/521ba4df83c2e00258aefded4bfefe83.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=10740","author":{"name":"TheGamingProject","uid":10740,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9dc9e7ceb9e341bb7248f523b0a7fdb1?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/thegamingproject/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10740-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10740-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10740-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10740-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://thegamingproject.org/webgames/ludumdare23/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://thegamingproject.org/webgames/ludumdare23_src.zip"},{"label":"Music","url":"http://inudge.net/#/2jytp"},{"label":"Timelapse (art)","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S4HnaQUuag"},{"label":"Timelapse (code)","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csc4U0fFLk8&feature=channel&list=UL"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":87},{"area":"mood","rank":52,"score":3.37},{"area":"innovation","rank":71,"score":3.36},{"area":"theme","rank":81,"score":3.26},{"area":"audio","rank":83,"score":3.19},{"area":"humor","rank":96,"score":2.61},{"area":"overall","rank":113,"score":3.13},{"area":"fun","rank":120,"score":2.81},{"area":"graphics","rank":129,"score":3.25}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"A World for Me","category":"compo","description":"I feel this was a good first LD.

It was my first participation to LD =)\n\nI used Java, Eclipse and Gimp.\n\nThanks to ra4king for letting me use his server.\n\nTwitter : @Chtulhu1\n\nThanks for writting me some comment.

I just had no way to test it. xD\n\nPremise-\nAn Idea is a world in and of itself. It's afloat in the universe, caught on a breeze, growing large only to be destroyed (Except in certain circumstances). It inspires souls to its side and often conflicts with others.\n\nThe conflict between the ideas is meant to bring home the 'Tiny World' view point of ideas. While at war, more 'Military' type units were meant to spawn (Unimplemented), enough so that the other three unit types would almost be choked out.\n\nWhile it would take a lot of balancing, the game favors the player when you have a smaller map. The closer to 37 tiles (Half that's displayed) the higher your chance to spawn a unit each turn. Further, the intent was that when you're not at war with another Idea, you can 'destroy' portions of the world, and if you split the map, the parts not linked to you disappear, reducing the map size.\n\nSuccess-\nLimited. While I got much of what I had wanted to get through done, I didn't complete enough to actually call what I created a game. While you can -do- things in it, it's missing a bunch of functions that would make it -playable-.\n\nHUD From top-\nLeft 1: Number- Your total belief, spent to do things.\nLeft 2: Y->T looking thing- Toggles and allows you to randomly place a tile on that spot.\nLeft 3: * Looking thing- Toggles and allows you to destroy an uninhabited tile, due to the lack of a path-finder, this can break movement.\nLeft 4: Obelisk with waves- Attempts to convert all 'neutral (Yellow)' things on the map (20 Belief for each yellow, with 4x your spawn chance for each).\nLeft 5: Dead Tree- Opens up a refinements/tech menu (Obelisk lets you get belief faster, Heart heals your units/structures more per turn, Sword increases unit damage, Wispy flame increases pop cap) each costs 200 Belief.\nLeft 6: ?- Toggles and was meant to provide info about all of the other parts of the HUD.\nLeft 7: Hourglass- End your turn.\nTop 1: Population Current/Max\nTop 2: Spawn chance\nTop 3: Number of Blank (Little fire) souls. Can become any other type of soul.\nTop 4: Number of Artistic (Candle) souls. Passively increases Belief, Healing and Damage.\nTop 5: Number of Creative (Compass) souls. Can work in a structure and increase its output by 50%.\nTop 6: Number of Convincing (Sword) souls. Moves to the closest non-friendly structure and attempts to destroy it.\nTop 7: Number of Obstinate (Shield) souls. Attacks any non-friendly Soul on a tile you own.\n\nClicking a tile, when not changing/destroying, pops up a blank window which was meant to display information about a structure (In use, training, health, owner). I just didn't have to time to implement it.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/0a7a1bce41585f879f2885e4af60a72a.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=10562","author":{"name":"uprightpath","uid":10562,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5720145d9f00ff4a482421c392caf53b?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/uprightpath/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10562-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10562-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxU9WNXSMwYPYlBicG5xYWxXbzQ"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxU9WNXSMwYPYlBicG5xYWxXbzQ"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":71},{"area":"innovation","rank":492,"score":2.8},{"area":"graphics","rank":691,"score":2.38},{"area":"audio","rank":772,"score":1.11},{"area":"humor","rank":785,"score":1.33},{"area":"theme","rank":787,"score":2.2},{"area":"mood","rank":803,"score":1.96},{"area":"overall","rank":880,"score":1.85},{"area":"fun","rank":892,"score":1.39}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Tiny Zombyz","category":"compo","description":"","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a48776f50d4e2f2a55de233e4130e036.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=6814","author":{"name":"Ados200102","uid":6814,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/65c019db105bd8aca056dddf5f372997?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/ados200102/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/6814-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/6814-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.box.com/s/d176be97ba48acf2c5b7"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://www.box.com/s/d176be97ba48acf2c5b7"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://www.box.com/s/d176be97ba48acf2c5b7"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://www.box.com/s/759ddcef3353e20ebb99"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1120,"score":10}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"TinyBot","category":"jam","description":"*** TinyBot\t*** v1.0\n\nGuide your TinyBot through a strange little world to save a scientist.\n\n=== CONTROLS ===\nWASD/Arrows     TO MOVE\nRIGHT CTRL/Z    TO JUMP\nRIGHT SHIFT/X   TO SHOOT  (hold UP to shoot up)\nESC             GAME MENU (during game)\n\nGame made by Murilo \nMusic/Sfx by Sary Ishii\n\nUse mouse for menu options.\n\nEnjoy!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/cae813437416fdd45cd65213135a06dd.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=6882","author":{"name":"murilo","uid":6882,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/38fae3ccc9691bd0be276763b2e3d9dd?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/murilo/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/6882-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/6882-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?uve9soa2aaabga6"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":72},{"area":"theme","rank":31,"score":3.65},{"area":"humor","rank":104,"score":2.53},{"area":"mood","rank":110,"score":2.91},{"area":"overall","rank":122,"score":3.08},{"area":"fun","rank":129,"score":2.75},{"area":"graphics","rank":129,"score":3.25},{"area":"audio","rank":137,"score":2.76},{"area":"innovation","rank":188,"score":2.45}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Tondie and Zupe","category":"compo","description":"Requries an HTML5 capable browser.

If you're stuck, here's some tips:\n * You start the game able to double jump (jump in the air), and you can upgrade it later.\n * At the beginning, collect money to advance the game. When you reach $250, you get the ability to grow. After that, keep growing to advance the game.\n * Grow will only work if you have 90/100 health or higher.\n * You have to be standing at the base of a structure to upgrade it.\n * The final boss has a pretty small hit box, right in the middle of its dome. Attack from above and try to hit it right in the center. Launchers upgraded about 6 times are excellent for getting up there.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/17129d181554457a96b4d10233157b84.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=1151","author":{"name":"Cosmologicon","uid":1151,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1ec36bd1e52f952273345b3012b34430?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/cosmologicon/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1151-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1151-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1151-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1151-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1151-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1151-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows | Linux | OS/X | Web (HTML5)","url":"http://christophernight.net/tondie/v1"},{"label":"postmortem","url":"http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/04/25/tondie-and-zupe-postmortem-1-process/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"fun","rank":14,"score":3.96},{"area":"theme","rank":24,"score":4.1},{"area":"overall","rank":30,"score":3.94},{"area":"mood","rank":61,"score":3.54},{"area":"innovation","rank":100,"score":3.71},{"area":"humor","rank":169,"score":2.85},{"area":"graphics","rank":186,"score":3.47},{"area":"audio","rank":670,"score":1.78}],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux","mac","web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Tooth Fairy Fun Time","category":"compo","description":"As the tooth fairy it is your job to collect teeth and bring them to your home base.

Use rocket jumps to reach places that have never been reached before!\n\nAlso features a menu, with fully customizable keybinds (overloadable to up to 3 keys per action!), the option to invert both mouse axes, volume control, and a FOV slider! It might be tempting to increase the FOV, but this game is played best with the default FOV. Still, if you're beyond pro quake level, set it to 140 for maximum fisheye\n\nEnjoy!

At the moment it fixes the teleport bug, but nothing major.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ae967f4076f88e55ec15699945cbae88.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=3501","author":{"name":"natpat","uid":3501,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c0a15dc1a1efb0a5fb9be36c8a96460b?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/natpat/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3501-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3501-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3501-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3501-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://natpat.net/games/ludumdare/LD23"},{"label":"Web (post-compo)","url":"http://natpat.net/games/revolves"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-sNDTVbapI"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":52,"score":3.5},{"area":"fun","rank":97,"score":2.94},{"area":"theme","rank":159,"score":2.78},{"area":"overall","rank":175,"score":2.72},{"area":"mood","rank":200,"score":2.24},{"area":"humor","rank":221,"score":1.45},{"area":"graphics","rank":225,"score":2.28},{"area":"coolness","rank":897,"score":30}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Slime Mold","category":"compo","description":"Dont let the little pesky slime molds combine!!! \n\nclick to start.\n\nclick and drag the mouse to push the slime molds.\n\nthe game is rubbish really.. i started way too late\nand spent FAR too much time on the music/gfx..\n\ni do like the gfx and music tho ;p\n\nits all about the taking part and community for me anyhoot :)\n\nhowieV (binary_girl)\n:)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/672e77c64ecb1114c73fb9d9ace76169.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=8824","author":{"name":"binary_girl","uid":8824,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c5208a400b612feec792c3ba2ea912f5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/binary_girl/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8824-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8824-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8824-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8824-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://binary-girl.comli.com/slimemold/slimemold.html"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://binary-girl.comli.com/slimemold/slimemold.html"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://binary-girl.comli.com/slimemold/slimemold.html"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://binary-girl.comli.com/slimemold/slimemold.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://binary-girl.comli.com/slimemold/slimemold.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":75},{"area":"audio","rank":8,"score":4.12},{"area":"mood","rank":32,"score":3.73},{"area":"graphics","rank":164,"score":3.55},{"area":"theme","rank":393,"score":3.12},{"area":"innovation","rank":636,"score":2.51},{"area":"humor","rank":745,"score":1.53},{"area":"overall","rank":782,"score":2.38},{"area":"fun","rank":864,"score":1.72}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"The Little Planet","category":"compo","description":"The Little Planet a game about finding secrets.

I had the time to spend pretty much all weekend on my game, with breaks for sleeping and eating.\n\nI had my idea pretty early on, luckily. Unluckily, it was an action adventure game, and every time I've tried to make one of those I didn't finish much of the story. This LD was no exception--the ending is quite abrupt.\n\nHowever, I still think it's possible to enjoy this game, short as it is.\n\n\n----Controls----\n\n- WASD for movement\n- Click on dialogue to advance\n- Click on doors to unlock\n- Click and hold to shoot once you have the gun\n\n\n----Background----\n\nThe in-game story may be a bit confusing because of the format I had to relay it in. I also wrote the dialogues all out of order, so they aren't even very well-planned.\n\nThis tiny world, Drop, is contained within a drop of rain. Its people live in hyperaccelerated time, so much like how each human's life in the universe's lifespan is insignificant, each *'s lifetime is insignificant to the Drop.\n\nRecently, Drop has merged with another water droplet, causing a nasty war between their inhabitants. Worse than this is an apocalypse--Drop is falling dangerously close to the ground.\n\nIt is hopeful legend that a hero will propel Drop back into the Clouds, to allow it to survive for the length of another fall. Guess who that is?\n\n\n----Supported platforms----\n\nThis section includes some keywords for people who search for their preferred platform to find games to play.\nWindows, Mac OS X, Linux, or anything else with Flash Player.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/110ba62b4b3de30faf5f77e73754ff4d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=1712","author":{"name":"the31","uid":1712,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7e2b7c885cfa6c044bd14500052d2060?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/31eee384/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1712-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1712-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1712-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1712-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1712-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1712-shot2.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1712-shot3.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1712-shot3.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1712-shot4.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1712-shot4.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Play on Web (Flash)","url":"http://galacticgaming.net/hosting/ld23/"},{"label":"Source (game)","url":"https://github.com/31/Hero-of-Rain"},{"label":"Source (basecode)","url":"https://github.com/31/Statework"},{"label":"Playthrough (Youtube)","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leZi1LZ4koU"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":72},{"area":"overall","rank":48,"score":3.82},{"area":"mood","rank":50,"score":3.64},{"area":"fun","rank":69,"score":3.58},{"area":"audio","rank":90,"score":3.45},{"area":"humor","rank":183,"score":2.82},{"area":"theme","rank":236,"score":3.4},{"area":"graphics","rank":243,"score":3.31},{"area":"innovation","rank":379,"score":3.05}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Immunity","category":"jam","description":"REQUIRES JAVA 5, BUT MAY REQUIRE JAVA 7 FOR SOME PLATFORMS.\nYou can get it at: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html\n\nIf the loading screen hangs and the window cannot be closed, try downloading Java 1.7.\n\nMade by the near-future 1UP Game Making Club of the University of Mary Washington.

The player can be inside a single world at the time, but she can jump from world to world if they are adjacent *and* the landscape matches.  If for example, a world has a ladder going down, then the world at bottom must have a ladder going up if the player wants to move from one to the other (and viceversa)\n\nHowever, you can't control the player directly.  Instead the player's character goes back and forth between the limits of the world--either a single card or a combination or cards correctly arranged that forms a \"bigger\" world--she is confined in.  Howerver, the player can swap two cards on the screen that have neither an object nor a character, be it the player's character or any other of the characters that are wandering around the level. \n\nEven the game's window looks like a card of sorts, althought this is more a side effect of trying to fit the game in my Android phone.  However, I think it fits the theme, specially if you have a large resolution, because the window looks so tiny...\n\n \nI didn't have time to create many levels--5 to be exact--and they aren't very challenging.  I guess it takes much more than I have to make puzzles.\n\nI couldn't test extensively the Windows version as I only have a VM and the Linux binaries \"work on my system\", but I can't guarante that they will work everywhere (64-bit was build under Gentoo and 32-bit in Debian testing.)   The Android build works at least on my tablet and phone.\n\nThe music was made with Greasymonkey's autotracker, so I don't claim credit and I don't think it would be fair to rate it.  I tried to use a custom \"autotracker\" that I did sometime ago, but didn't produce the same kind of quality.  Most sound effects were made with sfxr, except for the sound that the cards do when are swapped; this one was made with a broom.\n\nI tried, and failed miserably, to have a look-and-feel reminiscent of GB, partly because I thought that maybe my lack of artistic skills wouldn't be that noticeable.  Oh, boy... how wrong I was!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/1acd0ed757e34a9c68d9c3a59a03fa87.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=1885","author":{"name":"summaky","uid":1885,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ec95920e85d9a6a0e57a81235bee6e8b?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/summaky/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1885-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1885-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1885-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1885-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1885-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1885-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1885-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1885-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1885-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1885-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.geishastudios.com/download/ld23-summaky.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://www.geishastudios.com/download/ld23-summaky.dmg"},{"label":"Linux (64- and 32-bit)","url":"http://www.geishastudios.com/download/ld23-summaky-bin.tar.bz2"},{"label":"Android","url":"http://www.geishastudios.com/download/ld23-summaky.apk"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.geishastudios.com/download/ld23-summaky.tar.bz2"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"fun","rank":31,"score":3.79},{"area":"innovation","rank":38,"score":3.99},{"area":"overall","rank":45,"score":3.83},{"area":"mood","rank":164,"score":3.19},{"area":"audio","rank":203,"score":3.05},{"area":"graphics","rank":243,"score":3.31},{"area":"theme","rank":264,"score":3.33},{"area":"humor","rank":426,"score":2.22}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","mobile"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"A Theft of Mass","category":"compo","description":"Greetings Planetary Assassin!\n\nUse the WASD keys, Arrows, or Number Pad to maneuver your ship and your mouse to fire your mining laser as you burrow to the core of this unsuspecting planet.\nOnce it loses the mass of its core it will be tiny indeed, and destined to spiral into fiery oblivion.\n\nGraphics were created with Gimp.\n\nSounds were created with SFXR and Audacity.\n\nThe code was written in nano.\n\nThe language and build environment was Flex SDK and make.\n\nI hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a1b00272fcf22b2068209adf45592e0c.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=10893","author":{"name":"uberneen","uid":10893,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/286050ba89056b9a907df49792d8f946?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/uberneen/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10893-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10893-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10893-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10893-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10893-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10893-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web / Flash","url":"http://midian.homelinux.net/a_theft_of_mass.swf"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://midian.homelinux.net/atheftofmass.tar.gz"},{"label":"Bugfix Version","url":"http://midian.homelinux.net/a_theft_of_mass_post_compo.swf"},{"label":"Post-Mortem","url":"http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/04/25/a-theft-of-mass-post-mortem/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"innovation","rank":485,"score":2.81},{"area":"overall","rank":508,"score":2.84},{"area":"fun","rank":531,"score":2.64},{"area":"graphics","rank":597,"score":2.57},{"area":"audio","rank":626,"score":1.93},{"area":"humor","rank":638,"score":1.83},{"area":"mood","rank":672,"score":2.29},{"area":"theme","rank":815,"score":2.1}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Ayond","category":"jam","description":"For seven days, the world only lives around you...\n\n\n\nIt's our very first LD Jam.\nWe were not able to do whatever we wanted and many things are still missing, but the game is playable.\n\nMissing: the percentage of space preserved indicating the goal of the game.

I hope to rewrite this in java so that it will run on more platforms.\n\nMy twitter: https://twitter.com/#!/skyboy49707","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c98291ad2bc45c88b6afca14ce94db24.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=1802","author":{"name":"skyboy49707","uid":1802,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7c0e0217a1ab03fe8aa763bd34207902?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/skyboy49707/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1802-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1802-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4823180/Stage%202%20Chaos.exe"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4823180/LD23.gmk"}],"ratings":[{"area":"fun","rank":398,"score":2.88},{"area":"mood","rank":404,"score":2.72},{"area":"overall","rank":430,"score":2.96},{"area":"graphics","rank":557,"score":2.65},{"area":"theme","rank":565,"score":2.75},{"area":"audio","rank":620,"score":1.95},{"area":"coolness","rank":651,"score":48},{"area":"humor","rank":678,"score":1.73},{"area":"innovation","rank":804,"score":2.04}],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"The Last Ride Home","category":"compo","description":"It's a driving game where you have to outrun the exploding world to make it to the next world.\n\nEach world gets harder, faster, and more narrow.\n\nSound only works in chrome browser.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/24e2d8ce84949baa88833f332479b35e.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=7708","author":{"name":"orunbot","uid":7708,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/438ad36c224e6c20cb5b0b93d8d32a23?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/orunbot/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7708-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7708-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7708-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7708-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (Chrome for Sound)","url":"http://lazorun.com/oruncode/linedriver/"},{"label":"Youtube","url":"http://youtu.be/Qw5FGjHclYw"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/31197814/The%20Last%20Ride%20Home.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"fun","rank":87,"score":3.53},{"area":"overall","rank":410,"score":3},{"area":"mood","rank":410,"score":2.71},{"area":"humor","rank":499,"score":2.11},{"area":"innovation","rank":530,"score":2.71},{"area":"audio","rank":584,"score":2.08},{"area":"graphics","rank":748,"score":2.24},{"area":"theme","rank":894,"score":1.53},{"area":"coolness","rank":980,"score":22}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Three Trials","category":"compo","description":"A man on a flying vessel makes unwanted stop on a small planetoid.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nI have used 3rd party music.

Man am I glad this is over! LOL! I learned so much making this game. I hope you all enjoy it.\n\nThe premise is this. Viruses have infected humans and being the adventurous scientist you are, you devised a way to eradicate them. You built a special submarine, which when shrunken to microscopic size, will be injected into the infected human. You'll maneuver your sub through the blood stream, and fire your specialized laser, which you also created, kill all viruses you come into contact with. You'll need to fly through the whole body to make sure you get them all. \n\nGood Luck to all who dare enter this Tiny World!\n\n\nArrow Keys to move\nSpace to fire\nM to mute music \nU to unmute music\n\nEasy Mode - Red Blood Cells will not hurt you. Those are the bright red diamond-looking things.\n\nHard Mode - Red Blood Cells WILL hurt you.\n\nFeedback is always welcomed!\n\n\nNote:I'm no beethoven, so don't expect good music lol. It worked in a pinch though. Recommend muting music. You have been warned *giggle*\n\nNote 2: It has come to my attention that there are 2 bugs in my game. The first one is when you die and restart the game your instantly killed. The second one deals with starting the game in hard mode and instantly dying. I have fixed these in my offline version but can't upload it to be judged. So I will tell you work arounds for them. \n\nThe first one is easy, if you get to the game over screen that tells you that you lost, just close the browser and open it again.\n\nFor the second one, when you choose 2 for hard mode make sure you press x before any of the bright red blood cells are down near the bottom of the screen.\n\nI really can't believe I missed those in my play testing.\n \nNote 3: Uploaded a bugfix version. \n- Fixed Hard Mode Insta-death\n- Fixed Starting the game again after losing\n- Added Auto-Fire","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b8b5ff13658efcc4a155b4d4bad2e820.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=6464","author":{"name":"KunoNoOni","uid":6464,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/66939357d6de2a9fee4036a08e714ad1?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/kunonooni/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/6464-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/6464-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (Flash)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/53747017/Tiny%20Defender/TinyDefender.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/KunoNoOni/Tiny-Defender"},{"label":"Web(Flash)(Bugfix)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/53747017/Tiny%20Defender/bugfix/TinyDefender.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"audio","rank":433,"score":2.47},{"area":"theme","rank":443,"score":3.02},{"area":"graphics","rank":535,"score":2.72},{"area":"overall","rank":556,"score":2.77},{"area":"fun","rank":564,"score":2.58},{"area":"mood","rank":595,"score":2.43},{"area":"humor","rank":597,"score":1.91},{"area":"innovation","rank":874,"score":1.74}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Tiny God wants a Bigger World","category":"compo","description":"You are Tiny God, Lord of a Tiny World.

This base code is mainly found in:\nld23.game.Game (setup code)\nld23.game.Input\nld23.player.Camera\nld23.sound.SoundEffect","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b422febb22c9c4c38895fe192e0a9367.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=12336","author":{"name":"ThePrevenge","uid":12336,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/04dbc189dfda4ca67d302c477e6114a1?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/theprevenge/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12336-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12336-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12336-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12336-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12336-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12336-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows/Mac OS X/Linux(?)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/75004967/QuestForMatter.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/75004967/QuestForMatterSource.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"audio","rank":622,"score":1.94},{"area":"fun","rank":663,"score":2.39},{"area":"innovation","rank":722,"score":2.28},{"area":"graphics","rank":731,"score":2.28},{"area":"theme","rank":747,"score":2.33},{"area":"humor","rank":748,"score":1.5},{"area":"overall","rank":811,"score":2.28},{"area":"mood","rank":832,"score":1.85},{"area":"coolness","rank":913,"score":28}],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Rat Conquest","category":"compo","description":"Java-Applet\n\nMy first game and my first Ludum Dare ;) Thanks for playing!\n\nTools used: \n- Paint.Net + Animation-Plugin\n- Bfxr / Aviary Music Creator (http://advanced.aviary.com/)\n- Eclipse / Java 1.6\n\nThe game:\n- Arrow-Keys to move\n- You can grow, if you eat, but you can only eat enemies of your size","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/5a672c42c765256fd5c53e000a80bbb8.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=9578","author":{"name":"Canard Sauvage","uid":9578,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b9d28010db19fd144464715580fac810?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/waschnick/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/9578-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/9578-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/9578-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/9578-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/9578-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/9578-shot2.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://ld23.waschnick.de/rat-conquest-ld23.jar"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://ld23.waschnick.de/rat-conquest-ld23.jar"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://ld23.waschnick.de/rat-conquest-ld23.jar"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://ld23.waschnick.de/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://ld23.waschnick.de/ld23-src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":87},{"area":"graphics","rank":311,"score":3.13},{"area":"humor","rank":320,"score":2.45},{"area":"mood","rank":449,"score":2.66},{"area":"audio","rank":500,"score":2.3},{"area":"overall","rank":535,"score":2.8},{"area":"fun","rank":548,"score":2.61},{"area":"innovation","rank":603,"score":2.57},{"area":"theme","rank":621,"score":2.62}],"platforms":["desktop","java","web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"sailboatboatboat","category":"compo","description":"A rogue-like with boats and pirates and fishing and stuff.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/21f492198dc8d45191a23bdf2f89d8ca.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=7269","author":{"name":"prettymuchbryce","uid":7269,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b40273f2a0d78ea6c271e8d41e258336?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/prettymuchbryce/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7269-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7269-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://prettymuchbryce.com/ld23/"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://prettymuchbryce.com/ld23/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1178,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Startrash Galaxy","category":"compo","description":"I only had 8.5 hours of time. :(\n-Not finished, but should be fully playable.\n-Source code is in GLBasic.

But, a lot of the code is setup for my primary idea... which I think is mostly unique.\n\nThe idea that I wanted to do is that as you kill enemies you level up and gain more bits. You store programs in your memory bank. Some take up a single bit and others more. You have four to start with. I was hopefully going to make these programs item drops from the mobs. In fact the mobs are setup very similarly and have a random set of programs that fit into their memory (which has the same size as yours if you're at the same level). \n\nI didn't get to do everything I wanted. Here's the short list:\n1) enemies need to attack back\n2) inventory to hold dropped algorithms\n3) the ability to reflash your memory...\n\nThe code is fairly close to having everything work together, and I'll probably finish it in the near future.\n\nHere is the list of the current programs (many of which are implemented, but you can't change which ones you use).\n\nAesthetic Programs:\nChangeShape\nChangeColor (Note: the random colors of mobs! They look particularly good for no good reason.)\n\nStat Programs:\nSpeedBoost\nSightBoost\nArmorBoost\nAttackBoost\nHealthBoost\nAttackRangeBoost\n\nSpecialized Programs\nDetectSight\nElementalAttack\nRangedAttack (Note: I imagine that as this grew that I'd have to live with the fact that all attacks are ranged and remove this is a special.)\nPoisonAttack\nSplashAttack\n\nIf I end up doing more work I'll add an extra link in the description as to not mix it up with the entry itself.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/12da8d7401f22d6b212659be9b8887bb.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=9888","author":{"name":"NefariousZhen","uid":9888,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a70f0bc23792d3a5152dd39657c86a0d?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/nefariouszhen/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/9888-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/9888-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/9888-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/9888-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/9888-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/9888-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://nbauernfeind.github.com/index.html"},{"label":"Download","url":"http://nbauernfeind.github.com/nibbles.zip"},{"label":"Source / Github","url":"http://github.com/nbauernfeind/Nibbles"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":63},{"area":"graphics","rank":423,"score":2.9},{"area":"audio","rank":584,"score":2.08},{"area":"mood","rank":590,"score":2.44},{"area":"fun","rank":702,"score":2.31},{"area":"humor","rank":748,"score":1.5},{"area":"overall","rank":749,"score":2.45},{"area":"innovation","rank":796,"score":2.06},{"area":"theme","rank":808,"score":2.14}],"platforms":["web","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Pollinate","category":"jam","description":"A puzzle game where you must collect flowers by going through a variety of puzzles and then breed them to collect every kind.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/03254b942374144da94709d7e372a518.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=11828","author":{"name":"garageworldgames","uid":11828,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cf912ec75f0815e5a2e10451aa20d4d8?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/garageworldgames/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11828-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11828-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11828-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11828-shot1.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11828-shot2.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11828-shot2.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.kongregate.com/games/GarageWorldGames/pollination"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1178,"score":0}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Seclude","category":"compo","description":"Made using Twine.

If you really are completely lost, head for a Fortress to get your first item.\n\nTheme Integration:\n------------------\nThe whole 'Tiny World' theme is part of the fact that the cubic world is tiny, and that its basically on top of a Rubik's cube. This is just what came to mind when I thought of 'Tiny World'.\n\nGeneral Notes:\n--------------\nInstructions are in-game.\nNo sound. I didn't have enough time to generate and implement it as I actually just finished. :(\n\nDevelopment Notes:\n------------------\n-I didn't use any libraries really, I just used whatever is offered by HaXe (which is open-source).\n-I did use some base code, though they were extremely simple . I actually ended up discarding most of them and rewriting them during the compo anyway.\n-I used someone else's free-to-use font. There are no specifications with personal vs. commercial use, but here is the pool of fonts I got it from, and it's creator's profile: http://www.dafont.com/max.d967\n\nGameplay Notes:\n---------------\n-When the map moves, it always moves upward so you know what's next.\n-More potions = not failing.\n-Its not a very long game, and figuring out where the items are comes from exploring, really. The village shop will give you some hints after you buy <something> *hint hint*.\n-It has been confirmed that the game is DIFFICULT, but not impossible! ;) Play the [Updated] version for a (hopefully) easier time.\n-Be wary that if any bugs exist (I think I managed to pick up most, if not all of them :D), they will exist in both the [Updated] and [Original] version.\n-I would really appreciate if you played the [Original] Web link first, primarily because that is what I believe I should be judged on. Not much difference exists except what's listed in Post-Compo Notes.\n\nPost-Compo Notes:\n------------\n-Found out the Windows version is sort of due to some things I hadn't considered with compile targets. Opt to play the Web link rather than download the Windows version, at least for now.\n-I took the comments below into consideration and made the game somewhat easier (I hope) in the [Updated] version.\n-I made the text on the signs for OK and Yes/No lighter and easier to see.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/581e9603bf28496bcc3cd146a1538700.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=3641","author":{"name":"angryshroom","uid":3641,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ea4c6be064d4dc48ee41e012f59f1c5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/angryshroom/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3641-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3641-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3641-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3641-shot1.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3641-shot2.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3641-shot2.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Web [Original]","url":"http://cl-17.com/pages/gamepages/ld23.html"},{"label":"Web [Updated]","url":"http://cl-17.com/pages/gamepages/ld23updated.html"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://cl-17.com/filedump/LD23.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://cl-17.com/filedump/LD23-Source.zip"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://youtu.be/hzZ_9zm45Hs"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":78},{"area":"innovation","rank":23,"score":4.15},{"area":"theme","rank":24,"score":4.1},{"area":"overall","rank":134,"score":3.52},{"area":"graphics","rank":144,"score":3.66},{"area":"fun","rank":199,"score":3.23},{"area":"mood","rank":221,"score":3.07},{"area":"humor","rank":504,"score":2.1},{"area":"audio","rank":751,"score":1.23}],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Stranded","category":"jam","description":"After being recently awarded your spaceship pilot's license you set off to explore the galaxy only to come crashing down on an unknown alien planet.

We may be doing a post-jam version at some point with more maps (and a volcano zone), as well as some fixes / improvements to the mechanics.\n\nThere is a timelapse video coming within the next few days.\n\nWe hope you enjoy our game!\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/1b57fcf6f684daf493aa4b13e2ed2d60.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=8607","author":{"name":"Evil Cult","uid":8607,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a4f9945a408fd72b8f23dfde57e3def0?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/vaelzan/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8607-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8607-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8607-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8607-shot1.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Java Webstart","url":"http://www.evilcult.net/tinyworld/stranded.jnlp"},{"label":"Gameplay Video","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kFMSBYY_a8"},{"label":"Post-Mortem","url":"http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/05/12/stranded-post-mortem-2/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"fun","rank":2,"score":4.04},{"area":"overall","rank":6,"score":4.07},{"area":"mood","rank":20,"score":3.65},{"area":"graphics","rank":23,"score":4.24},{"area":"audio","rank":39,"score":3.65},{"area":"humor","rank":61,"score":2.95},{"area":"theme","rank":79,"score":3.27},{"area":"innovation","rank":152,"score":2.78}],"platforms":["java"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"The Tiny World of Buzz","category":"compo","description":"NOTE: HTML5 game, so the audio is a bit poor and sometimes wont play :-( \n\nYou play as a worker bee, Buzz, fly about and collect your pollen quota, but don't get caught!

This would be friendly to \"deciding what to do next\" and would allow for a pretty decent mobile experience.\n\nI ended up with base systems for all of that, and then only had time to implement one enemy and a couple types of loot before I ran out of time.

Has an extra, unused music track (WHICH IS WAY GOOD) and a couple scribbles from my notebook that I made while working on it (THERE IS A DRAWING OF A WALKING BURGER).","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/2486ae7aac1d8bef7fb4d326ad6544ae.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=1159","author":{"name":"bburbank","uid":1159,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bf6f7c16081554319928cc9625e234a5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/skelethulu/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1159-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1159-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1159-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1159-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1159-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1159-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1159-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1159-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1159-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1159-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://youhavetohelp.us/ben/LD/LD23/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://youhavetohelp.us/ben/LD/LD23/source.zip"},{"label":"Ending Music","url":"http://soundcloud.com/you-have-to-help-us/action-science-dog-ending"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":63},{"area":"humor","rank":26,"score":3.71},{"area":"audio","rank":62,"score":3.56},{"area":"overall","rank":80,"score":3.68},{"area":"graphics","rank":101,"score":3.83},{"area":"mood","rank":117,"score":3.31},{"area":"fun","rank":123,"score":3.42},{"area":"innovation","rank":183,"score":3.47},{"area":"theme","rank":309,"score":3.26}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Bombs World","category":"compo","description":"This is inspired of a Rogue Like !

Trying to work to the 48 hour time limit with unfamiliar tools meant I really had to cut some corners but I'm fairly happy with the result given the circumstance.\n\nWith 'Tiny World' as the theme I took my inspiration from Super Mario Galaxy because it seemed an interesting challenge to recreate the very small planets of those games with their 'gravity could act in any direction' physics  ... the first day and a half was spent just trying to get the player model to point 'up', and fall 'down' without vearing off course while turning or walking over such unpredictable and often upside-down terrain; hence the title \"Quaternion Nightmare\". All other aspects of the game were developed on Sunday afternoon.\n\nIf I had had more time I would have added: engaging combat, simple 'key + lock box' style puzzles a boss fight and more than one world as well as music and a menu system.\n\nThe tools I used in development were:\nUnity (http://unity3d.com/)\nBlender (http://www.blender.org/)\nBFXR (http://www.bfxr.net/)\nPaint.NET (http://www.getpaint.net/)\nSpacescape (http://alexcpeterson.com/spacescape)\n\nFor anyone interested in the physics behind this type of game the following article explains it very nicely: http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131997/games_demystified_super_mario_.php\n\nGood luck everyone with your own entries!\n\nEnjoy :)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c9a3eea0b78f47399519dd7a923f9628.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=5357","author":{"name":"cakemonitor","uid":5357,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6106d779a98ffd2a1753ba23b2f248c9?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/cakemonitor/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/5357-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/5357-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://db.tt/j3TAD5aB"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://db.tt/Os7cmNWr"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":56},{"area":"theme","rank":142,"score":3.59},{"area":"innovation","rank":437,"score":2.91},{"area":"humor","rank":446,"score":2.19},{"area":"audio","rank":492,"score":2.32},{"area":"fun","rank":518,"score":2.66},{"area":"overall","rank":562,"score":2.76},{"area":"graphics","rank":625,"score":2.5},{"area":"mood","rank":701,"score":2.23}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Save The Tiny Planet!","category":"compo","description":"My first game made in java in under 20 hours.\nPlease vote if you enjoyed it!\n\n*If your stuck on where to start try clicking the trees*","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a56974f77378948fbc76a4c37507241e.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=12844","author":{"name":"Sam","uid":12844,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/73dd8286752c1a0cf3ea895bedec45b9?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/tau7153/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12844-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12844-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12844-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12844-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Zipped Jar File","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?qp870caa8argpyu"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?nd4mxg84la6bmsr"}],"ratings":[{"area":"humor","rank":68,"score":3.36},{"area":"theme","rank":164,"score":3.54},{"area":"graphics","rank":542,"score":2.69},{"area":"mood","rank":543,"score":2.5},{"area":"innovation","rank":623,"score":2.54},{"area":"fun","rank":668,"score":2.38},{"area":"overall","rank":741,"score":2.46},{"area":"coolness","rank":1074,"score":14}],"platforms":["java","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Shoebox World","category":"compo","description":"Grow your own ecosystem within the confines of a small shoebox!

Basically, I just wanted to make a game for Ludum Dare, having never done so. Graphics, music and sound are all made by myself in a period of 48 hours. There isn't a whole lot of variety and I didn't really have time to make any battle animations or enemies that did things other than attack, but hopefully the game is a little funny to at least one person and a good waste of 15 minutes or so. \n\nTHE ENDING!!!\n\nYeah, I know. I didn't have time to do more and the story actually starts getting good here. I might pick the game up again and release WINZIG DX SUPER AWESOME EDITION or something with a complete story, more variety, etc. I left out the fact that you get Eliza in your party and you actually get to a town and meet people instead of just traversing the inside of Jack's cubicle. There's always tomorrow, eh?\n\nCREDITS\n\nThanks to Dragon Quest for inspiration and RMVXACE for the engine because without it lol what is programming? Next time I hope to make something that's all from scratch though, engine and all.\n\nEXTRA TIPS!\n\nYou can full screen by pressing alt + enter\nYou can run by holding shift\nIf you \"Guard\" you will regain HP for free\nYou can save anywhere, but the save points are there to regain HP/MP + inspire you to save\n\nJUDGES!\n\nMade using an engine (RMVX) but everything else is mine. If that bends the rules somehow, please make this a jam entry!\n\n(Source is included in the main file)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b4d7ed2c8a99ec460336390626474ca9.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=12673","author":{"name":"Hydlide","uid":12673,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/de6c037a4ea8fc21dd191070c9884bd1?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/hydlide/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12673-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12673-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12673-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12673-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.theparadiselast.com/uploads/Winzig.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1178,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"\"The best\" CCG","category":"compo","description":"UPDATE 2\n\nI've now put up a web version. There are no new features (actually some features like custom names and saving were removed to make it work) but the code was changed quite a bit to make it work online so this should probably be considered a post-competition version.\n\nHopefully everyperson can at least try it now.\n\n\nA collectible card game named \"the best\".\n\n\nRequires Python 2.x (may also work in Python 3), downloadable from www.python.org\n\nDownload the ZIP, unzip the contents somewhere and run \"python menu.py\" or alternatively (on Windows) double click on run.bat\n\nYou can manually delete the file savegame to delete your save file.\n\nThe entire game plays on the command line. There was no time for the planned GUI. So the .zip file is actually 3 times smaller than the screenshot :)\n\nUPDATE 1\n\nI'm looking into putting up a web based server side version this weekend. For the moment, here is an alternative mirror if Fileden goes down:\n\nhttp://www.filedropper.com/best\n\n(except this one is not a direct link).\n\nAnd finally here's another attempt to explain what a card does.\n\nBy example (from the screenshot):\nThe card\n\n3-4 1:opp discard\n\nswaps positions 3 and 4. If the current order is BFDEAC (as in the screenshot), it becomes BFDAEC (A and E are swap). After the swap, if position 1 matches the goal (it does not since F isn't B), your opponent discards a card (if it doesn't match as in this case, there is no second effect).\n\nGenerally:\nThe card\n\na-b x1:effect1 x2:effect2 x3:effect3 ...\n\nswaps positions a and b. After the swap, if position x1 matches the goal, it triggers effect1. After the swap, if position x2 matches the goal, it triggers effect2. And so on.\n\nEND OF UPDATE 1","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b204af730b78d840596c3e3bd4b6bd27.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=12835","author":{"name":"cantorfew","uid":12835,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bf21d76f9e5133a40d78c049c5b020bf?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/cantorfew/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12835-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12835-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"All","url":"http://www.fileden.com/files/2012/4/22/3295546/best.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.fileden.com/files/2012/4/22/3295546/best.zip"},{"label":"Web (post-comp)","url":"http://ccgthebest.appspot.com/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":60},{"area":"innovation","rank":523,"score":2.73},{"area":"audio","rank":759,"score":1.17},{"area":"humor","rank":767,"score":1.46},{"area":"mood","rank":858,"score":1.47},{"area":"overall","rank":880,"score":1.85},{"area":"fun","rank":893,"score":1.38},{"area":"graphics","rank":902,"score":1.25},{"area":"theme","rank":904,"score":1.15}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Ant Slayer","category":"compo","description":"The bone-headed obvious choice, a small world ant shooting fps!\n\nIt's short, as I ran out of time for making levels (same as last time), but it does have a better ending at least.\n\nI have music this time!

I'm french, so I had to check the dictionary every 10 seconds...\n\nBlog : http://blog.deepnight.net\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/#!/deepnightfr","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/2069bc25fef1298d49b2ea010653e352.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=2982","author":{"name":"deepnight","uid":2982,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e379073d70dab2195716d99c9bae0f6a?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/deepnight/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/2982-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/2982-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/2982-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/2982-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/2982-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/2982-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/2982-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/2982-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/2982-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/2982-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Play (web)","url":"http://deepnight.net/games/ld23-memento/"},{"label":"Source (at last!)","url":"http://deepnight.net/games/ld23-memento/source.zip"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://youtu.be/kxO_TTcAxME"},{"label":"Webcam","url":"http://fr.twitch.tv/deepnight33/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":1,"score":4.68},{"area":"mood","rank":1,"score":4.49},{"area":"overall","rank":2,"score":4.39},{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":58},{"area":"theme","rank":10,"score":4.34},{"area":"fun","rank":41,"score":3.72},{"area":"innovation","rank":136,"score":3.58},{"area":"audio","rank":206,"score":3.04},{"area":"humor","rank":365,"score":2.34}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Mr.No's Laboratory","category":"compo","description":"[Description]\nYou are a 'volunteer' in a laboraty.\nYou want to get out?\nHack yourself your way through consoles and doors to the freedom!\n\n[Keys]\n<ARROW KEYS> - move\n<SPACE>      - activate\n<ESCAPE>     - escape (from the game for the moment)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/345164e3bb29e1848da7fb80c80389e9.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=12090","author":{"name":"Helco","uid":12090,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8624d0c9e08fc03ba61088630733e3a3?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/helco/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12090-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12090-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows Original","url":"http://www.file-upload.net/download-4294744/Mr.No-s-Laboratory.zip.html"},{"label":"Post Mortem 1.2 (with Source)","url":"http://www.file-upload.net/download-4310348/Mr.No-s-Laboratory1.2.zip.html"},{"label":"Source Original","url":"http://www.file-upload.net/download-4294760/Mr.No-s-Laboratory_Source.zip.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"humor","rank":201,"score":2.77},{"area":"mood","rank":424,"score":2.69},{"area":"innovation","rank":425,"score":2.94},{"area":"fun","rank":432,"score":2.81},{"area":"audio","rank":511,"score":2.27},{"area":"overall","rank":524,"score":2.81},{"area":"graphics","rank":602,"score":2.56},{"area":"theme","rank":656,"score":2.56},{"area":"coolness","rank":980,"score":22}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Path O' Invasion","category":"compo","description":"Only one virus can reign supreme!\n\nYou are the leader of a troop of pathogens.

In keeping with the theme (Tiny World) I thought up an idea where you're inside this wire and you have to \"repair\" the little dead areas on the wires inside the larger wire… if you've ever taken a look inside one of those you'll understand. Not realistic or anything and it's not supposed to be! :D\n\nI am SO glad I finished this. I learned so much making this game, even if it is a pretty simple game, and does have a few bugs. (Such as the random generation of the \"dead\" areas being a bit dodgy from time to time.)\n\nI rushed it out to meet the deadline. There were a few things I wanted to add, such as lightning bolts that would kill you, working out the more minor bugs (of course) and adding a boost feature. And more GUI, a better menu, and a little intro animation explaining the point.\nBut oh well, it's still a \"complete\" game anyways. Perfectly playable and surprisingly… kind of fun IMO. I didn't expect to impress anyone with this, just learn more myself and be more motivated this time around after giving up during LD22.\n\nAnyway, enjoy.

The plan is to implement some kind of towers on each base, that would be the ones that power the bases. In order to conquer your enemy's base, you should take down those towers, and stand on that base.\n\nIt also lacks a hud showing the HP and the energy in order to shoot. I wanted to add a XP and improvement system too.\n\nHowever, for the little time I had this weekend, I'm quite satisfied with the result.\n\n\nAll the content is mine except for some sound effects. The background music is also mine, made with GarageBand.\n\nI hope you like it!\n\n\nMade with Flash, AS3.\n\n\n\n//Notes edit\n\nOkay, I feel like I should explain something more.\n\nHow does it shoot? You can only shoot if there's an enemy ship close to you, so if you can't make it shoot, just try to get closer to the enemy's ship.\n\nEven though there's not a HUD, ships have HP and a reload time. So you don't need to spam the spacebar, because it's not going to shoot faster. You can even hold it down, and it will shoot when possible.\n\n\nYou can also just look and enjoy the AI.\n\n\nThe game gets slow after some time, and other bugs and lacks, but I prefer not to modify my entry until the judgement periode has ended. I hope you like the game! Thanks for the comments!\n\n\n\n//Okay, EXTRA DESCRIPTION\n\nWhat is this game? Even though I aimed for more (but I hadn't the time to achieve it), the result is an endless battle between two factions. It WON'T end.\n\nYou can just try to survive while killing enemy ships. With a little of practice, you will figure out (more or less) how projectiles move and, therefore, it will be more easy to avoid them. (Just a bit)\n\nSo you might have some great moments, like luckily avoiding 5 bullets that were on your tail, and you'll feel like a badass X-Wing pilot.\n\n\n//Goodie!\n\nThe background track is uploaded right here: http://soundcloud.com/airrider3/premiere\n\nIt is not finished, but I had to use something, so...\n\n\n//Additional information!\n\n- The screen size (SWF stage size) is 960x640, the same as the iPhone Retina screen in landscape mode, as I was hoping to release it for iOS and Android too. But time didn't help.\n\n- For getting the key events, I always use a class I made a year ago. If anyone's curious, it's also included on the source, though there are different versions of it, and there's not a read me, instructions, or anything because it hasn't been released yet. Maybe this summer.\n\n- The map was initially a floating island. A tiny world. An idea was being able to conquer bases along different planets on a system. Maybe even on different systems.\n\n- You can follow me on Twitter at @AirRider3","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/97ca91d5a2b07d6876d9f72782e03165.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=7398","author":{"name":"AirRider3","uid":7398,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e364f30b433c2db3b980358deae096c7?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/airrider3/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7398-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7398-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://bluecodestudio.com/ludumdare23/airrider23.swf"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?2geoiu3c3c686ti"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":73},{"area":"audio","rank":250,"score":2.93},{"area":"innovation","rank":397,"score":3},{"area":"mood","rank":437,"score":2.67},{"area":"fun","rank":455,"score":2.76},{"area":"overall","rank":508,"score":2.84},{"area":"graphics","rank":563,"score":2.64},{"area":"humor","rank":684,"score":1.72},{"area":"theme","rank":766,"score":2.28}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"The borders of Tiny World","category":"jam","description":"You are \" Blob #23105 \" .

Instructions are on the title screen.\n\nThis is my first submission to the Ludum Dare and there are bunches of things I would wish to do better in this game.  There are a few bugs with geometry, the draw order is inconsistent, and I only got to implement about half of what I wanted.\n\nBut still, it works!  Great success!   :-)\n\nTechnical notes:\n * Tested on Python 2.7 and Pygame 1.9, on Linux and Windows XP and 7\n * It does all the drawing and junk in software, so it actually needs a fairly powerful CPU to run at full speed.  I didn't really try to optimize it.

I wonder if anyone is interested in seeing it developed further in the future. We'd really like to complete it.\n\nThis was our first jam, and the first time we've attempted to make a full game together. The main focus of the project was to learn how to make games in HTML5 and to get experience in pixel asset creation. Though the game wasn't finished, we learned a heck of a lot and had loads of fun.\n\nThe idea was to present a world in which the only currency is \"progress\" (the stuff that fills bars). To the inhabitants of this world, achieving progress is all that matters in life.\n\nIt was intended to be a satire on the current state of 'achievement'-based game design - especially within MMOs - where some players can be compelled to feel that their game world is more important than the real one, when in fact, it is 'tiny' in comparison.\n\nIn its current state, it's a simple demonstration of basic platform mechanics and tile rendering in HTML5. In the future, there will be an ultra-compelling level-up mechanic, NPCs to talk to, and hopefully an ending of sorts.\n\nOne of the biggest lessons learned during the Jam was that no matter how small you think your idea is - it's still pretty big.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/907f8c2606736aced50b7d1334736857.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=11522","author":{"name":"SevenForce","uid":11522,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f2b7d66164e4f761d129072a70175842?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/sevenforce/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11522-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11522-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11522-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11522-shot1.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://daveskilton.com/GameBlog/LudumDare/ld23/public/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":71,"score":3.79},{"area":"fun","rank":261,"score":1.33},{"area":"theme","rank":261,"score":1.42},{"area":"innovation","rank":262,"score":1.27},{"area":"overall","rank":263,"score":1.5},{"area":"coolness","rank":1178,"score":0}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Superpixel","category":"compo","description":"Warning: Hard mode is HARD.

Walk counter-clockwise under the hill and hit the switch. Jump back counter-clockwise to where you started. Keep going counter-clockwise until your are past the rabbit and on top of a platform with a ramp going down counter-clockwise. Jump clockwise onto the raised platform, keep running and do another jump. Wait for the spike ball, then jump again. Finally, jump up and clockwise to hit a switch on the top of World 3. This feeds the rabbit. Now drop down and go counter-clockwise down that ramp. Platform up this section, avoiding the spike ball. When you get to the top, head clockwise first, and walk clockwise (don't jump). You'll drop onto a platform with a switch. Now that you have 3 karma kill yourself. Hold space and press left on the keyboard to push the block down. Keep walking counter-clockwise up the hill to the goal.\n\nWorld 3 part 2 -\nWalk counter-clockwise until you're at a tree.

Highlights of LD23 included TWO power blackouts (the first was for 7-8 hours).\n\nGame Summary:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou play as an unknown character, whos been rejected by the people he belongs to. You've spent too long, lying on the floor in a dark and abandoned old dungeon, completely forgotten. \nSuddenly you take it upon yourself to escape, and so that is your main mission - starting by escaping the cell youve been in for an immeasurable amount of time, into an unknown and potentially dangerous environment. \nLots of critters scurry about the floor, and with thanks to a special ability (the very ability which got you into so much trouble in the first place) you find you can inhabit the bodies of the smaller creatures scurrying nearby.\n\nMaybe this will be your first step towards being free again?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nMade with Blender(BGE), Gimp, Audacity and coded in Python.\n\n\n>>Read the Readme.txt!<<\nControls are in there, I didnt have time to add all of the instructions in-game, but most major controls made it into actual in-game popups.\n\n\n**** Missing VCOMP100.dll error????\nSome people have reported that the game wont run due to a 'missing VCOMP100.dll' error. This is to do with not having installed the Visual C++ 2012 Redistributable on your system\nIts a pain that this is happening, but quick google search will come up with several different places to download (go for the one hosted on the Microsoft website). Once thats installed everything should go smoothly. (for those of you who are really keen to play this game, but who are being stopped by this error)\n****\n\n\n\n-Audio issues fixed in v0.9-\n\nIll be trying to get both a mac and linux version up asap as well, so no one will be forgotten hopefully :)\nAlso, note, you may need a pretty modern rig to run this game. Theres a link below to a less resource intensive build of the game, either way though -let me know if your fps are acceptable - or not. That was my main concern during the development of the game....\n\nFull 48 hour timelapse of the creation of the game below!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-s_raRVcF0\n\n\nSo feel free to download (30mb) and give it a shot! Id appreciate feedback and comments.\n\nWindows(32bit)- http://www.mediafire.com/?7684syfaa19day2 (as in the header)\n\n*source is also available (~85mb) (see header)\n\n\nOriginal build (v0.6) is here, this is what I first submitted, and is 64bit windows only, with show stopper bugs - so most people wont be able to play it - http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?ly15m87itpqkoj0\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the game running slow for you?? \nHeres a build which should run faster for those with slower computers/laptops, Ive cut out the dynamic shadows so youll lack some eye candy there. And the frame size is reduced to 800x600. \nLink -  Win(32bit) http://www.mediafire.com/?c4e3u8oribpz0ba","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/3c47503320936c774a208b86f9b8b472.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=3467","author":{"name":"AD-Edge","uid":3467,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/32e23d6d3389bf0d1cc5b40842523a73?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/ad-edge/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3467-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3467-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3467-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3467-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3467-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3467-shot2.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3467-shot3.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3467-shot3.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3467-shot4.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3467-shot4.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?7684syfaa19day2"},{"label":"Windows [Optimised build]","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?c4e3u8oribpz0ba"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-s_raRVcF0"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?5lrecd0mcztyoar"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":76},{"area":"mood","rank":5,"score":4.26},{"area":"graphics","rank":117,"score":3.77},{"area":"overall","rank":125,"score":3.55},{"area":"audio","rank":142,"score":3.21},{"area":"innovation","rank":177,"score":3.48},{"area":"fun","rank":370,"score":2.93},{"area":"theme","rank":543,"score":2.8},{"area":"humor","rank":678,"score":1.73}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Accretion","category":"compo","description":"You are a caveman.

This is the first game that has seen the light of day from my frame work. The other game I'm working on has been taking sooo long it felt really good to get in and write a little dirty code over the weekend.\n\nAll in all I spent < 20 hours on the whole thing. I would have submitted to the Compo but I work at a bar to help make ends meet right now and this weekend I happened to be scheduled for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Friday was the only night I wasn't on till close (2am). I also had not used some of the code in my framework before so I had no idea how much patching it might take to get it up and running, of those 20 hours about 5 was spent on rewriting classes. So, for me, this was quite an accomplishment.\n\nI am very seriously thinking about making this into a full game, I like the boulder dropping mechanic and have a ton of ideas on how to make this interesting for 20+ levels.\n\nAs always feedback is appreciated, good or bad. It actually just puts a spring in my step knowing people are playing something I created. \n\nCheers and happy gaming!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c37bc634512dfa9bc112659bf2b96927.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=4415","author":{"name":"jclaine","uid":4415,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/31d097236688ebcbbe5ae712d02a94d5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/jclaine/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4415-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4415-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4415-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4415-shot1.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.mustnotsleepgames.com/Games/LD48/Boulder_Drop_v0.02.swf"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.mustnotsleepgames.com/Games/LD48/BD.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"humor","rank":155,"score":2.09},{"area":"innovation","rank":180,"score":2.54},{"area":"fun","rank":197,"score":2.29},{"area":"theme","rank":207,"score":2.38},{"area":"graphics","rank":216,"score":2.38},{"area":"mood","rank":222,"score":1.89},{"area":"overall","rank":226,"score":2.31},{"area":"coolness","rank":1007,"score":20}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Crysthurl","category":"compo","description":"A very simple platformer where the protagonist has to throw blocks/crates to smash a white hexagon, which is meant to represent a crystal.\n\nYou must build towers, avoid spikes, commit suicide and... jump, to progress.\n\nAfter a couple of failed attempts, this is my first finished game for Ludum Dare.

If anyone has a problem with that, I can revert to the previous version, but the game in itself is exactly the same.\n\nEdit 2012.04.29: Fixed preloading of images (somehow) and game launch (with the Right key rather than click on button), I consider these as bugfixes.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/35e852fa47c26f953c703481d17c70db.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=8666","author":{"name":"Niavlys","uid":8666,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/85cb282e36745243b871de034ba06eff?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/niavlys/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8666-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8666-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/110083615/LD23-Sprace/index.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":52},{"area":"humor","rank":148,"score":2.96},{"area":"theme","rank":259,"score":3.34},{"area":"audio","rank":655,"score":1.83},{"area":"graphics","rank":666,"score":2.43},{"area":"mood","rank":672,"score":2.29},{"area":"innovation","rank":690,"score":2.37},{"area":"fun","rank":723,"score":2.26},{"area":"overall","rank":754,"score":2.44}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Stupid Ants","category":"compo","description":"Ants are stupid, they just walk around randomly.

I've been thinking on this game for a few weeks, so it was just about time.\n\nThe game is HEAVILY inspired by Phage Wars and Eufloria.

Green grasses yield attacking units, blue waters yield magic units, and red clay yields defensive units.\nDeploying troops: \nYou can deploy troops as offensive, defensive, and sometimes (depending on your race) as magical. You may deploy as many troops to as many territories as you'd like until you either loose an offensive campaign or click on the TakeTurn/EndTurn button at the bottom of the screen.\n    Offensive deployments can only be made to uncontested or enemy controlled territories.

When you lose a battle, you lose your deployed units along with the ability deploy any more troops on this turn.\n    Magical deployments are only possible with the goblin and human races. Other races' magic abilities are used automatically.\n    Defensive deployments can only be made to territories that you already control.

Dig twice in the same place to make a big enough hole for water to flow in it - connect the holes/ditches with water and water will flow in the ditches!\n\nControls:\nWalk around with WASD.\nInteract with objects and NPCs using \"1\".\nDig wholes in the ground using \"2\".\nWhen you have completed the first quest you can use the axe with \"3\".\n\nFirst press the action you want to use, then press one of the available tiles to use it at that tile.

So I'll put a good run in for LD24!\n3: Motivation and ideas were lacking around the midway point\n\nI had fun, of course!

Get it here www.java.com\n\nInstructions:\nWASD to move\nHover over planets to popup info window.\nExpand the drop downs to interact.\n\nShip info:\n- To Fix: metal = level x 20, oil = level x 10, slaves = level x 5\n- To Upgrade: metal = level x 50, oil = level x 20, slaves = level x 10\n\nHome Planet info:\n- To Upgrade: wood = level x 100, stone = level x 70, slaves = level x 50\n\nDescription:\nYou're a dejected robot on your tiny home planet, all alone with no resources. One day a random spaceship crashes into your planet, which you proceed to claim as your own!\nYou start adventuring around your \"cluster\" of planets (50 of them), quietly stealing resources necessary to upgrade your spaceship and your home planet.\nYour goal is to conquer the universe, by destroying all 50 planets, making you the most powerful robot ever....all alone.....Forever Alone......\n\nHow To Play:\n- To take an action on a planet, you hover your ship over it where a window will popup on the lower right hand corner of the screen. Expand the tab to take actions!\n- You can only manage to quietly steal from a planet once, all further attempts will cause them to notice you and hurt you by 10 HP. You do still manage to steal, but not as much as the first time.\n- Attacking a planet will make you take all their resources (to the max your spaceship can hold), and even the population become slaves. However, your HP will go down by the planet's Defense value.\n- Your home planet is where you store your resources. Storing puts all your resources on the planet. Equipping equips your ship up to the max it can hold.\n- There is no point to upgrade your home planet, that was for a proposed idea where planets attack your home to try and stop your unending rampage!\n- Your ship's max HP and max resource capacity can be increased by upgrading your ship.\n\nThe background music is Clair de Lune by Debussy. I would have performed it (I'm a professional pianist), but I had no time and ended up using an online source. I don't believe you can copyright such music, so it's considered public domain.\n\nIt has quite a bit of data to load, so give it a minute...I should have put a loading screen :P\n\nCoded by me from scratch using my lovely game library: java-game-utils.googlecode.com\n\nArt is by razorquick. He's pretty awesome. :P","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/61c7a53fa9c2c0edb85e5f25d1486132.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=4393","author":{"name":"ra4king","uid":4393,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/44e0aed6a8dc8fb616c7fa215a816f8e?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/ra4king/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4393-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4393-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4393-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4393-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"All OS's (JNLP)","url":"http://www.ra4king.com/wp-content/uploads/LudumDare/LD23-ForeverAlone/ForeverAlone.jnlp"}],"ratings":[{"area":"mood","rank":37,"score":3.5},{"area":"audio","rank":44,"score":3.55},{"area":"fun","rank":54,"score":3.3},{"area":"overall","rank":69,"score":3.39},{"area":"innovation","rank":107,"score":3.09},{"area":"theme","rank":116,"score":3.04},{"area":"graphics","rank":156,"score":2.96},{"area":"humor","rank":177,"score":1.92},{"area":"coolness","rank":688,"score":46}],"platforms":["java","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"GERMS!","category":"compo","description":"It is buggy but this is my first ludum dare so whatever.

The game can be \"uninstalled\" by going into All Programs and Features in Windows and uninstalling Engine.exe.\n\nAlso, for people with bad graphics cards, the postcompo version is compiled in Reach mode for that.  I'd do it for the compo one too but I don't have the commit for that anymore :(\n\nQuick Summary:\nCatch up to your enemy by building energy harvesters that speed you up after you cross them.  Research items to do nice things with them.  Whoever catches up to the other first shoots them and wins.\n\nThat's all you really need to know.  go go go go go go\n\nLinear RTS.  Shoot your enemy before he shoots you.  Speed yourself up by building harvesters.  Slow your enemy down by researching dead babies, detonators, and the elusive nuke.\n\nLeft Click is only control.  You cannot walk backwards.\n\nSome things to try:\n-Drop dead babies to slow down your enemy.\n-Better yet, throw dead babies in the air to take down enemy harvesters.\n-The detonator destroys harvesters within a small radius (including your own).  Useful to drop harvesters on the enemy this way, hint hint.\n-Nuke destroys all enemy harvesters etc.\n\nGood LD this time enjoy everyone etc.\n\nEDIT: Why didn't /anyone/ tell me the game wasn't working on their machines?\n\nI uploaded the working one post-deadline.  There's no changes except that it's actually packaged correctly so now it'll run on machines that don't already have XNA installed.  Hopefully that's alright? :<\n\nEDIT 2: Well, it works now.  But there's a pretty game-breaking bug where the enemy would freeze if he hit a generator.\n\nI've uploaded the fixed version but for the sake of honesty the old one is still up.

After all, why play a game with one tiny world when you could play a game with two galaxies-worth of tiny worlds? G to grab/release planets and F to use the jetpack. The jetpack gives fast movement speed but runs out quickly when carrying many planets.\n\nI got in about 25 hours on this one, but there are still a few bugs to fix. I had to cut it short for some work on homework, unfortunately, but I'm still happy with the outcome. However, if something inexplicable happens...try releasing and grabbing the planets again, and try not to let planets collide when you aren't holding any of them. There shouldn't be any problems most of the time...\n\nOther tips: The range of Chadley's grab is somewhat finicky, so you may have to line up his hands with a planet in order to grab it. Also, releasing a planet/planet group gives it a bit of angular momentum.\n\nCoded in Javascript/HTML5, with library code from the Video Game Development Club at the University of Minnesota.

I have now fixed this so hopefully the game will run for everyone!\nThanks for testing it!\n*************************************\n\n*Edit 2******************************\nI've added a Mac and Linux version. I haven't been able to test either, but hope they will work. \n\nTo run the game (these instructions are copied form love2d.org):\n\n-- MAC -----------------------------\nOn Mac OSX, a folder or .love file can be dropped onto the Love.app application bundle. On the Mac OSX Terminal (commandline), you can use love like this (assuming it's installed to the Applications directory):\n\nopen -n -a love \"/home/path/to/game\"\n\nIn some cases it may be faster to invoke the love binary inside the application bundle directly via the following:\n\n/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love mygame\n\nYou can setup an alias in your Terminal session to call the binary when you use love by adding an alias to your ~/.bash_profile (open -a TextEdit ~/.bash_profile):\n\n# alias to love\nalias love=\"/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love\"\nNow you can call love from the commandline like Linux and Windows:\n\nlove \"/home/path/to/game\"\n\nIf you debug using the print command, it is useful to see this printed in realtime. In which case the following will open an extra window that will show the printed text.\n\nxterm -e /Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love \"/home/path/to/game\"\n\n-- LINUX ------------------------\n\nOn Linux, you can use one of these command lines:\n\nlove /home/path/to/gamedir/\nlove /home/path/to/packagedgame.love\nIf you have installed the .deb, you can double click on .love files in your file manager as well.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nRun in fullscreen mode:\n\nTo change tofullscreen to window mode: change love-file's ending to zip.

Everyone can play! Open your browser, grab a key, and hang on tight! Careful, though: build up too much speed and you'll take off, losing traction and slowing you down.\n\n* Controls: ANY KEY. LITERALLY ALMOST ANY KEY ON YOUR KEYMABOARD.\n* Strategy: Hold your key to accelerate, but let off before you fly off the planet and lose speed.\n\n\nTHE DETAILS\n-----------\nI developed this game solo in 72 hours. The game is built on the HTML5 canvas and Javascript. Libraries at work behind the scenes include CraftyJS, Jukebox, Underscore.js, and jQuery. Sound effects were generated by the always-lovely sfxr (flash port at superflashbros.net). The game has been tested in Firefox 11 and Chrome 18 for OSX.\n\nI had plans for multiple unicycles, multiple planets, more advanced physics, and a lot more feedback to players. I've had the whole one-button UI flow worked out for a while and this was going to be the proof of concept. As is, I barely squeaked in under the Jam submission deadline (with SECONDS to spare!), so I wasn't able to realize anything more than the basic gameplay.\n\n\nKNOWN ISSUES\n------------\nThe sound isn't great in Chrome. I think Zynga lists this as a known issue with Jukebox on Chrome, something to do with Chrome's audio codecs. Use Firefox if you can.\n\nThe game swallows most keystrokes, so your browser shortcut keys probably won't work while the game is displayed. This is the price of admission.\n\nThe player color selection is overly simple and gets confused when multiple players join and leave. There are only 10 colors in this version, so they repeat if you have more than 10 players. Also, the player tint is supposed to apply to the sprite, not the background, but there's a long-standing bug in CraftyJS that I haven't gotten around to patching.\n\nYou'll find there are some key combinations on your keyboard that work better than others when you have several players. Anyone who played local multiplayer shareware games in the '90s remembers this problem. =) Experiment in the pregame to make sure everyone's key works when all the others are held down. Try hooking up a game controller or wiimote and binding the buttons to keys to cram even more players in!\n\n\nLEAVE A MESSAGE\n---------------\nEach and every smidge of feedback is fabulous; please do leave a note or hit me up on Twitter (@mildmojo) if you have any words for me. And thanks for giving it a try.

You are the god in control of a tiny world, but there are other, bigger, gods out there who do not look kindly on your rise to power.\n\nYou have no direct control over your units, only the mix and number of each that exist. It is up to you to make sure there is an adequate food supply, and a sufficient number of them to hold off invaders.\n\nI didn't have time to complete the additional levels I had planned, but I plan to complete more sometime this week and put it up separately. This first level is an introduction to your main units and how they interact and building story, the second level would be taking them to the world of another god and using them to invade.\n\nP.S. There are hints that show up as you play at the bottom of the screen, they are relevant to what is happening at the time.\n\nUPDATE: I added a WIP link with the latest version, with bug fixes and new features. Including a 4th unit that plants grass.\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: Why did I win?\nA: In the instructions (button on the title screen) it says that you need to hit 2500 Life force to beat the level. I'll try to make that clearer in an updated version.\n\nQ: How do the zombie waves work?\nA: The number of zombies is random, currently its (5 + random(1-6)) * wavenumber. I'll try to make it more incremental.\n\nQ: Why did some of the humans run from the zombies?\nA: The women (humans with bows) run from zombies but are required for men to reproduce. Men will run towards zombies and fight them.\n\nQ: What is the relationship between Life Force and Life Power? \nA: Creating Life builds your Life Force. The more complicated the life is the more Life Force it is worth. In order to hit 2500 Life Force and end the game you will need a lot of Men. In order to sustain a lot of Men you will need a lot of Cows to feed them. Life Power is granted to you every 4 seconds based on the amount of living beings that currently exist in your world. It caps at 200 and is the currency used to create life.\n\nQ: I plateaued at X life, how do I get more?\nA: Build more units! The more units you build the higher your life force! Just keep building till you hit 2500.\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/91ebcca306bc4144de82d92c5aca5fb0.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=11378","author":{"name":"Lacutis","uid":11378,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7cfb21e44ea467da0d4fb22c2f3251fe?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/lacutis/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11378-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11378-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11378-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11378-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11378-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11378-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11378-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11378-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://unimatrix01.org/games/TinyGodv1.exe"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://unimatrix01.org/games/TinyGodv1.swf"},{"label":"Web (WIP)","url":"http://unimatrix01.org/games/TinyGodWIP.swf"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://unimatrix01.org/source/TinyGodv1.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":82},{"area":"humor","rank":201,"score":2.77},{"area":"innovation","rank":253,"score":3.31},{"area":"fun","rank":265,"score":3.11},{"area":"theme","rank":384,"score":3.13},{"area":"overall","rank":410,"score":3},{"area":"audio","rank":427,"score":2.49},{"area":"mood","rank":453,"score":2.65},{"area":"graphics","rank":661,"score":2.44}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Tiny Tiny World","category":"compo","description":"Download the zip file and open tinyworld.html\nYou'll need a web browser capable of html5.

The movement is somewhat smoother than before.\nIf you press the Space key, an orbit will be drawn on screen. If you then place a satellite (while pressing the Space key), it will follow said orbit, instead of being stationary.\n\nThere's a new HUD (there's \"A\" HUD, in fact XD). It shows:\n  - Score\n  - Energy\n  - Highscore\n  - Active weapon  (bottom left of the screen)\n  - Active satellite (bottom right of the screen)\n\nTo change the type of satellite to use, just press the 'Q', 'W', 'E' and 'R' keys. The satellites are:\n- Type 1: shoots like a Boss\n- Type 2: tractor beam. Kinda weak, though - it only slows down the enemies\n- Type 3: repulse beam. Move them out of the way!\n- Type 4: energy sucker. Steal their energy to increase the turret's regeneration rate\nPlacing a satellite sucks half of the available energy (50 units). And they regenerate their energy too, now.\nYou can place up to 4 satellites on screen simultaneously. The only requirement is to have enough energy for its \"teleportation\"\n\nTwo new types of enemies, that you will encounter from the 8th wave onwards:\n- Mine: slow and erratic movement, but smallish (hard to hit) and with quite a bang!\n- Mecha: enters an orbit around the planet and chases the player's position. It has a front shield that repels energy shots. And that's as much as I can tell :D\n\nThe 'Ripple' gun (number 3) is weaker than before, but it has the ability to slightly push enemies back (depending on a variable 'weight' associated with each enemy type)\n\nThere are some new graphical bells and whistles, of course. Like a nifty tiny life bar that shows you how your enemies are feeling.\nOh! And there are some sounds! No music yet, though...\nThe game can be completed successfully. But it won't be easy. Trust me on that one XD\n\nPlease try this version out if you feel like the original Ludum Dare version had some potential. You'll see you were completely wrong! XD But, should you vote, please vote solely based on the original version!\n\nORIGINAL POST:\nPlease enjoy my first Ludum Dare game to date! :D\n\nSource code included with the .exe\n\nEnjoy, and thanks for your time!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/6100c00b13a48aa090233855c77198e3.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=11273","author":{"name":"TenTonToon","uid":11273,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/72f6e034458f27800a6cdf912bc6ada1?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/tentontoon/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11273-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11273-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11273-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11273-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11273-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11273-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11273-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11273-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows/Source","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?49s4ggt8aa33w69"},{"label":"The \"8 nights, 9 days after\" build","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?o3vb5hogtmg63rb"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":81},{"area":"graphics","rank":301,"score":3.15},{"area":"theme","rank":413,"score":3.07},{"area":"humor","rank":632,"score":1.84},{"area":"audio","rank":677,"score":1.74},{"area":"mood","rank":757,"score":2.09},{"area":"fun","rank":795,"score":2.02},{"area":"overall","rank":815,"score":2.27},{"area":"innovation","rank":830,"score":1.98}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Bipolar","category":"jam","description":"A man is trapped in his own little world.

Your milage may vary - let me know if it works for you!\n\n---\n\nDevelopment details:\n\nThis is my third Ludum Dare, and the first one I have finished. I wanted to use a C++ based game engine, as I am doing a technical job interview in the next few days where C++ is a assessed, and I haven't done any C++ in several years :)\n\nSo, that said, I used the Angel game prototyping engine (built for game jams like this). See (http://code.google.com/p/angel-engine/) I've never used it before, but it seems fairly well rounded. The docs are a little out of date though, so digging through source code was necessary. I built the game in 40hrs, finishing with 4hrs to spare.\n\nGIMP was used for graphics, Xcode for programming (Angel engine needs XCode to build on Mac). I used SFXR for sound effects and the music was taken straight from the Angel engine demos.\n\nI wanted to add more functionality: Rain that hurts ants, the ability to travel down the anthill and dig underground, random insect encounters and magnifying-glasses of death, more terrain types (rocks, grass etc) and also more AI functionality (ants will help other ants / communicate where food deposits are). All of these features got cut due to time :)\n\nI'm super stoked to have actually finished this to a point where it works and is fun - a bit of a personal milestone for me :)\n\nThings I learned:\n * I HATE XCODE! SOOOO MUCH HATE!!! There were many occasions where a physical bug in Xcode itself would prevent me from being able to build my game. I would have to delete entire methods and re-type them before Xcode would link them correctly.\n * Next time, I'll be using a JS-based html5 engine, so it's much easier for people to play and vote :)\n * If your game engine supports a scripting language, such as Lua, use it. It will save you a lot of time.\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/5ef71434035105f4ff88c7c121050536.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=5348","author":{"name":"aaronsnoswell","uid":5348,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ffbc0e7196b2f84159f59eeb2bd05fdc?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/aaronsnoswell/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/5348-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/5348-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/5348-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/5348-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/5348-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/5348-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/52276321/TinyColonyWin32.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/52276321/TinyColony.app.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/aaronsnoswell/ludumdare-23"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://youtu.be/jPYm36hWpwU"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":71},{"area":"fun","rank":78,"score":3.56},{"area":"theme","rank":86,"score":3.75},{"area":"overall","rank":166,"score":3.44},{"area":"audio","rank":172,"score":3.13},{"area":"mood","rank":221,"score":3.07},{"area":"humor","rank":312,"score":2.47},{"area":"innovation","rank":330,"score":3.16},{"area":"graphics","rank":415,"score":2.91}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Tinyman's Adventure","category":"compo","description":"The instructions are included once you run the game.\nI used:\nGimp 2.6\nGamemaker 8.1 Lite\nSfxr\nAudacity","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e18e1e09c4eb055420987010ee8e5690.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=10454","author":{"name":"killahnukah","uid":10454,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e692a28bcd537469f48070517ec26f60?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/killahnukah/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10454-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10454-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?8skwtiavqv8hcka"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?blcjuq4i7ir42xe"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1178,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"TinySpaceFoos","category":"compo","description":"It's a nice day to take your FooBar 9000 space ship out flying....wait, every day is a great day for flying your FooBar 9000. \n\nJust Fly baby!\n\nleft/right --yaw\nup/down --elevate\n\nleft-shift --cycle weapons\nspacebar --shoot weapons\n\nFly your FooBar 9000, enjoy!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/40c75fd378089debb159b696e15765ab.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=12916","author":{"name":"fdastero","uid":12916,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/03ad047b7cec4e334b8916efd917fdb6?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/fdastero/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12916-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12916-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/74952227/tinyspacefoos.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://code.google.com/p/tinyspacefoos/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":361,"score":3},{"area":"coolness","rank":1120,"score":10}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Wild Ontrys","category":"compo","description":"A tiny life simulation on a tiny world. \n\n\nChoose arbitrary who to kill in order to preserve the most possible, or choose not to act and see people die of starving for a lack of food.\n\nWill you play god?

It can be done, but the failure rate goes through the roof. If anyone wants a standalone .exe version to try, you can get it here: http://www.mediafire.com/?t29xvhkehvigngu\n\nThe likelihood of issues is high, however. This is due to XNA projects being dependent on other libraries that the installer puts in place if they are not already present. Essentially, if the XNA framework libraries are already present and correct, the game should work, if not, you will likely have issues if the game even runs at all.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/520c1f37d076db075ae99b1260aff2ac.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=8490","author":{"name":"kutuup1989","uid":8490,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e4f82fd72a56528e60cc4e2190a3fc2b?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/kutuup1989/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8490-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8490-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8490-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8490-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?c93c9kid894xsa9"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":50},{"area":"audio","rank":117,"score":3.29},{"area":"theme","rank":208,"score":3.46},{"area":"humor","rank":312,"score":2.47},{"area":"innovation","rank":319,"score":3.19},{"area":"graphics","rank":499,"score":2.77},{"area":"mood","rank":512,"score":2.57},{"area":"overall","rank":583,"score":2.73},{"area":"fun","rank":680,"score":2.35}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Bottle

I know its not that fun without them but I tried my best and if only I wasn't so sick. Have fun playing it, though. \n\nEDIT: Feeling much better today, I managed to add the little bit of code required to add working cops and pedestrians (even though they are extremely primitive and buggy). I didn't manage to add any music or sound though as I still am extremely sick and even went to the ER yesterday on account of a very high fever. I am feeling better today, my throat still hurts like a b**** though.  I didn't add any sound because that would be going out of my comfort zone unlike coding which is quite relaxing.

But, if you don't consider updating the game cheating, or simply want to play the new version, which i recommend you do as it is much better, you can. \n\nNOTE: The Web version is the new version, all the others are the original.\n\nAlso this game was made using Flixel and Flixel Powertools, which are both great and extremely useful.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/398fbcb04efc9e7edfb88e9b02667cb0.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=12107","author":{"name":"miharbi","uid":12107,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/05d27aa3fd933769a532ab9e37b117c5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/miharbi/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12107-shot0.gif-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12107-shot0.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows( please read description)","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?x7to9bgvags5i64"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?x7to9bgvags5i64"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?x7to9bgvags5i64"},{"label":"Web( please read description)","url":"http://www.swfcabin.com/open/1335372224"}],"ratings":[{"area":"humor","rank":86,"score":2.67},{"area":"theme","rank":151,"score":2.86},{"area":"audio","rank":209,"score":1.22},{"area":"mood","rank":219,"score":1.92},{"area":"graphics","rank":229,"score":2.2},{"area":"fun","rank":246,"score":1.75},{"area":"innovation","rank":250,"score":1.85},{"area":"overall","rank":251,"score":1.95},{"area":"coolness","rank":851,"score":33}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"A Flying Shame","category":"compo","description":"Summary:\nTake control of a humble fly.

Please report any problems below.\n\nInstructions:\n\n_There is a limited tutorial, so keep an eye on the status bar on the bottom of the page. The status bar will also warn you of any new issues or problems._\n\nYou manage your asteroid by constructing buildings and moving colonists between those buildings. Every game turn, each building consumes some resources, and then produces some. If it can't consume all necessary resources, the building does not produce anything. \n\nYou have 600 days to produce rare earth minerals, and ship them through a freight depot for points. After that you will be out of range of the support ships, and must abandon asteroid.\n\nThe root of the resources tree are the ores you extract from the asteroid tiles. Each tile produces one type of resource. You can click the Resources button on the right to see the resources around your landing ship, or use the astoanalyser to further explore the asteroid.\n\nA mine will extract the ore from the tile, but then it needs refining in another building before becoming really useful. Ice needs melting in an ice melter, iron converts to steel in a steel refinery, regolith becomes plastic when put through a regoplasticiser, and rare earth ore smelts into rare earth minerals.\n\nEach building needs energy, which must be produced by solar panels. At the end of every turn, energy not used gets thrown away. The Energy Production label tells you how much excess you are wasting at the moment.\n\nYou can get more colonists by providing enough excess food and water. Food is provided by providing water to a hydroponics building. If you are running out of room for colonists, you will need to build a habitat to house the new arrivals.\n\n**If you're struggling with the size of the UI and graphics, zooming in Chrome (and then possibly refreshing) will make everything larger, and still play fine.**\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/41c86198db78f9f3d3d798c8002cf02a.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=1921","author":{"name":"tenpn","uid":1921,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a31fbafa397845ab6ec33df5139ae589?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/tenpn/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1921-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1921-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1921-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1921-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1921-shot2.JPG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1921-shot2.JPG"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5/Javascript","url":"http://capsaicingames.github.com/ld48-23/"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/CapsaicinGames/ld48-23"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":72,"score":3.33},{"area":"overall","rank":91,"score":3.25},{"area":"innovation","rank":96,"score":3.17},{"area":"mood","rank":166,"score":2.55},{"area":"fun","rank":179,"score":2.5},{"area":"graphics","rank":190,"score":2.67},{"area":"audio","rank":193,"score":1.73},{"area":"humor","rank":225,"score":1.3},{"area":"coolness","rank":1074,"score":14}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Sneaking Guinea Pig","category":"compo","description":"Language: AS3\nIDE: FlashDevelop\n\nGFX: Paint Shop Pro 9.01\nGuinea pig photos: iPhone 3GS\n\nSound recording: Samsung Galaxy S Plus\nSound editing: Audacity\n\nTime spent: About 12 hours.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/1072b08419142d9f6373072f353e601f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=1908","author":{"name":"Dzarg","uid":1908,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c858dd9797c779305801664d1dad2e2?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/dzarg/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1908-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1908-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1908-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1908-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1908-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1908-shot2.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://velinen.fi/markku/ld23"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://velinen.fi/markku/ld23"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://velinen.fi/markku/ld23/src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":402,"score":3.1},{"area":"fun","rank":490,"score":2.7},{"area":"innovation","rank":492,"score":2.8},{"area":"overall","rank":604,"score":2.7},{"area":"audio","rank":640,"score":1.89},{"area":"graphics","rank":682,"score":2.4},{"area":"coolness","rank":1120,"score":10}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Squish","category":"jam","description":"How to play: Press the \"A\" and \"D\" keys to move, and space to jump.

They send wave after wave of evil beings to destroy you!  But something doesn't add up.  Their attacks are coordinated, and surprisingly effective -- the ancient gods are not usually this coordinated in their efforts.  \n\nSomething is directing them.  Will you survive long enough to uncover the truth?\n\nTiny Gods is my interpretation of the Tiny World theme for LD48.  Tiny Gods is  a 2D \"Bullet Hell\" game in the style of 1995-1998 SNES games.  In Tiny Gods, you are a new demi-god, but your powers are not yet stable and are easily influenced by your followers on all the worlds you find throughout the universe.  As a demi-god you can absorb worlds to give you ammunition to defeat your foes, or you can stay close to worlds that give you power.  You must constantly balance staying in the proximity of worlds (to absorb their influence) and consuming worlds (to give you ammunition).  But don't stay too close for too long -- the attacks of your foes will damage the worlds as well, changing them into Dead Worlds where the people follow the gods of the underworld -- Pluto and Proserpine.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/1d321757a2bf36636a56dc8b499d1cd6.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=4703","author":{"name":"Tulrath","uid":4703,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/032e7de41fde68588d7d95ad94d5db07?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/tulrath/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4703-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4703-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4703-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4703-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4703-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4703-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4703-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4703-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4703-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/4703-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/74664687/TinyGods_Tulrath.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/74664687/TinyGods/WebPlayer.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/74664687/TinyGods/Tiny_Gods.unitypackage"}],"ratings":[{"area":"humor","rank":573,"score":1.95},{"area":"audio","rank":638,"score":1.9},{"area":"theme","rank":723,"score":2.4},{"area":"innovation","rank":815,"score":2},{"area":"mood","rank":827,"score":1.87},{"area":"fun","rank":829,"score":1.87},{"area":"graphics","rank":866,"score":1.8},{"area":"overall","rank":871,"score":1.97},{"area":"coolness","rank":913,"score":28}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Atomswarm - Tiny Cycles","category":"compo","description":"Readme is included in the windows/mac versions\nYou can find me at my site - www.atomswarm.com","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/38bda1696a7382ceba5eadac8e00b25d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=5199","author":{"name":"chartinboy","uid":5199,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/36b33e62aea6a4aeb160d047b2bf9f4d?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/chartinboy/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/5199-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/5199-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1357028/Atomswarm%20tiny%20cycles%20windows%20build%20v1-0.rar"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1357028/Atomswarm%20tiny%20cycles%20mac.rar"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1357028/WebPlayer.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1357028/Source.rar"},{"label":"Readme","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1357028/README.txt"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":294,"score":3.29},{"area":"humor","rank":471,"score":2.14},{"area":"audio","rank":576,"score":2.11},{"area":"innovation","rank":666,"score":2.43},{"area":"graphics","rank":748,"score":2.24},{"area":"mood","rank":771,"score":2.07},{"area":"overall","rank":807,"score":2.29},{"area":"fun","rank":812,"score":1.95},{"area":"coolness","rank":851,"score":33}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Cereal Killer","category":"compo","description":"Defeating this game is a true feat of skill.

Each feature costs a different amount to produce.\n\nProduction slows to a total of 5 iterations, but can be restarted by building something new nearby.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nCities get more expensive each time you build one...\n\n...but cities are the only way of obtaining minerals (just build a city on top of some minerals).\n\nOver-arching progress is in accumulation of minerals. There are 50 mineral spots each time you play -- and they can be harvested by as many cities as you can get close enough (3 in most cases, 4 if you're very careful).\n\nBecause the cities get more expensive, your play tactics and overall strategy have to adapt during the course of play.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm enjoying the play curve, though looking forward to getting some feedback from others -- I've generally been using the following tactics:\n\n- leave gaps (go in and build hills there later to restart production)\n- cluster around dependencies (e.g. grass around water)\n- be patient (don't restart production until it's over, as you'll waste valuable cycles)\n- cities themselves can earn a lot of money, use them wisely (don't build just because you can)\n\nWould love to hear someone prove out the math at the top end -- I've played this through on the final build to just over 20 minerals.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nSome background on what was used:\n\n- Unity (first project in Unity -- generally pretty happy with it)\n- Propellerhead's Figure (iOS synth) + Audacity for the background music\n- Cfxr + Audactiy for the sound fx\n- \"Cheri\" font, Illustrator for instructions page\n- Lots of lemsips\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nEaster egg: if you're using WASD, you can also use Q and E to \"roll\" the tiny world.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/efff8ae1117e9c86aef509ab4bfd1dee.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=7693","author":{"name":"Gareth Jenkins","uid":7693,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/655fc147f3fb03ee38d8e17aac793059?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/garethjenkins/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7693-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7693-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7693-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7693-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7693-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7693-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7693-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7693-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows (32 bit)","url":"http://game.36peas.com/mineralcities/mineralcities-win32.zip"},{"label":"Windows (64 bit)","url":"http://game.36peas.com/mineralcities/mineralcities-win64.zip"},{"label":"Mac OS X","url":"http://game.36peas.com/mineralcities/mineralcities-osx.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://game.36peas.com/mineralcities/mcweb/mcweb.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://game.36peas.com/mineralcities/gj-ld23.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":94},{"area":"innovation","rank":97,"score":3.72},{"area":"theme","rank":164,"score":3.54},{"area":"overall","rank":185,"score":3.4},{"area":"mood","rank":248,"score":3.03},{"area":"audio","rank":264,"score":2.89},{"area":"graphics","rank":282,"score":3.22},{"area":"fun","rank":325,"score":3},{"area":"humor","rank":747,"score":1.52}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Molecules","category":"compo","description":"This is a game about molecules.

The faster you get them there, the more points, but any thing that leaves the world, or hits a non-corresponding large thing is lost.\n\nThere are two game modes:\n-Time attack mode, where you must collect as many points as possible in 2 minutes, disregarding lost things entirely\n-Score attack mode, where you die when you've lost 200 things.\n\n[NEW]\nIt seems the gameplay here is quite confusing, as even my brother upon vocal explanation and demonstration took two rounds to get it, so instead, I'll now go into excruciating detail. You're adviced to keep an eye on the screenshot as you read along.\nIn the middle of the screenshot there are two large circles (purble and red) that are filled. We call these two for \"Nodes\". The four large circles with dark spots \n(toruses) in the corners we call \"Warps\". All of these spawn, at fixed intervals, the smaller versions of each other we call \"Particles\". Nodes spawn paricles that correspond to warps, meaning they look the same, in the same color as the warp they correspond to. Warps spawn particles corresponding to either nodes or other waprs. Thus, something coming out of the center circles corresponds to one of the corners, but something coming out of the conrner may correspond to other corners as well as center circles.\nYou are in charge of uniting corresponding particles and nodes _and_ corresponding particles and warps. Any particle that appears it is your mission to get to the corresponsing Node or Warp. Keeping on top of that task is the game...\n\nYou do this task by \"boxing\" a set og particles (with LMB) and then routing them somewhere (with RMB). This alone will only get you so far though, as there are tricks to be employed. Once you have given a particle the order to go to it's corresponding node / warp it will speed up.\n\nThe rest of this section will describe one such trick:\nThe speed-up, coupled with the (Shift + RMB) \"append command\" functionality ( by holding down shift, and giving a series of points to visit, the particles will visit them in order all the way to the last one) allows you to group units together, string them around the world and towards one node/warp, at which point some of them will speed up, and the rest can be taken off crash course in time.\n[END NEW]\n\n::Controls::\n-Left mouse button : Selects things by DRAGGING THE SELECTION BOX OVER THEM, clicking will not work!\n-Right mouse buttons : Gives move-commands\n-Shift : Modifies the above as such:\n    LMB now extends the old selection with the new one\n    RMB adds that move-command after the last previous one given to that unit (used to create zig-zag routes)\n-Crtl + [0-9], Ctrl + [Num 0-9] / Ctrl + F1-F10 : Creates control group with selected things\n-0-9, Num 0-9, F1-F10 : Selects the corresponding control group\n-Space or P : Pauses/Unpauses the game\n-Escape : Closes the game from the menu, returns to manu from ingame\nThe following two are bugged, and should NOT be used (or be nescessary):\n-Mouse Wheel : Zoom\n-Mouse Wheel pressed + drag : Moves view\n\nAlso important:\nOnce a thing has been routed to it's correct destination, it will become slightly darker and speed up. This is so things don't get cluttered; you can still give it new orders.\n\n::Story::\nAlas, the (back)story fits neatly to an RTS game, not so much to this. But how is it related to \"Tiny world\" then, you say? Well, the universe is vast, size is perspective, and we only see a few objects somewhere in space, with nothing to relate their size to. For now, let's just assume they are tiny ;)\n\n::Comment::\nSee next post...\n\n::PS::\nThere was a massive bug in the first version, but this has now been fixed.\n\n::Linux Notes::\nSee readme included in tarball. Only 64-bit for now.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/84a90a972de3f545591f42ff829b819e.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=11885","author":{"name":"thynnmas","uid":11885,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ade78d35b6b9e07837d5f6544d48fcb3?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/thynnmas/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11885-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11885-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.schmidx2.com/Code/LD23_compo.zip"},{"label":"Linux (64-bit, incl. src)","url":"http://www.schmidx2.com/Code/LD23_compo_linux.tar.gz"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://youtu.be/dna2VDh6BR4"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.schmidx2.com/Code/LD23_compo_src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":75},{"area":"innovation","rank":346,"score":3.12},{"area":"audio","rank":581,"score":2.09},{"area":"humor","rank":607,"score":1.89},{"area":"mood","rank":636,"score":2.35},{"area":"fun","rank":645,"score":2.42},{"area":"theme","rank":692,"score":2.48},{"area":"overall","rank":727,"score":2.48},{"area":"graphics","rank":760,"score":2.21}],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Boxed","category":"compo","description":"Puzzle platformer based in two boxes, and each box contains the other box.

So, to end up the game (escape the cube); you need to complete the six levels (in the version i released for the compo, you can only play on level one and three). However, this is not a linear game, in each level you have what i called a \"console\" (a super interrupter) that needs a key to be activated, those key are hidden in levels. You start the game with the red key. To clear a level, you just need to find the \"super-interrupter\" and activate it.\nI hope it's clearer now : D","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/3c6cc034b65606f4466add281567c9dc.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=12915","author":{"name":"toadd-y","uid":12915,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/04b27149a34dae57caf1904b8e89ccdb?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/toadd-y/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12915-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12915-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12915-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12915-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12915-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12915-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12915-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12915-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://bngames.org/ludumdare"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://bngames.org/ludumdare/src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"humor","rank":453,"score":2.18},{"area":"overall","rank":524,"score":2.81},{"area":"fun","rank":524,"score":2.65},{"area":"mood","rank":543,"score":2.5},{"area":"graphics","rank":571,"score":2.62},{"area":"coolness","rank":670,"score":47},{"area":"theme","rank":700,"score":2.46},{"area":"innovation","rank":714,"score":2.31},{"area":"audio","rank":731,"score":1.33}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Ethereal Isles","category":"compo","description":"Drop monsters on a floating island to fight other monsters and conquer the island.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/f98119f094646b484991a0ca0f955148.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=11739","author":{"name":"Izzimach","uid":11739,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ac3aaf44a56cf4fef328b05bf6e3bb47?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/izzimach/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11739-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11739-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11739-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11739-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/19854223/EtherealIsles_PC.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/19854223/EtherealIsles_Mac.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://interstellarechidna.com/customhtml/EtherealIsles.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/19854223/EtherealIsles_Source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":50},{"area":"theme","rank":202,"score":3.47},{"area":"humor","rank":216,"score":2.72},{"area":"graphics","rank":257,"score":3.28},{"area":"innovation","rank":429,"score":2.93},{"area":"overall","rank":515,"score":2.83},{"area":"audio","rank":591,"score":2.05},{"area":"fun","rank":668,"score":2.38},{"area":"mood","rank":672,"score":2.29}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"In a Jam","category":"jam","description":"\"In a Jam\" was developed by Marco Vale and Pedro Santos\nThis was our first ever unity project and half the time spent during\nthe game jam was looking up videos and tutorials.\n\nThe game features a really small world, so small, it can hardly hold a single factory up straight.

Pushing the other player physically is allowed, but I'm not responsible for any injuries, broken computers or hurt feelings. \n\n(This combines Tiny World with Castles/Castles in the Sky/Build It, Then Use It/Limited Resources. Possible alternate title is Castles In The Sky Are Tiny Worlds Where You Build It, Then Use It With Limited Resources).","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/402024970e7fdfe3bf0105abf6ee152d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=8129","author":{"name":"ChrisWhitman","uid":8129,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/46e96d705241391038937d8c77fe0664?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/chriswhitman/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8129-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8129-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8129-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8129-shot1.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://christopherwhitman.net/games/TinyWorld/"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://christopherwhitman.net/games/TinyWorld/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":41,"score":4.16},{"area":"humor","rank":66,"score":3.37},{"area":"theme","rank":112,"score":3.68},{"area":"innovation","rank":193,"score":3.44},{"area":"overall","rank":325,"score":3.16},{"area":"fun","rank":325,"score":3},{"area":"mood","rank":366,"score":2.76},{"area":"audio","rank":565,"score":2.13},{"area":"coolness","rank":748,"score":41}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Out

It is your duty to annihilate them for some reason.\n\nThis is a game for the Commodore 64 made using the Shoot 'em up Construction Kit. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of Ludum Dare I decided to go back to my roots and make a game for my first computer :).\n\nIt's not very finished and therefore not very good even for a SEUCK game, but here it is anyway. I hope you manage to derive some fun from it.\n\nThe disk image contains both the game executable (\"Atomsmash\"), and the SEUCK data files (\"Atomsmash Data\"). You can load it on a C64 emulator or on a real C64, like I did :).\n\nEmulator instructions:\n\n1. Download CCS64 from http://www.ccs64.com/\n2. Run the emulator and drag the disk image into the emulator window.\n3. The disk boots and loads. The screen will flash different colours until this is done. This takes a minute or so since it's emulating the original floppy drive from 1982 :).\n4. While the game is loading you can configure an emulated input device. To do this:\n5.

They were made public for the huge modding community some years ago.\n\n\nThe concept:\n\nYou can either play the virus team or the immune system team (Main Menu > Settings!). You have two Computer players taking part in the game. One is neutral and controlled passively by the Immune System. This neutral Computer is the one that controls the leucocytes that are controlled by the interleucines (produced by the globulines) and will attack the cells that are under control by the virus team. The viruses spawn rate is higher than the spawn rate of the immune system, but virusses are stronger than globulines.\n\nThe immune system player is the one that is defensive, but he can also attack with \"Blitzkrieg\" strategy and making the virus team busy whilst using his leucocytes bonus.\n\nThe virus player is the one that is aggressive, he is the one that has to infect as much cells as possible. The more time he has, the stronger he gets and the harder it is for the counterpart to eliminate the virus player.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nHave a look at the settings, where you can set which team you want to play. Also, there is a PRO Mode for guys that enjoyed games like \"I wanna be the guy\" or SuperMeatBoy in the past :) You have to be really good and fast to have a chance against the computer counterpart. It automatically turns the tutorial at the beginning of.\n\nThe one that infects all cells has won. You've got to catch them all :)\n\n\nPOST-MORTEM-WORK:\n\nWell, I did a lot of refactoring the code meanwhile. The path algorithm behind is now much smarter and caches commonly used paths. Also, the clustering is now a self-generated cluster. There is no hitmap or collision model used by the path algorithm, I'm using an own path system here - because I think A-Star and common hitmaps are the false way to go. Meaning there are no manually set paths, everything generated by shapes. Play the roundabout skirmish map to see what's up :)\n\nThe AI / COM is also very smart. Now being able to be set to different modes (aggressive, defensive, passive) and with different strengths.\n\nAlso, I decided to move the levels to a campaign-style game. For now, only the Immune system's campaign is working - due to undone refactoring of code :)\n\nTake a look at the post-mortem game (requires a Web Console! Firefox + Firebug or Chrome or IE with F12 (DevTools)):\n\nhttp://martens.ms/lycheeJS/demo/game/immune/\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/fcf56efab29be997b8b858eda44fe869.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=10936","author":{"name":"martensms","uid":10936,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fb303b6fe3ed7652d78bc5b0a648476d?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/martensms/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10936-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10936-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (Compo)","url":"http://martens.ms/ld23/demo/game/immune/"},{"label":"Web (Up2date)","url":"http://martens.ms/lycheeJS/demo/game/immune/"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/martensms/lycheeJS/tree/master/demo/game/immune"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":342,"score":3.2},{"area":"innovation","rank":355,"score":3.1},{"area":"audio","rank":487,"score":2.33},{"area":"mood","rank":529,"score":2.54},{"area":"overall","rank":604,"score":2.7},{"area":"fun","rank":728,"score":2.25},{"area":"humor","rank":737,"score":1.56},{"area":"graphics","rank":821,"score":2},{"area":"coolness","rank":936,"score":26}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Little Locations","category":"compo","description":"Travel through four tiny worlds.

You may choose to reverse the effect by punishing (to counter good) or blessing (countering bad) the structure. Blessings will give you a short-term boost in wisdom income, but a long-term *loss* in wisdom income (translated as \"people are inspired by their god's actions, but grow quick to expect it all too often\"). Punish should not be used (it destroys output both during and after because of feature-creep in dev time).\n\nUpgrading: you can only upgrade one building in a category at any one time, but several categories may be upgraded simultaneously. For example, you may not upgrade two schools, but you may upgrade a castle and a school. All remaining buildings in the same category are upgraded (the new knowledge spreads) once the first completes. ** Upgrade speed is determined by the building's wisdom output. **\n\nNew buildings are created as existing buildings of the same category reach a certain stage of maturity (hidden value). This process is automatic.\n\nTechnical note: if I recall (it's 3.30 in the morning, bear with me), you need at least Flash 10.2 to run the game - I don't think I bumped it to 11.2 just because I \"could\".\n\nHotfix version uploaded and github pushed (so you can verify the minimal change yourself if desired).

Each facility produce something depending on the amount of workers, houses produce more workers (if you know what I mean ;) ).\n\nThe rest I'm leaving to you to find by yourself :)\n\nNOTICE: there are problems with loading (on OS X especially) and I don't know why, sorry.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a0abe9055e6c29010b9c4ce059d9bf4f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=2185","author":{"name":"Vladp995","uid":2185,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c3c977d6b546bc538aa47413431dba0c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/vladp/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/2185-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/2185-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~vladis2/LD23.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~vladis2/LD23.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"audio","rank":211,"score":1.14},{"area":"humor","rank":223,"score":1.43},{"area":"graphics","rank":233,"score":2.13},{"area":"mood","rank":235,"score":1.58},{"area":"innovation","rank":237,"score":1.96},{"area":"overall","rank":241,"score":2.09},{"area":"fun","rank":246,"score":1.75},{"area":"theme","rank":247,"score":1.83},{"area":"coolness","rank":688,"score":46}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Downsize the World!","category":"compo","description":"Economy is getting worse and worse, not even the gods of ...whatever are able to go about their business without cutting costs.

By pressing space you release eggs from the bird.\n\n2. These eggs are blue,green,brown and gold and will produce water,grass,dirt and humans.\n\n3. You can then further drop eggs on these to create new stuff, such as a tent is created by dropping grass on a human.\n\n4. A tent can then be used to score by raising it up via dropping grass on it.\n\n5. Evil ghosts will kill the humans and the tent, but can be disposed with eggs.\n\n6. The game can end in 2 ways: you can run out of eggs or one of the ground blocks touches the bird.\n\nThere is no game over screen, so whatever score you have when the bird dies or you run out of eggs is your final score :)\n\nThe game uses the brilliant html5 engine Impact\nhttp://impactjs.com\n\nThe music and (shockingly beautiful) art were all made by me. The game and story are loosely based on finnish folklore creation myth and Kalevala.\n\nDespite some bugs I am very happy with what I got together.\nI hope you enjoy the game.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/9e4fe1ed57e916bc54f3dae92751cad9.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=8333","author":{"name":"gnx","uid":8333,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/024d2c2c9df1ea197a90b9a98cb53ad9?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/gnx/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8333-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8333-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://akseli.virtuaalipalvelin.net/iati/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":94},{"area":"innovation","rank":16,"score":3.89},{"area":"mood","rank":77,"score":3.13},{"area":"theme","rank":106,"score":3.09},{"area":"fun","rank":113,"score":2.83},{"area":"overall","rank":115,"score":3.11},{"area":"audio","rank":118,"score":2.92},{"area":"humor","rank":177,"score":1.92},{"area":"graphics","rank":234,"score":2.11}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Lost Oxide","category":"compo","description":"Note: Runs best with Chrome!\n\nThis is my entry for Ludum Dare 23.

I hope you enjoy it.\n\n\"Joe The Alien\" is a 2.5D platformer in cartoon style. I'm not the best graphics guy but I did my best.\n\nThe game has also a little story about Joe and his unnamed friend. Their UFO broke and the had to make an emergency landing onto the earth!\n\nMaking this game took about twenty hours. I used GLBasic because it's a wonderful language for rapid game prototyping and has a powerful 2D and 3D engine included.\n\nFor 3D modelling and texturing I use Milkshape 3D. For 2D graphics I mainly used Paint.NET but also a little bit of Adobe Photoshop (the titlescreen for example). For sound I used sfxr and for music... wait there is no music at all... I can't make music :(. For planning I used a piece of paper and a pen (what a surprise!).\n\nDevelopment was stright forward. There was only one badass bug which didn't want to get fixed (took around 4 hours :(...) Now I hope the game is bugfree, but I don't think so.\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b69446c3a3518354ef9fe8bb5540cd4b.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=11847","author":{"name":"coolo","uid":11847,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e0d4c1ca1b58d0efb5d2323a8d6641d1?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/coolo/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11847-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11847-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11847-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11847-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11847-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11847-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11847-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11847-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11847-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/11847-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.programming-with-design.at/files/LD23/JoeTheAlien_Win.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://www.programming-with-design.at/files/LD23/JoeTheAlien_MacOSX.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://www.programming-with-design.at/files/LD23/JoeTheAlien_Linux.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.programming-with-design.at/files/LD23/JoeTheAlien_Source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":222,"score":3.36},{"area":"fun","rank":232,"score":3.18},{"area":"mood","rank":252,"score":3},{"area":"overall","rank":308,"score":3.18},{"area":"theme","rank":354,"score":3.18},{"area":"humor","rank":426,"score":2.22},{"area":"audio","rank":511,"score":2.27},{"area":"innovation","rank":658,"score":2.45},{"area":"coolness","rank":1074,"score":14}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"My Little Dungeon","category":"jam","description":"My Little Dungeon is an indirect RPG. In this game you don't control the hero directly but rather build a dungeon for him to go through. Ultimately you want him to gain enough strength to enter the \"Tiny World\" and solve its mysteries.. Though you have to be careful, if you push him too much you'll kill  your hero!\n\nHave a quick read through the instructions but most of it should be self-explanatory. The game can be beat! You might have to try a few different strategies though.\n\nThe download is an executable JAR. In Windows just double click the file. On Mac/Linux should be able to run it with: \"java -jar MyLittleDungeon.jar\". Make sure you have JAVA installed! Any problems let us know. And yes, you have to restart the app if you die. Sorry :( \n\nWeb version should run in any modern web browser that supports WebGl.\n\nControls\n********\nLeft Mouse: Place rooms\nRight Mouse (Web: S): Switch room type\nMouse Wheel (Web: A&D): Change room size\nEnter/Space: Go down one level\n\nRooms\n*****\nStone Room: Easy enemies, low loot drop\nRed Sandstone Room: Harder enemies, better loot drop\nCave: Gives your hero a break and regenerates hp + fatigue\n\nAttributes\n**********\nHP: Your hero's health\nFatigue/Food: Keep this high or the hero will die\nShield/Attack: Explains itself\nXP: Current xp\nLVL: Current lvl\nGold: How much Gold you have left. You'll need gold to build rooms!\n\n********\n\nThis game was developed by Stefan Bachmann, Simon Bachmann and Gavin Harrison in less than 72hrs. We hope you enjoy the game!\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/98b41962fb784c36230619b2d0bd1d18.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=12111","author":{"name":"thegreystudios","uid":12111,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3cb3ff6f4890e4c8179fee56e09ee8d6?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/thegreystudios/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12111-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12111-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12111-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12111-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.thegreystudios.com/MyLittleDungeon/MyLittleDungeon.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://www.thegreystudios.com/MyLittleDungeon/MyLittleDungeon.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://www.thegreystudios.com/MyLittleDungeon/MyLittleDungeon.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://thegreystudios.com/MyLittleDungeon/html5/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"innovation","rank":4,"score":4.15},{"area":"overall","rank":11,"score":4},{"area":"fun","rank":20,"score":3.68},{"area":"graphics","rank":20,"score":4.31},{"area":"audio","rank":27,"score":3.79},{"area":"mood","rank":32,"score":3.57},{"area":"humor","rank":107,"score":2.5},{"area":"theme","rank":160,"score":2.77}],"platforms":["desktop","web","java"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"One Room War","category":"jam","description":"Fight in a small, slightly colorful room with infinite enemies and powerups that they can also steal (QUICK GET IT BEFORE IT'S TO LATE!)\n\nMade hastily by Phobos001, music by wandschrank","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a7b42bfee10a7449a6d0f68c80ae215d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=12851","author":{"name":"Phobos001","uid":12851,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fca5bfd204cb04f07588c2448ae4a47c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/phobos001/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12851-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12851-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/21499454/ORW.zip"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV3c2r_jlOI&feature=youtu.be"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/21499454/src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1074,"score":14}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"One-way Ticket To Space Train","category":"compo","description":"Had fun, more to come.\n\nCheck out more info at the web page or follow the project later.\n\nThanks!\n\nUpdate 1:\n- Probably won't work on IE since the game requires SVG support!\n- Also as a hint, you need to turn on the life support.

I will try (on Monday) to convert the game to Windows as soon as possible.\nWhen you finish the game the Virtual Machine Editor is unlocked and available to modify the game. ;-)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/164c2ae388c87a421aaf9f3ed0affdb0.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=8583","author":{"name":"Pavel Dlouhy","uid":8583,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d1b2df9d20f24a73e92e5ae0f09a4d6e?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/paveldlouhy/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8583-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8583-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8583-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8583-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8583-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8583-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8583-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8583-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8583-shot4.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8583-shot4.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/43382869/TWAdventure.app.zip"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/43382869/TWAdventure.exe"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VeU-QwtOsk"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/43382869/TWAdventure_src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":50},{"area":"innovation","rank":55,"score":3.89},{"area":"overall","rank":231,"score":3.32},{"area":"mood","rank":234,"score":3.05},{"area":"graphics","rank":429,"score":2.89},{"area":"humor","rank":431,"score":2.21},{"area":"theme","rank":595,"score":2.68},{"area":"fun","rank":607,"score":2.5}],"platforms":["mac","desktop","win"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Tinyvilization","category":"compo","description":"Welcome Settler\nYour civilization \"Wide Blue\" just arrived on this new tiny world.

Calculate the power of the attack (Value of the card times the energy spent)\n2. Apply special cases (see below)\n3. The stronger attack wins and the difference will be subtracted from the loser's health.\n\n=========== SPECIAL CASES ===========\n\n1. If the two elements are the same, no modification of the attack value happens here.\n2. If one of the attack is colored, its attack value is multiplied by 2.\n3. If you fight against a weak element, the attack power of the weak element is added to yours. (you \"absorb\" the attack) This also means that the enemy's attack power is zeroed out.\n\n=========== BATTLE EXAMPLES ===========\n\n3 Energy, 2 Fire vs. 1 Energy, 1 Fire\n\nSteps (see above):\n1. 6 Power vs. 1 Power\n2.

To do so, simply take over every planet in each level.\n\nControls:\nListed in game via tutorial.\nMove around by clicking on the minimap or by using the WASD/arrow keys. The minimap shows planets and your current viewport only. This is an RTS so you must watch your resources carefully while fending off the AI or attacking a planet it controls. Build oil rigs to get money, and build turrets or HP regeneration stations as defensive buildings. The only moving unit is the fighter.\n\nClick and drag to select fighters, right click a planet to make them travel there. They will attack enemies automatically and attempt to take over neutral or enemy planets.\n\nIn total there are 9 levels. The AI may either crush you or you it. In general, the AI is most often conservative in the beginning and when it builds up a fleet will send them out.\n\nCheats:\nNumpad +/- to switch levels.\n\nCreated with the help of the following tools:\nGameMaker:HTML5\nGIMP\nAudacity\nBFXR\nLMMS\n\nTHERE IS A WEB VERSION OF THIS GAME, HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:\nREALLY IMPORTANT: The tutorial under the \"How\" button does not correctly draw the first screen of the tutorial. When you press that button and get sent to a blank blue screen, PRESS THE SPACEBAR to continue. The missing screen basically summarizes the information given in these notes.\n\nChrome has a bug that prevents the game from running normally, it wants to run twice as fast as I designed the game to run. I was kind of able to hack around this limitation, but the result was making Chrome run even slower and more choppy than other browsers.\n\nThis game is HTML5/Javascript. It supports both WebGL and canvas for maximum performance and compatibility. HTML5 is a new technology and there are many differences between browsers (for instance, how shapes and sprites look).\n\nThis game can get quite intensive and may run poorly on slower machines. If you have any problems with the web version, PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE WINDOWS VERSION.\n\n4/24 - Added timelapse. May be 360p for a while.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ed7ff6b7b407fd8a9ec5a377bf51a11c.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=383","author":{"name":"Daz","uid":383,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3ce7610db8af6f742295b83ecd6000f5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/daz/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/383-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/383-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://pwna.net/scratch/tiny/"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://pwna.net/scratch/tiny/Tiny%20Domination.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://pwna.net/scratch/tiny/Tiny%20Domination%20Source.zip"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://youtu.be/Gpd7dHOYlU8"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":56},{"area":"theme","rank":212,"score":3.45},{"area":"overall","rank":231,"score":3.32},{"area":"fun","rank":297,"score":3.06},{"area":"graphics","rank":332,"score":3.09},{"area":"innovation","rank":419,"score":2.96},{"area":"mood","rank":543,"score":2.5},{"area":"audio","rank":599,"score":2},{"area":"humor","rank":666,"score":1.76}],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Tiny Ferrets","category":"compo","description":"made in game maker.

Population growth combined with resource decline will drain what we have very shortly, we must expand! You must send as many refuges away from Earth as you can, before the planet is dead and humankind with it. Oh, and you have, like, 3 minutes.\n\n\nHow to play:\nAs soon as you pop into the game, Earth is quickly becoming a wasteland. \n\nA/D/Left/Right: Move left/right along the solar system.\nSpace: Launch a rocketship with colonists from Earth\nS: Launch a seed ship with resources from Earth\n(debug) P: Restart game, so you don't have to close/reopen\n\nThe Point:\nSave as many people from Earth as possible, the game ends when Earth dies. Your score is the number (in Millions) of people who are not on Earth at that time. People in ships don't count (to prevent cheating by launching to nowhere at the last moment). Have it planned. The game is meant to be played in about 2-3 minute attempts.\n\n\nSadly, I did not finish what I set out to do. I did not have the time on Sunday I had planned, so now I am releasing what I have. It is \"gameplay complete\", it plays, and there is a start and finish. \n\nWhat isn't included:\nSound\nMusic\nHigh score keeping\nHelp instructions\nAesthetics (proper graphics, backgrounds)\nBetter UI\n\n\nI (luckily) had prototyped out my game on Saturday, so the gameplay is actually there.\n\nWhat is included:\nWindows executable and source code, of course.

The aim is to create worms with specific patterns by feeding them the right coloured food in the right order.  They have a habit of turning at the wrong time though or eating the wrong coloured food.\n\n Instructions\n\n-Left click drops food.\n-The colour of the next piece of food in shown in the bottom right hand corner.\n-When a worm eats a piece of food that colour is added to the front of their body.\n-The worm you are trying to match the colours of is in the bottom left hand corner.\n-Your score is shown on the left and the time remaining on the right\n-Matching a worm gives you points and more time\n-When the timer reaches zero its game over.\n\n Hints\n\nWhen worms get older / longer they die and make way for new worms.  Try to feed longer worms to get rid of them quicker to make way for smaller worms.\n\nThe sequence of colours must be in the correct order from front to back. If you have to create a match to a worm with a red head and blue tail first find a single blue worm.  Then feeding it one piece of red food will create a match.\n\nThe worms move at different speeds.  Try and find slower worms to feed for matches and try and get rid of fater worms by feeding them up quickly.\n\n\nUPDATE :  \n\nIt seems my instruction wrinting skills are weak. I knew the game was fiddly to play but I didn't realise the concept was tricky that tricky to grasp. I will try and describe it again now I have had more sleep.   \n\nThere is a worm shown in a box the bottom left corner. The aim is to feed the worms randomly milling around the screen to that they match the length and colours of the worm in the box.  \n\nYou can't control worms directly but you can drop food in front of them to feed them. The next colour food in displayed in the bottom right. So if you have to match a worm that has a red head and a blue tail you need to find a worm that is just a single blue dot and feed it some red food. You will then get points and more time for getting a match and another target worm for you to try and match will appear in the bottom left hand corner.

I'm sure there are probably ones I don't even know of, seeing as I am submitting this with... uh, like 5 minutes left.\n\nIt was kind of rushed, but the core engine is complete- there is one flying enemy, one walking enemy and about 10 level maps. All of these elements undergo randomization that is derived from a seed you enter at the start of the game. Also, it will tell you letters and numbers are allowed in the seed, but only letters are currently. This will be fixed soon of course but it really shouldn't matter anyway.\n\nThe game is completable, although you will certainly notice the dearth of content. I opted to make a single enemy of each variety (walking, flying and boss) and in the end that was all I had time for- even then I had to rush. Alas. I suppose that's what I get for beginning a whole 24 hours late.\n\nI got a bunch of help on this from my friends Marius Schneider, Zachery Delafosse, and Benjamin Pullen.\n\nThis is made in Game Maker, so it's windows only right now.\n\nCheck out the readme for controls and basic story info! \n\nUses the SGAudio DLL for game maker by snake5: http://gmc.yoyogames.com/index.php?showtopic=506072\n\n**** WHAT IS THE PIONEER? ****\n\nIt's a game about a supernatural little being who goes between tiny planets in space and exterminates the monsters that inhabit them. My idea with this was that the \"tiny world\" concept could translate into a lot of small, separate places conveyed in a screen-based platformer.\n\nThe design for the final version of the game is kind of leaned towards being an almost roguelike sort of escapade- the rooms are not actually randomly generated, but based on set skeletal structures with lots of points of articulation.\n\nIn every map there are bits of solid and stuff that might not appear, enemy slots that have a higher chance of being filled the further on into the play session the player is, etc. There are also twelve color palettes and four tilesets that skin themselves over the levels.\n\nSpeaking of the randomized features, they aren't all purely aesthetic- the monsters, in particular, all level up as the player survives longer. These levels give them points that they allocate into statistics and abilities- giving them more survivability through hit points, dole out harder damage to the player, or move faster. The skill builds are not global between all monsters of a single type, but rather become randomized on each level- slimes could be very fast and jump between the floor and ceiling in one stage, and be very slow with a lot of HP on the next.\n\nAgain I am highly disappointed that I couldn't work fast enough to supply more content than what's available here, but I hope the barren framework and concept is enough to catch your interest to watch its further developments. There are a lot of different enemies planned; teleporting wizards with ranged attacks, skeletons that try to get to you, a wheel-shaped creature with four legs that travels along all sides of solid surfaces, and a lot more. More player abilities are also to come in a more fleshed out release, such as lava resistance, slow-fall and a few other neat things.\n\nMore features and tons of content are definitely in store for this game, so please keep watching if it has caught your interest!\n\nI had a lot of fun working quickly to meet a deadline and I'll definitely want to get a better head-start on the next Ludum Dare!\n\n**** UPDATE: POST-JAM VERSION 1 ****\n\nThis is not a greatly fleshed out version of what was first released, but it does have a few things brushed up: the environment tileset composed of blocks has been redone and looks nicer, levels with unfair jumps were tweaked to be easier and you can now restart the game [bypassing the logo + sound] after you die or win by pressing enter.\n\nThe end-screen restart was supposed to be in for the initial release, but a small coding error caused it to make the audio DLL freak out and produce a lot of loud, weird glitchy noises... so I, unfortunately, had to temporarily pull it.\n\nThere's still more to come for this game!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/3b939ef2785bca4731fcb5e2ef487c18.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=811","author":{"name":"Moth","uid":811,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3664fd1937bdf85441dd53fb6e5a4e6d?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/moth/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/811-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/811-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/811-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/811-shot1.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/811-shot2.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/811-shot2.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/811-shot3.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/811-shot3.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.dopterra.com/imagedump/thepioneer.rar"},{"label":"Windows Post-Jam (INCLUDES DEATH RESTART FUNCTION)","url":"http://www.dopterra.com/imagedump/thepioneer_postjam.rar"},{"label":"Website!

I started about halfway through the competition, so it's rough around the edges, but it's a fun little game/toy with an elaborate simulation driving it. \n\nConstruct a small ecosystem out of terrain tiles and place animals into the world. When you click \"Lock In\", the game of survival begins. \n\nBalance is key: too many hares on a tile and they will reduce the rate at which edible plants grow. Too many foxes on a tile and they'll hunt the hares to extinction. No hares for the foxes and they'll starve. \n\nWhen the simulation is complete, you will receive points for each surviving animal: 5 points for a fox and 1 for a hare. The highest score on each puzzle is recorded. There are 12 puzzles for you to try.\n\nHope you enjoy playing!  =)\n\n- Truce\n\n\nTL;DR - Drag land tiles and animal tokens to complete the map, click Lock In.

The game's tactics thus depend on waiting for a good launch window, as ships that go farther are weaker. There were a few things planned that didn't get in, like some pretty planet graphics and a mechanic involving affecting planetary orbits, but I'm just happy to have actually finished a game this time.\n\nInstructions:\nWelcome to Tiny War. You play as green. The goal of the game is to send ships out and destroy blue. To attack a planet, drag from a planet you have ships on to a planet you want to send them to. This will send some ships from each planet you dragged over to the one you ended on. A fleet of ships loses strength the longer it's in space, so try to time your movement to take advantages of differing orbits. Your ships and your enemy's ships will destroy each other if they are on the same planet. The number of ships on a planet is indicated by the numbers above and below it. When your ships are the only ones on the planet, they will begin to capture it at a rate proportional to their number. Once a planet is captured, it will have a white ring when selected, and will begin producing ships. Bigger planets take longer to capture but produce ships faster. Press space to give up the level, and 'd' to turn on demo mode. Try to beat the AI and win the game!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d8c30b3579e3ebf2f0bb6ab191174d92.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=1634","author":{"name":"VDOgamez","uid":1634,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a8fa8e255218edc635fbeab7cb7a5c88?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/vdogamez/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1634-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/1634-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/43052873/LD23/TinyWar.swf"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/43052873/LD23/LD23.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":71},{"area":"fun","rank":214,"score":3.21},{"area":"innovation","rank":362,"score":3.09},{"area":"overall","rank":364,"score":3.09},{"area":"theme","rank":450,"score":3},{"area":"mood","rank":543,"score":2.5},{"area":"audio","rank":786,"score":1.07},{"area":"humor","rank":793,"score":1.29},{"area":"graphics","rank":837,"score":1.95}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Tiny World","category":"jam","description":"Tiny World By Carter Patterson\n\nNOTE: currently I only have the source code release, you will need a Java \neditor such as netbeans or eclips to run this.

You can return to the honeycomb at any time to drop off pollen and recharge your energy, but you may run out of time if you waste it carelessly and return too often.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/808745eb35363ae34d97b58af5d798cb.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=12184","author":{"name":"CappaGames","uid":12184,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4afc47306e0f362d859bf9aad69e6811?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/cappagames/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12184-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12184-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12184-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12184-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12184-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12184-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/25799547/honeyheist.zip"},{"label":"Microsoft XNA 4.0","url":"http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=20914"},{"label":"Microsoft .NET 4","url":"http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17851"},{"label":"WP7- Post Compo","url":"http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/apps/e7ed19f1-b7f5-43fa-90d6-2b2212f1a312"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"theme","rank":134,"score":2.94},{"area":"innovation","rank":143,"score":2.82},{"area":"graphics","rank":151,"score":3},{"area":"fun","rank":156,"score":2.63},{"area":"overall","rank":157,"score":2.82},{"area":"mood","rank":172,"score":2.51},{"area":"audio","rank":191,"score":1.77},{"area":"humor","rank":198,"score":1.81}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"It's a crazy tiny world after all !","category":"compo","description":"You versus it's a tiny world's attraction.\nKill those dolls before they make you too stressed out!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/70cc9feabd0d9f26dbc461f5f83107ef.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=3757","author":{"name":"krelix","uid":3757,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/44dc7f5139e396ea80f6b9ea325ab72e?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/krelix/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3757-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3757-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3757-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3757-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3757-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3757-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3757-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/3757-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.kongregate.com/games/Xilerk/its-a-crazy-tiny-world-ld-23"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.kongregate.com/games/Xilerk/its-a-crazy-tiny-world-ld-23"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://github.com/Krelix/LDEntry"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1178,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"microchip","category":"compo","description":"You a creature in small world of the microchip.

First of all is the unit movement. Due to limited time and complexity of the movement, units are fairly solitary and will queue up all attempting to reach the same spot without flocking around the target position.\n\nSecondly is the simplicity. I'd have liked to add more types of units, better upgrades, more balanced upgrade system, building more units, strategic enemies, etc.\n\nLast off all is community.

I have never made a game before, so this was an interesting adventure and I learned quite a bit; so I am pleased. I have heard before that the first game a person makes should be an MMO, and that makes a lot of sense really. So I made an MMO!\n\nAdhering to the Tiny World theme, this is a tiny MMO (as far as MMOs go). As small as possible, actually, since to be fair I have no experience in making MMOs. Or any kind of game for that matter. I made the game with JavaScript and HTML to make playing it more accessible [it is, afterall, an MMO!].\n\nThe client was made with the following dependencies:\n-Twitter's Bootstrap CSS library\n-John Resig's JQuery JavaScript library\n-Guillermo Rauch's Socket.IO JavaScript library\n-Tomas Pettersson's sfxr\n\nAnd on the server, I used:\n-Ryan Dahl's node.js server\n-TJ Holowaychuk's Express plugin for node.js\n-Guillermo Rauch's Socket.IO plugin for node.js\n-Tom Gallacher's gzippo plugin for node.js\n-Ben Smawfield's Sanitizer plugin for node.js\n\nThanks to all the above people!\n\nIn the game, you play as a single coloured pixel in a small 2D world. Your goal as a pixel is simply to kill players of colours other than your own. In addition to this core Player-vs-Player mechanic, the game features real-time world chat so that you may taunt your opponents!\n\nI hope the game's server does not catch fire while I sleep.\n\nGood night, tiny world.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/37f8caf4138d545bec8fee3f2ed7b1b9.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=12606","author":{"name":"Daniel","uid":12606,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/735a99c390832d0eb27b0fd1f3226f14?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/daniel/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12606-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12606-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12606-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12606-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://24.52.221.114/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://24.52.221.114/PixelMMO.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":57,"score":3.88},{"area":"humor","rank":330,"score":2.43},{"area":"theme","rank":366,"score":3.16},{"area":"overall","rank":483,"score":2.88},{"area":"fun","rank":596,"score":2.52},{"area":"audio","rank":599,"score":2},{"area":"mood","rank":618,"score":2.38},{"area":"coolness","rank":688,"score":46},{"area":"graphics","rank":793,"score":2.12}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"SUBPIXEL","category":"compo","description":"Entry by cr0ybot (Cory Hughart)\n@cr0ybot on twitter\n\nThis Tiny World is the world of subpixels, the tiny red, green, and blue parts that make up the millions of pixels on your monitor.\n\nTools:\nFlashDevelop\nFlixel\nPhotoshop\nBfxr\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\nMatch subpixels to form a whole pixel (RGB in any order horizontally)\n\nUse your mouse to aim, and use WASD or arrow keys or the mouse wheel to change to different sides of the screen.\n\nCurrently there is no logic for when a subpixel goes out of the bounding area... nor is there an explicit \"endgame\", so venture at your own risk.\n\nApologies for no music.

The most unlikely places of all for life.\n\nYou must now help one of those lifeforms to survive by killing the big bad boss that have emerged from the back, dark side of the robot.\n\nBut how can you do that? The only things these lifeforms can do is play music and dance to it.\n\nLuckily, almost all lifeforms on the robot's body cannot resist the dancing rythms. They are all children of the DiscoDroid...\n\n\n===== CONTROLS =====\nUse the arrow keys to move.\n\nPress and hold \"D\" to play music. Enemies close to you will dance and follow your moves. Hold down \"F\" at the same time and your violent enemies can be used to do the fighting for you!\n\nGather enemies to fight the final boss in the fortress!!!\n\n===== HELP =====\n\nWatch the playthrough video if you can't figure out how to kill the boss (or not able to run the game at all).\n\nGood luck!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a0fa22c10fed34554a9483874625d676.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=6781","author":{"name":"Per","uid":6781,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d11619a5a91ab55825a0dff93a5753c6?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/krasse/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/6781-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/6781-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web + source","url":"http://wonderfl.net/c/7fbr"},{"label":"Improved Version","url":"http://www.springworldgames.com/cod"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.springworldgames.com/ld23/Main.as"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0040HCQCQc"},{"label":"Playthrough","url":"http://youtu.be/1CVwv3KeApU"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":50},{"area":"humor","rank":111,"score":3.12},{"area":"innovation","rank":271,"score":3.28},{"area":"graphics","rank":423,"score":2.9},{"area":"audio","rank":576,"score":2.11},{"area":"overall","rank":639,"score":2.66},{"area":"fun","rank":685,"score":2.34},{"area":"mood","rank":757,"score":2.09},{"area":"theme","rank":873,"score":1.79}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"DANCING NINJA!","category":"jam","description":"TOTO DI MAMMA GOES TO THE CLUB!\n\nIt's dancing time!

It's possible I was a little over-ambitious this time.  But given everything, I'm very pleased with my results.  This is an HTML 5 game, and you need webGl to be able to play it.  I apologize if you're not webGl enabled :(  This can be a bit of a beast even on webGl accelerated machines.  My hope after this Ludum Dare is to learn a lot more about streamlining for framerate and performance.\n\n  In Slime Buster Micro, you play as John Pompadour.  You must rid the world of slime.

I would have liked to design some levels and add more backstory, but I'm pretty happy with what I've got.  Thanks, Static Void Games, for hosting!  Code was done in Java, graphics in Photoshop.\n\nI've added a gameplay details document to try to make the game more playable, less confusing.  This is post-compo.\n\nWith this game I wanted to experiment with an idea that has been kicking around in my head for a while, temporal portals.  I imagined you having a barrier in your way, but then a portal opens up and your future self emerges, presses a button that clears the barrier, then returns.  You then go through the cleared barrier, create a portal and go back in time to clear that barrier for yourself before moving on.\n\nIt seems to me that you need to be able to create portals  from the future at any time, but with each portal you are also creating a 'promise' that in the future you will enter a portal to the past.  I wanted to add something that would individualize the players, something that could change with them over time. I chose hats because they were easy to implement (the same hat graphic is used for facing left right and down, it almost worked when facing up, but it didn't cover the guy's bald spot.) So, when a player with a hat portals in, you have to fulfill the promise by portaling out a (different) player with a hat. \n\nI realized that this might cause paradoxes and introduced code to prevent that, which ultimately made the game very confusing.  I wanted to be able to play back the path of the one character through time, so you watch him go through each portal until he finally finishes the room.  If the 'promises' were not filled, then this sequence could not be constructed.  I considered adding in 'cameos' to fix hat/no hat problems (the player enters a portal, then you see him inside the time portal and finds a hat floating in  the inter-spacetime void, which he takes before returning to the real world) but I thought that putting the responsibility for avoiding paradoxes on the player would make a more interesting game.  That idea clearly needs to be re-examined post-mortem.\n\nPlease let me know what parts are confusing or what parts you have a good feel for. Thanks for playing!

You can get rocks by destroying meteors (follow the brown arrow).  Be careful not to let any meteors hit your planet when it is small as it will break apart.  Once a planet is finished you can start another one.  A planet is finished by adding five clouds to it.  Clouds are added by finding ice blocks (follow the blue arrows, they are only available once your planet is a certain size) and throwing them at your planet.  Clouds will cause grass to grow which will earn you more points.

I hope you can figure out how to play, I don't really have time to explain much here...\nAlright, here's where the original notes section ends and my first bit of free time since the actual competition begins. That's right - I'm going to put instructions in this notes section. Maybe I'll even make an extended version, but don't count on it.\n\nWhen you open the game, you'll see a title screen with some navigation buttons. If you don't know what to do here, you shouldn't be judging video games. Oh! You should probably go into the difficulty levels and choose \"Easy\", because \"Normal\" is really hard and \"Hard\" is absolutely impossible.\nWhen you start the actual game, you'll see an orange planet. Some rabbits will start popping up. I originally intended for these rabbits to have some significance, but all they actually do is get in your way and never die.\nOn either side there's a blue menu bar. At the top of the left one, it lists how much of each resource you have. From top to bottom, these are: money, the dust the planet is made of, metal, stone, glass, wood, and dirt. At the bottom of all these is the CO2 and oxygen percentages in the atmosphere - it should be 50-50 right now, I decided to make it say that when the planet has no atmosphere at all. As I recall, the atmosphere has to be at least two-thirds oxygen for you to be able to win, but you should aim to keep it as high as possible to be safe. I always find this to be very easy, so don't worry about it too much.\nOn the right menu bar, there are a bunch of pictures of buildings. If you hover your mouse over one it will say how much of each resource it will take to make it. If you click it, a picture of that type of building will start following your mouse. Click to build it. (Clicking off the planet will make the building disappear if you want to select something.) You can't build on another building or on rabbits. (Fun fact: making this mechanic took up a great deal of my time, and I only realized later that it was rather useless.) From left to right, top to bottom, these building are:\n-   House - you need a certain amount to win the game. Make as many as you can and upgrade them fully, because this amount is rather difficult to reach.\n-   Dust Digger - gives you dust over time, gives you more dust depending on its upgrade level. Dust is the most important resource in the game!\n-   Glass Factory - Turns dust into glass over time. Glass is required to make and upgrade houses, so these are important. It's also important because it puts CO2 out into the atmosphere, and trees will not grow without CO2. They pollute more and make glass faster when they are upgraded. \n-   Some Trees - These are probably the most interesting buildings in the game. They are not random, like the other buildings; they steadily grow, converting CO2 into oxygen as they do, until they run out of CO2 or become as tall as possible. Once they become this tall, they will stop growing but continue to convert CO2 to oxygen. Trees cannot be upgraded.\n-   Sawmill - Cuts down nearby trees for wood. Taller trees yield more wood. Cuts faster when upgraded.\n-   Composter - Converts wood to dirt. The only use for dirt is, I believe, creating trees. Also, composters cannot be selected. This is a bug.\n-   Mine - Identical to Dust Digger in everything except appearance and the fact that it produces stone instead of dust.\n-   Transmuter - Converts dust to metal. Metal is required to build and upgrade many different types of buildings, including houses, so these are very useful. Converts faster when upgraded. Also, at level 1 they do not pollute, but when they are upgraded they do.\nWhen a building is clicked on it will be selected. The menu on the left will now say the type of building, the upgrade level it's at, have a picture of the building, a button to upgrade it if it can be upgraded, and a button to sell it. When the upgrade button is hovered over, it will say the cost to upgrade, and when the sell button is hovered over, it will say the value it can be sold for.\nAt the bottom left of the screen there's a timer that says how long you have left to get the right amount of oxygen and to build and upgrade enough houses. If you finish early, you can click the \"I'm Done!\" button. When either the timer runs out or you click that button, it will tell you whether you won and why. You can keep playing after that. If you ever want to go back to the title screen, though, you can click the \"Title Menu\" button in the lower-right corner.\n\ntl;dr? Go away.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/8961dc2deffae4f094dc5c2056e7226f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=8883","author":{"name":"Pitzik4","uid":8883,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/34680578985fd9f802d0bf206f9d4d1c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/pitzik4/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8883-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8883-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Java","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9077764/earthEvacuation/ld23.jar"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9077764/earthEvacuation/source.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9077764/earthEvacuation/playLD.html"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://youtu.be/i21FgKHX7zk"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1120,"score":10}],"platforms":["java","web","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Flight of the Ladybug","category":"compo","description":"Click on the 'Web' link to play the game.

Oh well.\n\n\nStrategy Guide:\n---------------\nA few people have asked about strategy, here it is:\n\nYou start with 3 families, each with a brother and a sister.  They cannot mate with each other.  On the left are females, the right are the males.  PAY ATTENTION TO THE LAST NAMES,  the first one is the mother's last name and the last is the father's last name.\n\nIf you do not mix genes properly, bad things happen.\n\nDO NOT OVERWORK your people.  Their health will decline rapidly when they are tired.  \n\nThey best way to gain fitness is to chop wood.\n\nTo chop wood click on a villager, click on a nearby forest then click on the grass where you want him/her to pile the chopped logs.\n\nBetter fitness = Less health issues with ageing.\n\nBuild homes for your people so they can rest and breed.  They do not need to enter the house to rest, they just need to be near it (24 pixels).\n\nTo build a home,  select a person,  click on a pile of chopped wood, then select an empty location.\n\nTo upgrade/maintain a house,  do the same but select a dwelling already made.  \n\nDwellings will break apart over time so they must be maintained.\n\nWhen a new child is born, ONE parent may leave the house.  If you orphan a child they will die.\n\nNew children are very weak.  Let them rest a while then send them out to do work.  Keep them near-by homes and neighbours so they don't die of exhaustion.\n\nVillagers cannot be mothers or fathers until they are at least 10 years old.  The average life expectancy for perfectly fit people is about 35 years.\n\nThe optimal strategy is to build three houses and get your original families breeding and -if you are feeling ambitious - inter-breeding as quickly as possible so that you have a larger gene pool to work with in the future.  \n\nMake one villager chop wood then rest, chop wood, then rest.  Make another villager pick up wood and build/repair a shelter. This is the most efficient way to build and maintain shelter.  Do this once for each shelter and get the kids helping out too to increase their fitness.\n\nWhen a villager's health begins to decline with age (everyone dies eventually),  let them become parents,  or if they are really fit and good at chopping wood work them to death.\n\nP.s. yes the simulation is supposed to be 'slow'.  When you have a huge village trust me,  there is a lot to micro-manage.\n\nThat's all I can think of.\n\nGood luck!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c2b6f46ddb499d4b38df6c01ae68772b.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=8361","author":{"name":"Suese","uid":8361,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c175b14e958038673b2b97df96f64edf?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/suese/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8361-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8361-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://danmckinnon.net/tiny_world/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://danmckinnon.net/tiny_world/src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":74},{"area":"overall","rank":128,"score":3.54},{"area":"mood","rank":133,"score":3.27},{"area":"innovation","rank":160,"score":3.52},{"area":"audio","rank":191,"score":3.07},{"area":"humor","rank":222,"score":2.71},{"area":"theme","rank":255,"score":3.35},{"area":"graphics","rank":273,"score":3.24},{"area":"fun","rank":347,"score":2.98}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Tiny Defense","category":"compo","description":"It's rough, but functional.

I made this with Python, pyglet and pymunk, and all of the art is original.\n\n-----\n\nYou find yourself stuck on a tiny island, with nothing but strange, happy looking boxes to keep you company. But when a hoard of crazed, exploding[1] space bees appears, even that is on the line!\n\nFortunately, there happen to be some more benign, colourful boxes falling from the sky, and there's one thing the space bees didn't expect: you spent twenty years playing Tetris *for a reason*.\n\nGuide the falling blocks to protect your happy, green-coloured pals! Maybe the bees will get bored and go away, eventually.\n\nControls:\n - Left and Right arrow keys to guide the current block.\n - Down arrow to make the block fall (slightly) faster.\n - Space to release the block.\n - If you really don't want a block, just move it off the edge of the screen.\n\n[1] Actual, visible, gooey explosions were cut due to time constraints. They're just ideas of explosions now, so use your imagination.\n\n-----\n\nUnfortunately, one thing I didn't have time for (if you haven't noticed the performance) was testing / developing in Windows. The exe file should just work, but it seems Pyglet is a little less widely compatible than I was hoping. Leave a comment if it works. I'm interested to know. But if it's handy for you, there's a better chance of having fun with the Linux version :)\n\n-----\n\nIf you're curious for some reason, here's the stuff I had left to do that I would have liked to do:\n - Actually formidable space bees that fly properly (and aren't fighting with the physics engine).\n - Sound effects.\n - Explosion effects.\n - Cleverer falloff for explosions.\n - Block shattering effects.\n - Better performance. Right now it gets really slow once a few blocks have been created (about two minute's worth). This is mostly because I completely ignored memory management until the last minute.\n - Different types of attackers (things on foot, sticky bees, better flying bees, explodey ones that reliably shatter blocks).\n - An arrow at the edge of the screen pointing at incoming attack waves.\n - Special properties for different types of blocks.\n\nSo, yeah, look at that list and imagine the exciting game that isn't. Then enjoy this one! I'm happy with it, too.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/430d536b818d693d098e8f9c2c515903.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=10898","author":{"name":"Dylan McCall","uid":10898,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4ae854328bd0e941bb00d4a703f8941a?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/dylan-m/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10898-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10898-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10898-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10898-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10898-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/10898-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Linux","url":"http://www.dylanmccall.com/wp-content/uploads/SpaceBeesAttack-source.tar.gz"},{"label":"Windows (Maybe)","url":"http://www.dylanmccall.com/wp-content/uploads/SpaceBeesAttack-windows.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.dylanmccall.com/wp-content/uploads/SpaceBeesAttack-source.tar.gz"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":29,"score":3.7},{"area":"humor","rank":78,"score":2.78},{"area":"overall","rank":203,"score":2.5},{"area":"fun","rank":210,"score":2.1},{"area":"graphics","rank":221,"score":2.3},{"area":"theme","rank":255,"score":1.6},{"area":"coolness","rank":1007,"score":20}],"platforms":["linux","desktop","win"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Stellar Nurse","category":"jam","description":"Art by Arne ( androidarts.com ), Code by Blecki ( jemgine.omnisu.com ), and Music by BurnZeZ.\n\t\t\nYou are a stellar nurse, and, damn these meteors!

The sooner you let go of the space bar, the faster you'll throw it. So if you want to knock someone out of position, let go immediately. If you want a short-range throw for a defensive position, hold on for a second or two.\n\nOnce the brooms come out you can mash the space bar to reduce friction and keep the rock rolling. In short, sweep if you want to go faster.

If that doesn't work, you can do into the dist folder and run TinyBoxes.exe.\n\n32-bit isn't working right now, I'm working on it ASAP. Please come back to it later, you can bookmark it if you want. There are 3 weeks of judging. If you really want to play it, just install python and pygame in 32 bit, and run the tinyboxes.py, just like a Mac. -EDIT- 32 bit is being a real bugger. I'm very sorry. If you are reading the comments  and want to play it, an install of python and pygame is required. They're not bad things to have though. Just use the same instructions as for a Mac and it should work. Let me know if you try this and it doesn't.\n\nIf you have a mac, you can download the Windows distribution, and install python and pygame.

If you make a connection from one end of the level to another in a straight horizontal or vertical line, and step out of the way, the line of tiles will collapse, making the universe smaller, and tiles you stepped on will lose their charge. If you make a connection that doesn't reach all the way across, the tiles will be cleared between the two points, but the tiles you stepped on retain their charge. Confusing at the moment, I know, but try to enjoy the idea and the art, if nothing else :)\n\nSynopsis: What if you were a agorophobic nanobot stuck inside an experimental, infinitely repeating universe created by a mad scientist playing God?  Find out in Agorobophobia!  24(ish) (un)playable levels - unlimited possibilities!\n\nIn this puzzle game, the aim is to reach the end point of each level by destroying cells by placing a start and end point in the level.  Placing the end points at opposite sides of the grid cause the world to shrink!  Level 5 onwards are infinitely repeating, and can also be shrunk until you occupy the only grid space!  Is this world tiny, or infinitely huge?  We'll let you decide.\n\nUnfortunately we didn't get as far as we'd have liked to with this game concept, but nonetheless, we have a playable proof of concept demo that we think is actually a very interesting idea.  If you are interested in innovative ideas, and not too fussed about gameplay, this is the game for you!

Equipped with only a small light burst (to ward off evil), find as many cubes as you can!\n\nControls:\nArrows to move\nSpace to jump\nLeft Ctrl for light burst\n\n(NOTE: for Mac users, if you run into issues using the Ctrl key + arrow keys, you can alternately use A and D to move, Space to Jump, and Mouse for light burst)\n\n\nRunning into an evil cube will slightly diminish the intensity of your light burst, until you completely run out of light.  Collecting lost cubes will brighten your light burst.\n\n/* END ENTRY

Players are a \"NERD\", or NanoBot Emergency Repair Drone, and are tasked with navigating a system looking for a broken CPU Chip. The game randomly generates a system to explore and one of the dark grey \"Chips\" on your mini-map must be Repaired to restore it to working order. In your way are other NanoBots that have gone rogue due to the defective Chip. You can fight, stun or attempt to flee the squishy MiniBot, the imposing GorillaBot or the all-mighty TankBot. Players can heal their NERD by traveling on the circuit traces in the system. And if I get time, I'm going to add power ups when you visit the capacitors, LEDs and resistor boss fights as well. (We'll see if I can get to them...) The NanoBot sprites were all made using pictures of Lego bots my sons build.

At the highest level, having lots of captured pieces can slow down the AI a lot.\n\nSome info about minishogi and shogi on wikipedia:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minishogi\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi\n\nI have not used the Japanese characters to make the game more accessible. Instead I've used diagrams that show how the piece moves. I hope they are understandable.\n\n*UPDATE*\n\nMINI-HOW TO PLAY:\nSo this is basically a variant of chess. The goal is to capture the opponent's king. You have to actually take the king since I didn't implement checkmate.\n\nThe pieces are from left to right: King, Gold general, Silver general, Bishop and Rook. On the second row in front of the king there is a Pawn.\n\nRather than use the Japanese characters like normal shogi, I've made diagrams of how each piece moves. Normal line means one step in that direction, an arrow means as many steps as required.\n\nLike chess you capture by moving on the square occupied by an opponent's piece. You cannot jump over pieces. Unlike chess the pawn has no special capture move.\n\nIn shogi, captured pieces can be moved back into play on any empty square. This counts as your turn. The only restriction is that the pawn can't be dropped on the last row (since it couldn't move).\n\nPromotion: Most pieces (all except gold general and king) can be promoted if they move to, from or inside the promotion zone. In minishogi the promotion zone is the row furthest away from you (like in chess).\n\nPawn and Silver move like Gold when promoted.\nRook and Bishop gain an extra one step move in the directions they don't move normally.\n\nPromoting a piece is optional except for the pawn (since it would have no move left if left unpromoted). But most of the time it's a good idea to do it. Pieces always revert to their unpromoted state when captured.\n\nFor experienced shogi players: I didn't implement special rules to forbid two pawns on the same column and or giving checkmate with a dropped pawn, so you can use those should they happen in a game.

It's sort of therapeutic to watch the world come together. Hope you enjoy it!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/64c05f73f0ede7e03d26dbde4b52f76d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=8804","author":{"name":"Ishisoft","uid":8804,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d44896c06717f8533acaaecf4579d9e0?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/ishisoft/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8804-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8804-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8804-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8804-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8804-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/8804-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://ishisoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ishisoft_this_precious_land.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://ishisoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ishisoft_this_precious_land_source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":54},{"area":"graphics","rank":4,"score":4.51},{"area":"overall","rank":6,"score":4.26},{"area":"fun","rank":8,"score":4.04},{"area":"theme","rank":12,"score":4.29},{"area":"innovation","rank":28,"score":4.08},{"area":"mood","rank":55,"score":3.6},{"area":"audio","rank":305,"score":2.78},{"area":"humor","rank":566,"score":1.97}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Tiny Conflict","category":"compo","description":"You are a lonely bacterium, on a rock, in space.\nBut you feel like you aren't important.\n\nOnly a small part of the universe. \n\nBut you are going to change that.\nYou begin mitosis, and create an army of bacteria.\n\t\t\t\t\nThis is only the beginning.\n\nYou are going to conquer this Solar System!\t\n\nUse WASD to control your planet.\nHover over planets for more information.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/fe4973001661b0680e069d492cb68798.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=7800","author":{"name":"MillerMan","uid":7800,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8d862e6df463b1594a73b028cf157ac8?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/millerman/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7800-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7800-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7800-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7800-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7800-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7800-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7800-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/7800-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://games.redream.co.nz/conflict.php"},{"label":"Desktop","url":"http://games.redream.co.nz/ConflictDesktop.jar"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://games.redream.co.nz/TinyConflict_src.zip"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6Lo5_V1zCc"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":71},{"area":"theme","rank":43,"score":3.95},{"area":"fun","rank":63,"score":3.61},{"area":"overall","rank":68,"score":3.74},{"area":"innovation","rank":76,"score":3.79},{"area":"graphics","rank":128,"score":3.71},{"area":"mood","rank":174,"score":3.16},{"area":"humor","rank":326,"score":2.44},{"area":"audio","rank":404,"score":2.54}],"platforms":["web","java"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Tiny Resolution","category":"compo","description":"Tiny Resolution\n\nStory\n\nSomething  has gone horribly wrong and the world has lost its display Resolution.\nRestoring this tiny world is up to you.

Cheers!\n\n---\n\nThe biggest problem was that I didn't have the time to do any real playtesting, so there will definitely be bugs and balance problems, heh.\n\nAnyway, enough excuses. Let me explain the game.\n\n(mu)niverse is a very simplified version of a space exploration/trade/action game. It feels a bit like Elite but with top-down 2D of Star Control II, if you're familiar with either of those games. You select a star system, then a planet/moon, and there you can gather resources, visit space stations, pick up passengers, trade goods, and encounter simple enemies.\n\n---\n\nInstructions:\nStar Map:\n- Arrow Keys move cursor to select star system, highlighted with green circle.\n- Large turquoise circle is the range of your FTL fuel.\n- 'Z' selects star system\n- 'C' returns to Flight Mode\n\nPlanet Map:\n- Arrow Keys move cursor to select a planet you wish to visit.\n- 'Z' travels to that planet (instantaneously) and puts you in Flight Mode\n- 'C' returns to Star Map\n\nFlight Mode:\n- Arrow Keys -- control is much like classic Asteroids.\n  * Down is afterburner (\"brake\").\n- 'Z' fire cannon.\n- \"Park\" over a space station for a few seconds to enter the Station Screen\n- Blinking pixels on and around planets are resources -- fly into them to collect them.\n\nStation Screen:\n- 'C' to exit the Station.\n- Up/Down to select different items on current screen.\n- Left/Right change screen (Cargo[trade], Missions, Hangar)\n  * Cargo\n    - 'Z' - Buy selected good\n    - 'X' - Sell selected good\n  * Missions\n    - 'Z' - Accept/Abandon selected mission\n  * Hangar\n    - 'Z' - Purchase selected upgrade\n\n---\n\nSome stuff that I want to be able to happen in the final version:\n- More visual variety of planets, stations, enemies, etc.\n- More than Taxi missions.\n  * Research missions -- acquire and return goods from a remote planet.\n  * Transporting unruly prisoners...\n  * Bounty hunting.\n- FTFTL (faster than FTL) jumping to different sectors of the Galaxy (Galaxy Screen and Jump-gates).\n- Building a reputation against the police. :)\n- Hiring crewmembers\n  * Mechanic - Automatically repairs your ship mid-flight if you have scrap metal.\n  * Smuggler - Reduces your chance of being caught with fugitive passengers or illegal goods.\n  * Muscle - Keeps unruly passengers in order.\n- Jettisoning anything and everything, including passengers and bombs...\n\n\nFull disclosure: yes, I have fixed a handful of bugs -- mostly crash-bugs -- post-jam. Anything major added feature-wise will be on the \"Post-Jam Online\" version. I intend to continue working on this game so let me know if you have any ideas!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d9fde0f5dba76a297f3638d4b2662edd.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=12236","author":{"name":"namuol","uid":12236,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4ff020826d61a6cfd875cb5cc29e5ce6?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/namuol/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12236-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12236-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12236-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12236-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12236-shot2.gif-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12236-shot2.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12236-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12236-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12236-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/123793/12236-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://namuol.github.com/tinyverse"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://github.com/namuol/tinyverse"},{"label":"Web (post-jam)","url":"http://namuol.github.com/muniverse"},{"label":"Source (post-jam)","url":"http://github.com/namuol/muniverse"},{"label":"Devlog","url":"http://muniverse-game.tumblr.com/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":89},{"area":"overall","rank":58,"score":3.5},{"area":"fun","rank":69,"score":3.13},{"area":"mood","rank":91,"score":3.05},{"area":"innovation","rank":92,"score":3.19},{"area":"graphics","rank":144,"score":3.08},{"area":"humor","rank":181,"score":1.9},{"area":"theme","rank":187,"score":2.54},{"area":"audio","rank":197,"score":1.56}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":23,"title":"Pixels World","category":"compo","description":"Pixel is a young rebellious Pixlanier.

Sometimes they will help you - make you faster, let you jump higher, or you will even find a jetpack - some of them make you slower.\n\nThe levels are interrupted by story sequences with GiDOS talking to you.
