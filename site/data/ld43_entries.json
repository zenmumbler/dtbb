They help you transcode your consciousness. Without them, you'll never make it!\n* If you must, sacrifice them to assimilate (gain health) or to self-destruct, clearing wreckage blocking the field along with your foes. Be careful though, detonations that powerful can destroy potential allies!\n\n### Controls:\n* WASD style movement. Arrow keys work too.\n* Q or Middle-mouse-button: (HEAL) Sacrifices a minion to heal you by assimilating with you.\n* Right-Click: (SELF-DESTRUCT) Sends a minion to mouse location to detonate. This kills all enemies and clears pre-existing debris.\n\n![Screenshot1.png](///raw/515/d/z/1f56e.png)\n\nMeet Paladin, the last surviving human brain on Terra. Your mission has been compromised and the forces of the Veil are converging on your position. In a last ditch effort to escape with the vital information you have secured, you are attempting to uploading your consciousness off world. However, the transcoding process is lengthy with your calculations alone.\n\nFortunately, you have discovered a flaw in the coding of a small number of enemy bots, allowing you to wrest control and focus their computation power on your transcoder. Be careful though, for your enemies are overwhelming and some of these Buddy Bots may need to be sacrificed to repair your exosuit or to rain fire on your enemies. Can you hold off long enough to complete the upload, or will humanity lose their last glimmer of hope?\n\nSacrifices must be made!\n\n![Screenshot2.png](///raw/515/d/z/1f56f.png)\n\n![Screenshot3.png](///raw/515/d/z/1f570.png)\n\nThis is elitegoliath's 4th with Drekler's 4th jam together, EquisStenchman 3rd jam, and Squiglypig's first. It \nwas a wild ride with lots of excitement, frustration, and caffeine. Overall, it went pretty smoothly for our second game in Unity and it was much more ambitious than the last. We learned a ton about Unity, C#, scope creep, and teamwork. We look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback and seeing if you can blast your way to victory!\n\n\n\n## Patches\n### Dec. 6\n* Fixed issue where game wouldn't start.\n* Added MAC build.\n\n### Dec. 7\n* Throttled graphics so the game was less prone to crashing.\n* Fixed AI breaking sometimes at random.\n* Fixed some issues with massive overhead when bots deploy from APCs.\n* Fixed broken spawn rates of enemies.\n* Fixed broken sound files.\n* Fixed broken death condition.\n* Lowered music volume so SFX could be heard.\n* Fixed issue with colliders on obstacles not working on lasers properly.\n* Added LINUX build.\n\n### Dec. 8\n* More performance enhancements by replacing some of the \"invoke\" methods with coroutines.\n* Balanced spawn rates.\n* Added custom cursor to make it easier to see.\n* Added menu allowing player to restart or exit the game at will (use esc).\n* Improved the \"Detonate Companion\" feature to make it more useful.\n* Added more descriptive instructions in the \"Main Menu.\"\n* Added story elements to credit scene.\n* Made depleted \"Power Core\" health indicators to make them easier to notice.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//515/d/z/1f3bf.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/last-key-of-robotica-3","author":{"name":"elitegoliath","uid":54491,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//bd4/d/z/d2c8.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/elitegoliath"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//515/d/z/1f56e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//515/d/z/1f56e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//515/d/z/1f56f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//515/d/z/1f56f.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//515/d/z/1f570.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//515/d/z/1f570.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://arsenallagspike.itch.io/last-key-of-robotica-3"},{"label":"HTML5

To survive we left our village and are now travelling towards the coast and its harbours to leave this cursed country.\"\n\nBlood Trail is a game about a small band of five medieval refugees who try to reach a harbour.\n\nThe game is made of two parts: a map view, where you can command your group across a procedurally generated world with forests, cities and plains and random encounters: while travelling through the lands, you will randomly encounter friendly or evil people, with whom you can communicate or fight.\n\nThe game idea was way too big for one weekend, as usual, so expect a bumpy experience at best. We didn't manage to implement things like an inventory system or the plague you are fleeing from, but hopefully the game is interactive enough to be some fun and get some ratings at least.\n\n\n* Controls:\n * On Mapview:\n   * Left Mousebutton - Move your Group (Blue Dot)\n   * WASD/Middle Mousebutton/Right Mousebutton - Scroll Map\n   * Mousewheel - Zoom Map\n * During Encounter:\n   * Click enemies to select them\n   * Click the swords to attack the selected enemy\n   * Click the shield to enter defensive stance to receive damage reduction\n\n\n* @Rhiannon - Artwork (3D Models, Icons, Dialogues)\n* @Alfadas - Programming (Encounters and Combat System)\n* @413x - Programming (Procedural Map Generation)\n* @kruemelkeksfan - Programming (Character Management and Map Movement)\n\n\n![bloodtrail1.png](///raw/250/3/z/1e879.png)\n![bloodtrail2.png](///raw/250/3/z/1e87b.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//250/3/z/1e877.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/blood-trail","author":{"name":"kruemelkeksfan","uid":12370,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/kruemelkeksfan"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//250/3/z/1e879.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//250/3/z/1e879.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//250/3/z/1e87b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//250/3/z/1e87b.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/Alfadas/pLD3011_2120/raw/master/Releases/BloodTrail_Win_v0_1_1.zip"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://github.com/Alfadas/pLD3011_2120/raw/master/Releases/BloodTrail_Mac_v0_1_1.app.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://github.com/Alfadas/pLD3011_2120/raw/master/Releases/BloodTrail_Linux_v0_1_1.zip"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/Alfadas/pLD3011_2120"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Poor Thief","category":"jam","description":"","thumbnail_url":"","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/poor-thief","author":{"name":"beepyeah","uid":59772,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c79/e/z/d9c0.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/beepyeah"},"screens":[],"links":[],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Morgue Bot","category":"jam","description":"This is a bite-sized snack of a game.

Before you actually begin playing through the level, you will have to breed the creatures at your disposal to create one suitable for overcoming the challenges you will face. You will go through 4 rounds of breeding. At the start of each breeding cycle you will be asked to cull the herd, sacrificing 6 creatures who you do not wish to breed. Afterwards, based on the remaining creatures’ attributes, 6 new creatures will be spawned. After repeated generations of breeding, you will be left with a final crop of creatures, and a random creature from it will be chosen to be your avatar for the level. You can hover your mouse over any creature to see its attributes, all ranging from level 1-5.  The attributes will affect both its appearance and its performance in certain tasks, so breed wisely. If an obstacle seems impassable, try restarting and breeding a new creature perhaps more up to the task!\n\nFurther controls for the game are as follows:\n\nWhile in the Cull the Herd Stage:\n\n![breed1.PNG](///raw/336/e1/z/1e7f4.png)\n\nTo move camera during cull the herd stage use w, a, s, d\nClick on the members of the herd you don't want to breed with your mouse\nPress G to skip this stage and have a completely randomly generated member of the herd\n\nWhile in the survival stage\n\n![fireAndWaterlevels.PNG](///raw/336/e1/z/1e7f7.png)\n\nTo move avatar in game use w, a, s, d\npress L to go back to the breeding stage\nDepending on your avatar's strength you may be able to push blocks\nDepending on your avatar's swim you may be able to swim up a waterfall\nDepending on your avatar's health you can handle more attacks \nDepending on your avatar's jump you may have access to more routes\nSpeed is self explanatory :-)\nBe careful as fire and spikes hurt you and eventually kill you.\n\n![breed2.PNG](///raw/336/e1/z/1e7f5.png)\n\n![firelevel.PNG](///raw/336/e1/z/1e7f8.png)\n\n![windmill level.PNG](///raw/336/e1/z/1e7f9.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//336/e1/z/1e7ee.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/cull-the-herd","author":{"name":"Ninnec","uid":124467,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/ninnec"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//336/e1/z/1e7f4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//336/e1/z/1e7f4.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//336/e1/z/1e7f7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//336/e1/z/1e7f7.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//336/e1/z/1e7f5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//336/e1/z/1e7f5.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//336/e1/z/1e7f8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//336/e1/z/1e7f8.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//336/e1/z/1e7f9.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//336/e1/z/1e7f9.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://breeder.itch.io/cull-the-herd"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"An Fhicheall Mhór (Grand Chess)","category":"jam","description":"This is Grand Chess—an RPG-meets-chess that will push you to your limits.

one person will need to be _sacrificed_.  \nIn the final version children will reward with more points than the player when saved.\n\nTo command the monster children, click the left/right arrow buttons at the bottom of the window.  \nThe target child will then move to that direction until they hit a wall, at which point they can accept new input.  \nWhen a child is moving, they cannot be commanded.\n\nThe released jam-version is more of a prototype, as it isn't really a game in its state.  \nWe will (hopefully) be releasing a playable post-jam version with multiple levels this coming weekend.\n\n## Controls\n| Action           | Input(s)                          |\n| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |\n| Player Movement  | A, D                              |\n| Player Jump      | Space                             |\n| Minion Movement  | Mouse click on arrow buttons      |\n| Camera Movement  | Arrow keys                        |\n| Quit             | Escape                            |\n\n---\n\n## Concept\nMost of what is listed in this \"__Concept__\" section is not implemented in the jam-version of the game.  \nThese were our main ideas, which we are working on implementing for a post-jam version.\n\nThe game should be a __puzzle__ game, in which you dictate your children (weird monster children) what to do.  \nYou could tell them to move right and fall into a gap from which they can not escape;  \nyou (and your other children) would then be able to walk on top of the sacrificed child to cross the gap.  \nThe goal would be to get to some food at the end of the level (hence the name).\n\nSome children would have different abilities:  \none would be able to jump (_Long Leg Larry_, the one with the long legs);  \none would be able to fall through _one-way platforms*_ (_Bloat_, the fat one);  \nthe last one would not be able to do anything special, but would reward with extra points when saved (_The Thing_).\n\nEvery saved person (player and children) would give points when saved, some more than others:  \nthe player would reward the least amount of points, as they have the most freedom of movement;  \nthe children would reward more points, the one without an ability rewarding the most.\n\nWe planned the setting to be post-apocalyptic and the goal would be to gather food by beating levels.  \nWe wanted to implement some minor story/lore which would unfold via a conversation/monologue-system,  \nexplaining/hinting at the situation (who are these _monster children_ and why are they following this ominous-looking dude?).\n\n__*one-way platforms__:  \nA person (player or child) can jump through these platforms from below, but cannot fall through them from above.  \nThey are implemented and exist in the jam-version, but they are invisible / have no texture(s).\n\n## Missing Features\n- __A goal__  \n  Each level should have a _goal_;  \n  an area where you would bring as many persons as possible to gain as many points as possible  \n  and to move on to the next level.  \n- __Level Manager / Level Selection__  \n  Obviously, there should be more than one level in the final product.  \n  After you beat one level, you would move on to the next one.  \n  Additionally, a __level selection__ menu would be nice.\n- __Audio Manager__  \n  The jam-version only loops a single song, which is sad because  \n  our sound artist (@williwiderstand) has created __5 songs__ in total.  \n  You can still check them all out in the `resources/audio` directory if you downloaded the zip file.\n- __Sound Effects__\n- __Background Image(s)__  \n  @hoichael has created a temporary background image, but I was not able to implement it in time.  \n  The final game should definitely have some background images, which may change per level.\n- __Background Decorations__  \n  @williwiderstand has created a neat, animated eye that was planned to be put in the background as decoration.\n- __Child abilities__  \n  As mentioned above, children were planned to have special abilities.\n- __Pivoter__  \n  An \"Interactable\" object, which when touched by a child will invert their direction of movement.\n- __Conversation/Monologue system__  \n  A system to convey or hint at some lore regarding the monster children and the setting of the game.\n- __Text Popups__  \n  Text that will pop-up above a child when they are commanded to move.  \n- __Level Reset__ button\n- __Pause__  \n  Being able to pause the running game would be nice and shouldn't be too hard to implement.  \n  (Although probably unnecessary)\n- __MacOS Version__  \n  A MacOS version shouldn't be difficult to build and distribute (I think), I just need access to an updated mac.\n\n---\n\n## Programs Used\n|                  |                                   |\n| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |\n| Language         | __Rust__                          |\n| Engine           | [__ggez__][ggez]                  |\n| Framework        | [__noframe__][noframe]            |\n| Graphics         | __Gimp__                          |\n| Audio            | [__BoscaCeoil__][boscaceoil]      |\n| Editor           | __vim__                           |\n\n## Credits\n|                  |                                   |\n| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |\n| @hoichael        | Concept, Design, Graphics         |\n| @williwiderstand | Audio, Graphics                   |\n| @noahro          | Programming                       |\n\n---\n\nThank you for your time!  \nAlthough we weren't able to release a proper game, we still had a ton of fun and learned a lot during this jam.  \nThis was my first proper Rust project and I am very happy about how I managed to go at it.  \nIn case anybody is interested in the code, it is available on [github][source].  \nThe framework I wrote for the game is also available on [github][noframe].  \nIt doesn't have many features, but it did help provide base code, which I would have had to write during the jam.\n\n[ggez]:       https://ggez.rs\n[boscaceoil]: https://boscaceoil.net\n[noframe]:    https://github.com/Noah2610/noframe\n[source]:     https://github.com/Noah2610/LD43","thumbnail_url":"","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/nihilistic-nurture-navigation","author":{"name":"NoahRo","uid":56337,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//11c/d/z/15451.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/noahro"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://github.com/Noah2610/LD43"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=13qT0dD2fZf7KK0lasv2xtmkup8CWfaBr"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=19yjSOizzS06dnpwwkOvzevypQkqzvmUS"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["linux","desktop","win"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Halls of Atonement","category":"jam","description":"A rougelike where each time you clear the level, you're forced to make a choice.

First one was more than a year ago, And I have to admit, I've learned a lot since then :) Our first LD game did quite good, but our experience was rather stressful, and the game was kinda dark and heavy.\n\nThis time we wanted the opposite. Stress-free experience and short, funny, 2d game about something close to our heart. No stress, just fun, if we won't finish, that's A-OK~!\n\nOur team is Polish/Ukrainian, That's why we chose slav culture as main topic of the game.\n\nMain character, Gopnik, is spending his free time chilling on the bench. Suddenly, a wild Pigeon King arrives, demanding a tribute! Problem is, we don't have anything to give...

Then  Grzesiek, our animator,  created  walk in unity. In \"fight mode\" each character has 3 faces: Base, Sad and Angry. My main goal during character creation was to make them look shitty :D Since I'm not able to do everything, Nensi took care of some additional graphics, bless her!\n\nAnother extremely important part of the game was music, which was created by ЯЩЕР (who also created well detailed BG for the scene). Fun part about music in our game, is you can actually change the songs during the gameplay.\n\nNikita, Grzesiek, Nikolay and Misha did scripting and all that tech things. I know shit about programming except some HTML stuff from my school times...soooo...you know.\n\nGuys I'm so sleepy, they order me to write this, But I want to go to sleep :D\nBUT\nOur game is not finished hahahah, But you know what? WHATEVER, hope you like it anyway!\nWe'll finish this in the future for sure, so stay tuned for all the updates!\n\nGood night!\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//fb1/e/z/1e540.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/gopnix","author":{"name":"nahual","uid":57791,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//fb1/e/z/e6c2.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/nahual"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e53/01/z/1ecdf.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e53/01/z/1ecdf.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e53/01/z/1ece0.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e53/01/z/1ece0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e53/01/z/1ece1.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e53/01/z/1ece1.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://bondar.itch.io/gopnix"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Ritual Slaughter","category":"jam","description":"**Ritual Slaughter!**\n\n![Ritual_Slaughter_Cover_Art.png](///raw/5a4/2/z/1e6e1.png)\n\nIn this game, Lucifer is trying to destroy the world, and the worlds only hope is you- or are you in it for just the power gained?

You are a blood god, with the goal of returning to the mortal plane. In order to do this, you must sacrifice a virgin at your altar. You can bring them to life, but the altar is four rooms away.\n\n\n![abgvv4.PNG](///raw/764/2/z/1e562.png)\n\n\n## Mechanics\n\nThe game is played in three rotating phases:\n\n1. Spawn -- you must create a new virginal Loved One in the the Blood God's Chamber at the beginning of every turn. This costs 1 Soul, and if you enter the Spawn phase with 0 Soul you will lose.\n\n2. Encounter -- when you have rooms with at least three Loved Ones, a random encounter will occur. This only happens in rooms that have at least three Loved Ones. You will be forced to make a choice: you can make the Loved Ones fight to the death and preserve their virgin status with the winner gaining Strength, or they can kiss and lose their virgin status (but both will gain a Strength point).\n\n3. Act -- by selecting a room using the arrows in the bottom left, you may choose a single action per turn:\n\n    Rest: yield your action, with no effect to Soul or Loved Ones\n\n   ​Advance: choose a Loved One to move to the front of the line in a particular room\n\n   ​Open Door: the Loved One at the front of the line will hold the door open, allowing those behind to move to the next room. The number of Loved Ones that move is determined by the Strength of the Loved One holding the door (e.g. 2 STR allows 2 Loved Ones to advance). The door holder will then be crushed by the door.\n\n   ​Touch the Idol: the Loved One at the front of the line can touch the Idols in the Corridor of Hope and the Corridor of Despair. This allows you to consume them for an increase in Soul:\n\n      ​​Weakling non-virgins (STR: 0): 0 Soul\n\n      ​​Weak non-virgins (STR: 1): 2 Soul\n\n      ​​Strong non-virgins (STR: > 1): 4 Soul\n\n      ​​Virgins: 6 + STR Soul\n\nYour goal is to pass a virgin through the final door, beyond the Entry to the Altar room. Good luck!\n\n\n## Credit\n\nDesigned and created by Zak Reynolds and Clint Glenn\n\nGraphical and musical assets are original, created with the help of Pickle Editor, FL Studio, Serum, and Audacity. Sound effects were created with help from resources in the GDC audio pack, Image-Line samples, and freesound.org.\n\nFont: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/almendra​\n\nBuilt with Unity.\n\n\n## Philosophy\n\nWe wanted to create a game that involved sacrifice at every level. The easy choice for a setting (a blood god using sacrifices to take over the world) eventually resulted in what we thought were some interesting mechanics. Playing this game, you lose something at just about every turn -- some Soul at the beginning, either a Loved One or someone's virginity at the Encounter phase, and you often trade a Loved One for advancement in the Act phase. It leads you to a lot of calculated risk decisions, and you're hopefully often left feeling like you've lost something-- making the joy you feel (when RNGesus rewards your risk-taking) that much better.\n\nThe names of the Loved Ones were intended to be provided by the player for an extra layer of sadism, but we unfortunately (or fortunately?) did not have the time to implement that feature. Instead, there are some random names, but hopefully the relationship 'modifiers' will still lead to some drama and fun when it comes to deciding whether to make the Loved Ones kill or \"kiss\" each other.\n\nWe also focused on the gameplay tuning and design prior to anything else -- at the end of Friday night we had nothing but notes, and there weren't any graphics in the unity project until halfway through Sunday! There are some visual bugs and not a lot of polish as a result, but we hope that you can enjoy the game for its gameplay.\n\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![abgvv2.PNG](///raw/764/2/z/1e55d.png)\n\n![abgvv3.PNG](///raw/764/2/z/1e55f.png)\n\n![abgvv5.PNG](///raw/764/2/z/1e567.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//764/2/z/1e545.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/a-blood-gods-virgin-voyage","author":{"name":"drprettypatty","uid":9319,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//764/2/z/11259.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/drprettypatty"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//764/2/z/1e562.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//764/2/z/1e562.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//764/2/z/1e55d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//764/2/z/1e55d.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//764/2/z/1e55f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//764/2/z/1e55f.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//764/2/z/1e567.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//764/2/z/1e567.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://github.com/zak-reynolds/LD43/tree/final"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://zre.itch.io/a-blood-gods-virgin-voyage"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Demon Queen's Possessions","category":"jam","description":"## The Demon queen wants to take over the world!\n\nHer power: **Possession**.

In the game, you are trying to trip switches that are hidden around the map. Once all of them are tripped, the portal to the next level is opened. However, there are enemies who have other ideas. Use the power-ups scattered around the map and advancing to the next level to gain levels and become stronger. However, the enemies become stronger too. See how far you can get before you die!\n\n**How did we apply the theme?** All bullets shot will bounce off the walls a couple of times, so you have to make sure that your aim is good. Therefore, shooting a bullet has the potential to be a sacrifice (of your health). Also, all power-ups scattered around the map have both positive and negative attributes, so you have to make a choice and see if that power-up is worth its trade-offs. (Also, we sacrificed all the graphics our graphics guy made because of reasons (sorry David))\n\n### Guide\n\n![2018-12-03 22_29_44-Window.png](///raw/b61/c/z/1e749.png)\n\nThis is you, the player. The green shows you the front of your character, or where you will shoot from. Use **WASD** to move and **Left-Click** to shoot. Use the mouse to aim.\n\n![2018-12-03 22_31_53-Window.png](///raw/b61/c/z/1e74a.png)\n\nThis is an enemy. They aren't your friend. They will always move towards you and periodically shoot bullets at you. So try to kill them with your bullets.\n\nAround the room, there will be 4 black boxes right on the edge of the screen. These are hallways to adjacent rooms. Moving onto them transitions you to the next room.\n\n![2018-12-03 22_49_29-Window.png](///raw/b61/c/z/1e74c.png)\n\nHowever, these black boxes that are in the middle of the rooms are the switches! Run into it to turn it green, meaning you have tripped it. The number of remaining switches is on your HUD\n\n![2018-12-03 22_55_53-Window.png](///raw/b61/c/z/1e756.png)\n\nAny other randomly colored boxes are Power-ups! The color shows the level of powerup (gray, light-green, blue, purple). Run up to it to see what it would do to your player. If you want the powerup, simply press **Space** and you will obtain the powerup.\n\n![2018-12-03 23_05_49-Window.png](///raw/b61/c/z/1e77f.png)\n\nWhen you trip all the switches, the big red box in the starting room turns green. This is your portal to the next level. Running up to it will advance the level. When you do, you will get 3 HP and +1 to a random stat. However, all the enemies stats raise too. So watch out!\n\nThe game goes on forever! See how far you can get!\n\n![Untitled.png](///raw/b61/c/z/1e311.png)\n\n**Box Explorer requires Java 8 or later.** If you use OpenJDK, make sure you also have OpenJFX installed.\n\nThis is our second ever Ludum Dare game. We were able to use a lot of the knowledge we acquired from the last one (along with some of the code) in order to help us make a better game. While the graphics probably don't look as good as our last game, we feel like the game overall is better (from a code standpoint at least). Hopefully this trend continues and whenever you see us next, it'll be an even better game.\n\nWhile we could've used things like Unity or GameMaker to help speed along the process of making the game, 75% of our team are current Computer Science students who enjoy the grind of problem-solving and writing a lot of code. At the end of the day, we care more about the experience of working on a big-ish project than how amazing the game plays out. So, at the end of the day, we are happy with the outcome. And we're sharing it with you in case you want to try it out. Treat it like a Proof of Concept game. Because that's basically what it is.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n### Credits\n* Parker: Development\n* Trevor: Development and Math\n* Jack: Development and Static\n* David: Graphics that we didn't end up using (sorry) and Audio\n\n### We have published a version that contains code written after the Jam ended.

After some hours of sleep, these issues have been resolved and you can now play Screw Them with all the MOOs you need.\n\nSound Version: https://rac-games.itch.io/screw-them-version-with-sounds\n\nScrew them is a \"Hack an Slay game where you play a robot who´s planet is invaded by evil cows. \n\nThis team is an open university gamejam group. Nobody in the team is a fullfletched developer, artist or anything relevant to game design. This year we had a lot of new interested students in our team. They started programming in this gamejam and learned alot.\n  \n\nCOMMENT BY THE DEVELOPERS:\n\nBecause of our time limit and some problems, we didn’t manage to create a Storyline. There are two Redeyebulls in the west and in the north- east and in the south are Cow-Hydras. You have to kill all the cows to save your planet. To get bigger and Stronger u have to disassemble your friends.\nThe textures of our game are all self-drawn, apart from the ground textures. \n \n\nCONTROLS:\n\nleft mouse:                klick to move\n\nright mouse:               whirlwind attack\n\nShift + left mous:         straight shoot\n\nE:                         disassemble your friends \n\n\nHOW IT WENT:\n\nOur final idea was a hack and slay game. Fastly we drifted in to a crazy and funny game where cows with lightsabers want to kill you and control your planet. All in all it was a smoth proces but in the end we focused on not so necessary parts of the game. We had a lot of Soundtracks and three fully animated Bosses. When the time run out we had a problem with the NavMesh. So we had to cut some parts out of the game. \n\n\n![intro.gif.gif](///raw/dd5/2/z/1e73d.gif)\n![disabel1.gif](///raw/dd5/2/z/1ebe1.gif)\n![gameplay1.gif](///raw/dd5/2/z/1ebe2.gif)\n\n\nHave fun!

It took me a while but once I understood the issue it was easy to fix. Both the WebGL and the PC version have been updated to use the smaller scaled images to reduce the memory they use and avoid memory allocation and crashing bugs.\n\n## ***Known issues**\nAlso, I did not spend too much time balancing the game an there is a possibility that if you are clicking too fast and you die, you may hit the restart button by mistake. I'm sorry about that but the game is short :)\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\nThough this is not my first game jam, it was the first time I competed semi-alone and had to wear multiple hats as designer and programmer working with genres I'm not too familiar with.\n\nThe experience was fun and I learned a lot about design and I feel like I leveled up in my Unity programming which is always a plus! :)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a67/8/z/1f425.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/forgeknight","author":{"name":"ProdigalSon","uid":34666,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a67/8/z/15330.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/prodigalson"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a67/8/z/1e660.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a67/8/z/1e660.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a67/8/z/1f2f5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a67/8/z/1f2f5.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a67/8/z/1f2f6.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a67/8/z/1f2f6.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a67/8/z/1f2f7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a67/8/z/1f2f7.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://prodigalson.itch.io/frogeknight"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://prodigalson.itch.io/frogeknight"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/nlaracuente/ForgeKnight"},{"label":"Other","url":""}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Together We Clear","category":"jam","description":"One adventurer is no match for the dungeon.

Click and drag up to three cards each turn to the pentagram to play them. You lose 1 Food plus 1 Food per Prisoner each turn, so make sure to stock up. You lose when you run out of Food. When you gather enough resources, you can summon demons by offering the supple bodies of your prisoners as tribute. Collect powerful cards from the demons as you work your way up the demonic food chain, from lesser to greater to Satan herself. \n\n**Content Warning**\n\nThis is a game about a cult that takes prisoners and sacrifices them to demons. Do not base your real life relationships on a video game sex cult. \n\n**Screenshots**\n\n![Screenshot (25).png](///raw/12b/e/z/1e9cb.png)\n\n![Screenshot (26).png](///raw/12b/e/z/1e9cc.png)\n\n![Screenshot (28).png](///raw/12b/e/z/1e9d3.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//12b/e/z/1e80c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/horny-demons","author":{"name":"Team Infernus","uid":60193,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//12b/e/z/dc7b.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/team-infernus"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//12b/e/z/1e9cb.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//12b/e/z/1e9cb.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//12b/e/z/1e9cc.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//12b/e/z/1e9cc.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//12b/e/z/1e9d3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//12b/e/z/1e9d3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://team-infernus.itch.io/horny-demons"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://team-infernus.itch.io/horny-demons"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://team-infernus.itch.io/horny-demons"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Sheepy","category":"jam","description":"Lore: \nThe shepherd has broken his leg on a rock out on his days work his sheep will sacrifice themselves to help him get home, Guide the sheep into the holes to allow the shepherd who cant jump because of his injury to pass over.     \n                                                                                                                                  \nFeatures:                                                                                                                     \n                                                                                                                          \nDone:                                                                                                                              \nSheep Physics- Picking Up And Dropping,                                                                                       \nshepherd Player - Movement and Camera,                                                                                        \nLevels 1-4,                                                                                                                     \nBasic Audio,                                                                                                                  \nGraphics,                                                                                                                      \nMenu,                                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                                                   \nUnDone:                                                                                                                        \nSheep Free Movement - (Sheep wander and follow you),                                                                         \nMore and Original Audio,                                                                                                      \nMore Levels,                                                                                                                  \nMore Uses for the Sheep - (Other than just filling in holes,                                                                      \nBug Fixing/Testing,                                                                                                                \nPolish - (Ran out of time for this so a lot of unused assets etc are still in the files),                                        \n                                                                                                                             \nDescription:                                                                                                                  \nSheepy is a fun, hypercasual game in which the shepherd must drag and place his sheep into holes to fill them in                order to reach the flag.

Everyone liked you. The elegant prince who excelled at swordsmanship and magic. Little did they know that you had an affinity for dark magic at birth. Curious as you've always been, you delved deeper into the source of your Dark Power in search for the origin. It made you stronger and you learned of powers of which only a necromancer could dream of, yet unlike most users of dark magic, you had no intention of using your power for evil purposes.\n\nThat is until the king went on a hunting trip. Bandits swarmed the royal hunting party, yet they were overwhelmed by the sheer amount of hostiles. You, as the prince, tried your best to save your father and brother, alas your normal powers were not up to the task. As you unlocked the powers of dark magic within, the bandits got obliterated seconds thereafter. Stunned by the whole ordeal the people who saw the outburst of violent magic did not know how to react and as soon as the hunting party returned to the capital rumors began to spread. Within a day you got put on a trial for dabbling in dark magic. Even your family did not know how to react as practicing dark magic is one of the most frowned upon acts one can commit. You were soon to be exiled. Banned from your own home and country. Mad, confused and spiteful you begin your new quest for survival.\n\nWhy did it have to be this way, you only tried to save what was dear to you. Why does it matter that you used dark magic when you used it for a purpose that is good and clear?\n\nAfter years of hardships, training and searching for an answer, you came to the conclusion that the root cause of this problem is the Kingdom itself. The people, the ruling class, everyone... is responsible for this outcome. You paid them with your loyalty, now it is time for them to pay you back. \n\n## Controls\n- **Arrow Keys** | Walk & Jump\n- **Z** | Attack (can combo three times for more damage and knockback)\n- **X** | Sacrifice a minion for health\n- **ESC/P** | (Un)Pause the game\n\n- You win when all of the enemies are killed.\n- You lose when your character dies.\n\n## Features\n- 2D Platforming\n- Hack'n'slash action\n- Sacrifice your kingdom's population to fuel your army\n- Sacrifice your army to fuel yourself\n- An army of minions\n\n## About the Jam\nSolo Entry... \nThis LD was a lot of fun for me as I had a (personally) good concept to start with... YET I threw my first idea away completely after 20 hours of work. So I started over and created this game. I feel proud of this game, art-wise especially, even though it is clunky at times and really short... sorry for that. The concept was way too big though, but I think I managed to get the most important features for it to be playable in, I guess.\nHave fun playing it and I'm looking forward to feedback :) \n\n## The Future\nI really liked working on this project and therefore I will keep on working on this project after Ludum Dare. It will gain a lot more features than it has. Most of them are already in a rough testing phase.\n- More and varied enemies.\n  - Archers, Pike-men, Knight (mounted and unmounted), different types of villagers, priests who resurrect the dead back to life, and so on.\n- Boss Battles\n  - Show the mighty figureheads of the Kingdom that throne is yours alone. Fight against fierce bosses and maybe even your own family.\n- Upgrades\n  - Your army might need to become a little stronger before you march on the Kingdom's Citadel. Upgrade their armor, weapons, skills and mutate them. \n  - Upgrade your character and gain more skills while upgrading existing ones.\n- Different landscapes\n- The Complete Story (as it has been written, but I had no time or space to implement all of it yet)\n- Better Combat\n  - I mean, it is kinda clunky at times, so it could use an upgrade.\n- AI Commands\n  - Make sure that your army is doing what it needs to do \n- **And anything else you guys, the players, want to see in the game\n\n## Media\n![Tutorial 1.png](///raw/973/6/z/1e661.png)\n**more to come soon, need some sleep first**\n\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//973/6/z/1f2ab.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/the-fallen-prince","author":{"name":"TwinGhosts","uid":25465,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//973/6/z/1b0c8.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/twinghosts"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//973/6/z/1e57f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//973/6/z/1e57f.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//973/6/z/1e661.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//973/6/z/1e661.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://twinghosts.itch.io/the-fallen-prince"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://twinghosts.itch.io/the-fallen-prince"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Feed the Gods","category":"jam","description":"...with your children\n\n![homescreen01 512.png](///raw/6c8/z/1e630.png)\n\n![screen_mojo 04.JPG](///raw/6c8/z/1e6c2.jpg)\n\n![image(1).png](///raw/6c8/z/1e62b.png)\n\nThe gods have watched the progress of your village with a benevolent eye... so far.\n\n![screen_mojo 01.JPG](///raw/6c8/z/1e3bb.jpg)\n\n![screen_mojo 05.JPG](///raw/6c8/z/1e6c3.jpg)\n\n![image(3).png](///raw/6c8/z/1e62d.png)\n\nIf you wish to stay in their good graces, A SACRIFICE MUST BE MADE !Arrows or WASD to move your point of view.

One day a metheoride crushed the ground, and cursed all Marziphonians. Because of the curse, their nightmares became portals for magical creatures, ”Magicis Cadem” they called it. Magical Massacres.\nA Hundered years later, another event occured in Marziphon. A Mage called “Onnm” found a way to unlift this curse. The solution was a spell which he called “banisment of nightmares”, with the spell, nobody would ever see any nightmares, but there was a problem, most needed ingredeent for the spell was human blood. He  gathered as many villagers as he can and found the city of Intyham, with it, Onnm can gather blood and sacrifice some for all. After he casted the spell, Marziphon’s ground shattered and formed lots of rifts which are full of deamonic powers. He banished nightmares but called something more horrific.

With aliens attacking your planets, and with civilians trying to escape, you’re not going to be able to hold on to everything you’ve got. But having no planets is better than having them captured. So sometimes, you have to turn the guns on your own, and sacrifice all you’ve fought for.\n\nInstructions:\nAliens have come to destroy your planets! Your civilians need to evacuate, and they're putting their trust in you to buy them time. How long can you hold off the invaders to let your citizens escape?\n\nControls: WASD or the arrow keys to move your ship.\n\nLeft Click to fire your guns and destroy the aliens!\n\nRight click on planets to sacrifice them (blow them up) to prevent aliens from taking them over! Note: Planets can only be sacrificed when their shields are completely reduced.\n\nObjective:\nTo try to get the highest score possible! Points can be gained by:\n-Destroying Aliens\n-Surviving Waves\n-Evacuating Civilians\nCivilians can only be evacuated between enemy waves.\n\nYou can lose points by: \n-Having a Planet Invaded\n-Losing Turrets\n\nTypes of Aliens:\nSpeeders: These tiny cruisers are fast and furious, but their shields are very weak. Don’t let their blasters tear you apart!\n\nCarriers: Big ships with lots of shields. They spawn speeders and fire big bullets that tear your planets apart.\n\nBombers: Small, slow ships with big guns. They will target your turrets, so be careful! (Image of bomber)\n\nLanders: These slow ships neutralize your planets when they lose their shields. Don’t let them capture your worlds or face a massive point reduction.\n\nTurrets: Like your turrets, but bad. Also you can’t destroy them.

As Santa, you must fight through the horde and make your way to the rooftops to deliver the presents safely. Throw snowballs at the trolls to knock them out. Get caught, and you will have to sacrifice some of your presents to the troll before he'll release you. Sacrifice too many presents, and there won't be enough to give to every kid on your list. You'll have a few extra presents in case you need them, but they are limited. See if you can finish your route with a perfect delivery record!\n\nUse \"A\" and \"D\" to move. \"Spacebar\" to jump. \"Left Mouse\" to throw snowballs. \"Esc\" to quit.\n\nSome Notes About the Game: All graphics and sound assets were downloaded from the Unity Asset Store, so I opted out of these categories. Also, the original plan for the \"sacrifice\" theme was this: When a troll caught you, he would demand that you sacrifice some presents before he would let you go free. If you chose not to sacrifice the presents, you'd lose health. If you lost all health, it was game over. Unfortunately I ran out of time to implement this correctly so the trolls just steal your presents and run away.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2c1/e1/z/1e48c.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/santa-clause-troll-hunter","author":{"name":"Cindys Arcade","uid":123330,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2c1/e1/z/1b0c3.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/cindys-arcade"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://cindysarcade.itch.io/santa-clause-troll-hunter"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Pursuit","category":"jam","description":"Life is tough!

You also cannot fight monsters yourself. All of this must be done by your followers.\n\n-You can micromanage followers by picking them up and putting them back down where you need something done, however.\n\n-The final challenge of the game is to build the dark portal and summon Satan, which costs a lot of time and resources, and has disastrous consequences.\n\n\n\n**I think figuring out the details of how most of the game works by yourself is the most fun, but here are a bunch of extra tricks to look over if you have a hard time getting started:**\n\n\n**Ressources:**\n\n-Your 3 resources are Cash, Piety and Ambiance.\n\n-Cash is needed for all constructions and is generated over time by your cultists, and by merch booths. You also get some gold whenever you kill monsters infesting your temple grounds.\n\n-Piety is needed for some of the more occult constructions and to use dark magic, and is slowly generated by having cultists sit in pews or chairs to pray.\n\n-Ambiance is not exactly a resource, it's more like a rating of how spooky your temple is. High ambiance brings more followers over time, makes them part with their money faster and increases the effectiveness of many of your constructions.\n\n![Screen3.gif](///raw/9b1/3/z/1e4d7.gif)\n\n\n**Constructions:**\n\n-Build a library (and later an alchemy lab) to research new constructions.\n\n-Different constructions are available to build at different areas of your temple (outside, inside, and in the central sanctuary)\n\n-Most constructions you build affect the ambiance of your cult. Some buildings add to ambiance (statues, lit braziers, altars...) and others reduce it (folding chairs, merch booths, catering table)\n\n-Constructions placed outside the walls of your central building have a lessened impact (be it negative or positive) on your ambiance, and constructions placed within the central room have doubled ambiance impact.\n\n\n**Cultists:**\n\n-Devoted cultists are the backbone of your operation, and they do everything. They construct buildings, operate them, fight monsters and even produce cash.\n\n-Cultists regenerate health over time, but reanimated corpses do not, you will just need to reanimate them again at the Wicked Idol if they collapse.\n\n-You can direct them to clear debris obstructing the path deeper into your temple grounds, and seal monster-spawning objects like rat nests.\n\n-Cultists need food and drink! Build a kiosk somewhere or they will eventually stop working, leave your temple, or even die.\n\n-Cultists gain experience through many tasks. Higher-level cultists perform better, and are stronger in combat.\n\n-Sacrificing cultists to the altar using the bloody knife fills it with blood, which readies it to be worshiped by other \ncultists and generate piety.

Sometimes, however, it's just not worth the risk of death. So, what's a professor to do? Send in the interns, of course! The plan is send in some interns to scout out the place. You may have to sacrifice a few of them to figure out the safest paths. Then, send in more interns to grab the treasure. Meanwhile, you get all the credit. And the treasure, of course.\n\nYou will choose from among three temples and send wave after wave of your own interns towards the treasure. If your interns meet with an accident, just click the \"Run!\" button to whistle up some more. If your interns stop to catch their breath, hit the same button to make them start running again. If you find your interns repeatedly falling into traps, remember to look around for switches to click. Those spikes don't look nearly as scary with a bridge covering them! Also, be alert!

In the end, we had to simplify the goal of the game. There should have been 5 artifacts to collect to win the game, but unfortunately, we have to stick with an enemy count mechanic to end the game for know. So all you need to collect so far is the blood for the ring in the center of the map. Also, we would have liked to have a couple more hours to tweak the spawns and mechanics of the enemies, to make a more satisfying difficulty curve in the game. And then there are some UI ideas (options etc) we couldn't finish on time. \n\n![titel Ludum.jpg](///raw/fac/e1/z/1e27d.jpg)\n\nWhat we've done until now: https://jamjamteam.itch.io/\nOur first LD

There is no way the militia is up to the task, and, alas, your spells and effects are too weak to tip the balance.\n\nUnless... you were to crack open your book of Forbidden Magic. Powered by more than pricked fingers and vials of sheep's blood, these spells may just be the tool required to save us. Well, most of us. The townsfolk will understand as, if any of us are to see the dawn...\n\nHow many sacrifices must be made?\n\n![unknown2.jpg](///raw/191/z/1e3ff.jpg)\n\n![unknown4.jpg](///raw/191/z/1e422.jpg)\n\n### Technical details\n\nBuilt with [SpringRTS](https://springrts.com).

You now have about a second to get away from there.\n   * Fixed the enemy's off-screen firing guardrail - they were only supposed to fire while completely visible, but I did my math wrong. Also, their shot timer will no longer tick unless they are fully visible, too. This will reduce the amount of peek-a-boo pot-shot the second they return to the screen.\n   * When respawning (and spawning in for the first time), the amount of enemies left is displayed in the center of the screen. previously, the only hint you had was Leslie telling you \"we're halfway there!\" and that was only if another piece of dialog was not already playing lol.\n* Fixed (12/5, 8:05PM)\n   * Fixed the game landing directly into the gameplay and skipping the main menu and intro cinematic.............................................

You play as a wizard who is returning to his home village, only to find out that the village is under attack by a horde of monsters. You must make your way through the various passageways in order to make your way to the village, choosing either to fight and protect the villagers (Gaining the power of the Light - Reducing Enemy Rage, and thus Enemy Health), or avoid fighting and stock up on power to increase your damage.

Nothing original at all (a very bad clone of the must-have Lemmings), but I wished that, for once, I could make a better game than my previous entries for many (too many) previous LD's. But my old ennemies still are there. Collisions not working, strange and unexpected behaviors, silly bugs… Well, the time I saved while finding an idea way sooner than usual, was lost way speeder than usual. And I ended hurrying until the very last minute, as usual. But, hey, this is LD, it's fun. But, sometimes, I wonder if I will have all the fun, at least… Once? Next time, I hope. :smile:  \n  \nSo, the game. Some Yel's will go out from the trap(s) - in blue - and want to find the exit - in white. You have some limited tasks/abilities that you can give to them, in order to prevent them from an awfull dead. The stopper stay in the way, forcing the other Yel's to go back. The shoveler dig the next obstacle in front of him. The driller dig right below him until he falls. The miner too, but he dig in diagonal. The jumper and the climber have the abilities, respectively, of falling from heights without crashing like an egg, and climbing (I'm afraid that this one is pretty buggy, and horribly slow) - those two are permanent, and can be combined. The builder will make stairs, until he runs out of steps (8), or he's blocked. The kamikaze will act as a stopper, until the 5 seconds are down, then he die in a little explosion. Stoppers can be removed by making them blow, or if someone dig under them. You can slow down or speed up the Yel's out frequency by using the buttons up-left. If you are stuck, you can blow up everyone by clicking the button up-right (only if all the Yel's are out). You need to save at least a certain number of Yel's every level, but I forgot to show how much (however, when it's good, the \"saved\" count is green). There is only four levels, and it's yet a miracle, giving the late moment I started the level design. (try to) Enjoy, and thank you for testing my ~~buggy~~ game. :laughing:   \n  \n*Note : after publication and due to comments, I added some buttons on the main page to access the levels already done (it was meant, but I forgot in the final hurry -_-; )*","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b3/z/1e7ca.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/save-the-yels","author":{"name":"LeReveur","uid":59,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b3/z/3d10.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/lereveur"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b3/z/1e7ca.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b3/z/1e7ca.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://workshop.xenedon.com/LD43/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Feasts must be made!","category":"jam","description":"![start.png](///raw/edd/2/z/1e391.png)  ![pr.png](///raw/edd/2/z/1e3b9.png)\n\n\nIn __Feasts must be made!__ you are the captain of a boat being held captive by Bacchus, he heard you criticize parties and wants to punish you. He did not imprison you so that you could harvest fruits to make offerings and feed him. Until then, he will keep your crew members imprisoned in small cages. You have to feed Bacchus with fruits before he gets mad at you and punishes you and your captive team. \n\n\nAs a certain someone would say: \"Logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few\". So, if you have no other choice, you can sacrifice one of your crew members to feed him a lot at once. Take care, though! Each time you sacrifice someone, there is one less fruit spawn available and your lowered morale makes you run slower.  \n\n### TL;DR : Pick up fruits (with E) and drop them on the altar at the bottom right (with e) to feed bacchus before the end of the countdown. If you're short on time don't have enough fruits dropped on the altar, you can sacrifice someone by standing on his cage and pressing e. ###\n\n\nThanks to Baboulinet & Maz for being great guinea pigs! :)  \n\n*[French speakers passing by, please take a look at a little something I wrote for the game](https://www.facebook.com/notes/caffeinated-psychics/ludum-dare-43/1221124601370882).*\n\n\nControls | Function\n---------|---------\nWASD & the Arrows | Move your character  \n E | Pick up fruits, sacrifice someone, drop fruits on the altar  \nH | Display the help in game  \nM | Mute music  \nPage Up / Down | Raise / Lower volume  \nR | Restart the level\n\n\nPS : There seems to be a problem with resolutions, please play in 1280*720 or if you're playing on the web build, please avoid maximizing the game window.

Once our greatest ally, the element itself has turned against us, with conflagrations now a part of daily life. Can your intrepid squad of firefighters possibly keep up?!\n\n# Instructions:\nThis is a unit micromanagement game about running around and putting out fires to save various towns. \n- Put out all fires to beat the level\n- Click firefighter to select\n- Right click on a tile to move firefighter\n- Move a firefighter to a tile that is on fire to put it out You have to right click the tile, not the building)\n- Once a tile has been put out, it will stay out for a short time\n- A and D keys to rotate camera around map\n\n# Postmortem\nThe original plan was for the firefighters to persist between levels with bonuses granted based on which buildings were saved. That way, you'd have to pick which buildings to save and which to sacrifice. We also wanted you to sometimes have to sacrifice some of your guys to to win, for an extra layer of themeness. Of course, for that to matter we needed levels, and for that a level editor (note: we did not actually really probably need a level editor), so we ran out of time. We might work on it a bit more and add in some of the depth we never got around to.\n\n# Credits\n- Design/Programming - Logan Stolmaker, Davide Spiert, Mark Pressler\n- Art/Effects - Davide Spiert\n- Level Design - Mark Pressler \n\n\n# Tools\n- Unity 2018\n- Gimp\n- Krita\n- Photoshop Cloud\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//470/3/z/1f708.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/renegade-fire","author":{"name":"Prakkus","uid":12404,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/prakkus"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://prakkus.itch.io/renegade-fire"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Esus","category":"jam","description":"![tło.png](///raw/efa/d1/z/1e2f1.png)\nOur first LD ends successfully.

But as I was brainstorming for ideas for this theme, I realized I could adapt the ideas of that game and use them for this jam, so this is a reimagining of Bobble Battle, built from the ground up from all-new code and graphics.\n\nThis is the first time I've taken it upon myself to create all of the assets for a game jam by myself. Before I started working on the graphics Saturday morning I didn't even know I had any skill in creating sprites from scratch.\n\nWhile I did create the sound effects, I took them from a library of assets that I created in the past, so they aren't eligible for scoring in the jam.\n\nThe underlying HTML5 game development toolkit is also of my own construction. I didn't build it during the jam, but it doesn't provide anything that you wouldn't get from Unity3D, GameMaker: Studio, or any other development environment. All of the game logic, AI, physics, controls, and interface were built during the jam. I'll be releasing the tools open-source for other developers to use once I've finished filling in some missing pieces.\n\nLicense\n=======\nCopyright (c) 2018 Adam Higerd\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

A high score chaser where you play as a little dragon navigating a dangerous dungeon in search of loot to take back to your treasure hoard. Grow larger as you collect coins, gems, and other valuable items to increase your score multiplier in order to gain even more points in your pursuit of a high score. Be Careful though, should you run into any obstacle or wall, you’ll end your run. Your score multiplier is based on your Dragon length, thus you must reach full size to add a score multiplier effect, and before you see gems and better items appear beyond the classic coins. If you run into yourself at any time, you will sacrifice your body at the point of impact causing you to lose your score multiplier and have to build it back up, but you will be able to continue your high scoring run. When you die, you will be offered the opportunity to sacrifice some of your collected loot, in the form of your best items, the things you have worked so hard for and the things you treasure the most, to continue your run. To achieve your highest score, decisions will be presented, and sacrifices must be made.\n\nHungry Hungry Dragons uses hand drawn pixel art. Moving forward with the game, we plan on expanding out the roster of Dragons to showcase many more Dragon looks and styles created by our artists. These Dragons can be collected by hatching eggs acquired in game using the coins collected. At certain intervals throughout the game, the Dragons can actually grow and mature into large adult Dragons. \n\nDungeon rooms in Hungry Hungry Dragons are procedurally generated offering different runs every playthrough. Pre-designed rooms will also be created to offer a more challenging experience, with some of these rooms even offering up puzzle like conditions to escape to the next room. \n\nIn Hungry Hungry Dragons, the Dragon with the largest treasure hoard is the best. You’ll be able to compete against fellow Dragons and show off your highest scoring treasure hoard complete with all the special and rare items you’ve found along the way. \n\nWe hope you enjoy this small demo of Hungry Hungry Dragons as there is so much we have lined up for the complete full version. \n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e5d/51/z/1e1fd.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/hungry-hungry-dragons","author":{"name":"Kelly Maguire","uid":122063,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/kelly-maguire"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e5d/51/z/1e2d0.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e5d/51/z/1e2d0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":" https://appatheia.itch.io/hungy-hungry-dragon"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Goats in the Grotto","category":"jam","description":"![IMG_0067.PNG](///raw/449/c/z/1e29e.png)\n\nIf the play button isn't working click on the bottom of it.\n\nA lonesome Shepard forced by the hand of an overly greedy government, must embark on a journey to the deep dark regions of the underworld.

Everything is from scratch, but the base art was made by a friend watching the stream (more than just programmer art <3). Sounds were all from my own very mouth, programming was unique (with a few statements here and there found on StackOverflow :P), and I ended with lots of time to spare!

Oops.\n* In-game instructions and maybe a \"First time playing? Watch this!\"\n* Changing the end screen text for certain amounts saved (e.g. \"You saved 0. Nice job?\")\n* Regaining health via 4 in 1 trip?\n* Sprint with regaining per delivered cat?\n* Actual score\n* Camera zoom and effects per amount of health\n* More feedback for actions.

Same is used for attacking enemies. Once a wave of enemies has been defeated, you are presented with a choice between keeping your current weapon, or trying your luck and getting a new weapon. Weapons can level up, so sacrificing your current weapon can result in a temporary, or permanent, setback. Either way, _sacrifices must be made_ to grow ever more powerful, to gain the necessary equipment to defeat the 6 waves of invading enemies.\n\n![1df84.png](///raw/d50/2/z/1f22a.png)\n\n## :shinto_shrine: Background\nThis is our first 3D game where we've had movable characters and an environment, and WOW! Working with 3D and 3D-animation sure ain't no joke! Whether we talk about the modelling, UV-mapping, texturing, rigging, and smacking the animation on top of it all AND make it all work in the game engine. Respect for graphic artists! We had plans on adding some enemy types and even a boss, but due to some rigging problems we completed only one character, which doubled up as both the playable Samurai character and the Terracotta enemies (Chinese, we know, but desperate times require desperate measures!).\n\nFUN FACT: Did you know that the Japanese used to lacquer pretty much everything that was worth lacquering? During the warring states period they manufactured a stupendous amount of guns and armour, and they were frequently lacquered so that they would not rust. Henry Ford, allegedly inspired by Japanese technique of lacquering what-ever-have-you, decided to solve his problem of automobiles rusting by lacquering them.\n\n![2018-12-05-211024_1883x1184_scrot.png](///raw/d50/2/z/1f228.png)\n\n## :japanese_goblin: Known issues\n\n* Collision bugs. There are parts of the surrounding mountain that don't properly prevent the character to move through. Some collision shapes are too big and some too small.\n* Finicky clicking. The part that registers clicks/movement is a bit small, and a bit bugged in the engine. It is possible to drag the mouse to move around, but if you stop dragging, it won't follow the mouse cursor. Clicking on the player sprite or other objects can fail to properly register as a movement.\n\n## :bento: Tips\n\n* The goal is to get in as many hits while taking as few as possible. Don't let more than one enemy hit you at a time. Try to hit them without they hitting back.\n* The weapons have a tier, which is displayed in front of the level in square brackets. The tiers are Basic, Common, Magic, Rare, and Legendary. The higher the tier, the more stats and higher damage numbers it can roll.\n* Lines which question marks in the weapon choice screen show that the sword has a stat.

Since this is the first time I've done a real game jam it's probably a little rough around the edges, but hey, it sorta works. Everything was created in 72 hours except the Unity engine and its default post-processing effects. The biggest sacrifice in order to fit the time limit was the ability to come up with a good title.\n\nThe game itself is quite short, consisting of 7 stages of (hopefully) increasing chaos and difficulty, and features a combined 3-D and pixel art style. Each stage the maximum weight you're allowed to carry decreases, so you may have to sacrifice items as the game goes on. Eventually, there are magic attacks which don't weight a lot, but instead drain your health! I haven't tested it enough to know how hard it really is, but it is possible to beat. I think.\n\nCreated primarily with Unity 2018.2.8, Blender 2.79, Krita 4, Audacity, and Visual Studio. Everything that you see was made specifically for this jam with the exception of the fonts, which I made for another project a few years ago.\n\n![screen2.png](///raw/604/f1/z/1e29d.png)\n![screen3.png](///raw/604/f1/z/1e2aa.png)\n![screen4.png](///raw/604/f1/z/1e2ad.png)\n\nThe game \"window\" can be resized using the plus and minus keys any time when the game is open.

When burying his son, Lucifer appears and offers Vincent a way to bring his son back to life. \n\n![ss_intro2.png](///raw/ecb/c/z/1eed2.png)\n\nVincent is taken to Lucifers dungeon, and told he must prove how much he wants his son back through fighting his way through the dungeon. \n\n![ss_intro3.png](///raw/ecb/c/z/1eed3.png)\n\nDuring this trial, Vincent can gain help from Lucifer: reviving yourself when dead, helping you clear / solve a dungeon room, providing you with improved character stats. \n\n![ss_sacrifice3.png](///raw/ecb/c/z/1eed4.png)\n\nHowever, all of these come at a cost: losing character stats, making immoral decisions, making the end boss fight more difficult. \n\n![ss_sacrifice2.png](///raw/ecb/c/z/1eed7.png)\n\n![ss_death2.png](///raw/ecb/c/z/1eed9.png)\n\nVincent must make it to Lucifer at the end of the dungeon, in order to bring back his little baby rabbit son. \n\n# How To Play\nClear the rooms of the dungeon until you face your final test. Monster rooms need all monsters cleared before you can move on to the next room. Gauntlet rooms require you to simply get to the end of the room and avoid all the traps. Puzzle rooms require switches to be activated in order to open the exit door. Sacrifice rooms require you to make a moral decision before you can progress to the next room.\n\nWhen you die, you can be resurrected. You will have sacrifice your stats when doing so (Max HP, Attack, Defence, Attack Speed, Move Speed).

It's time for you to gather your crew, board the Coalheart, and set sail for the rich trade routes of the Bermuda Triangle. Find those laden merchants by the sound of their chanties, then give them a taste of your thermal ray or your broadside cannons. Send them to the depth, and be sure to get their loot on board before it too sinks. Once your hold is as full as can be, head back to your home port to cash in your prize.\n\nBut be careful. There's something dark in these waters. And it has a taste for blackhearted pirate souls. Like a shark, it will follow the smell of your blood through the water, getting ever hungrier and faster. But you're no frightened landlubber. And besides, there's an old sea dog's trick: The one thing these eldritch horrors like chasing more than your pirate ship are dark souls offered to it in sacrifice. So find yourself some \"volunteers\" amongst your crew members and have them walk the plank. Of course, whomever your sacrifice won't be doing his job no more, so your ship's performance will suffer in some way. But the Coalheart can get by on a skeleton crew if need be. And on the bright side, dead man don't get their cut from the loot.\n\n------\n\nWell, I finished the game, just barely. It doesn't nearly have all the features I wanted to implement (like decent Merchant AI that fights back, lookout-crewmembers that show you indicators to merchant ships, or even a start menu), but I hope you'll have some fun playing it nonetheless.\n\nThe game was made by me, Bificommander, in Unity. It uses some standard Unity assets, and a collection of free sound effects.\n\nPress Esc for a list of controls. The game ends when you die or when you return to the green homebase that you start at. Note that for the final score, the amount of loot you collected and remaining HP are counted, but the number of crew members you sacrificed is not. Can you make it to the Dread Pirate rating?\n\nPost-jam update: I put in an hour or two of extra work to polish the game up slightly. It now has the in-game UI that I removed because it wasn't done, has some changes to the map that prevent you or the merchants from getting stuck so easily, plus some minor interface tweaks. It is definitely the game experience I recommend, but if you want to be strict with your rating, the original is what I finished by the Jam deadline.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ecf/c/z/1e137.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/steampirates-of-bermuda","author":{"name":"Bificommander","uid":53198,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/bificommander"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ecf/c/z/1f27e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ecf/c/z/1f27e.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SU22aSGA6IT2v9bX23r24gOeK-_FzxK1"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://bificommander.itch.io/steampiratesofbermuda"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GXy4Ck529rHFjvQAhSfrJCqYSdA_pKM_"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CKfMsbLJlGcnCPZ8TJkWR18_JfR7-nOJ"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1y8onnVqvsv3Rou_K3sw0Xtbn8dODBTfm"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Die or Die (or not, whatever)","category":"jam","description":"In this game you can die, or kill, or sacrifice, or do nothing - it's totally your problems.\n\nNo balance, deadly hard, horde of monsters, pretty bad princess - this all for you :heartpulse:.\n\nAnd One More Thing ((c) Steve Jobs) - anyway you will lose (SPOILER ALERT!).\n\n![1.jpg](///raw/234/e1/z/1de74.jpg)\n![2.jpg](///raw/234/e1/z/1de7a.jpg)\n![3.jpg](///raw/234/e1/z/1de7d.jpg)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//234/e1/z/1d19f.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/die-or-die-or-not-whatever","author":{"name":"samaranin","uid":123954,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//234/e1/z/1ced3.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/samaranin"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//234/e1/z/1de74.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//234/e1/z/1de74.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//234/e1/z/1de7a.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//234/e1/z/1de7a.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//234/e1/z/1de7d.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//234/e1/z/1de7d.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=12cQc2psGNbZQkQ18aa6nHfqHSk_sQUUO"},{"label":"Other","url":""}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Coming Home","category":"jam","description":"In our game, it’s the end of holidays for the little Timmy and he has to go back to his planet, Zultron.\nYour objective is to reach Zultron (the planet on the right of the map) but you have limited energy and every step consumes it.

In order to balance these goals, we decided that shooting with either gun should stop your forward motion so it would be a sacrifice and then there would be no disincentive not to fire the second gun at the same time. Therefore, shooting still results in an important player choice between advancing towards the goal (fighting the timer) or fighting the despicable wildlife aiming to steal your honeyed health points while maximizing shooting when the player chooses to stop.\n\nOur \"feel\" is highly influenced by [this talk](https://bit.ly/2FHhE4Y) from [Vlambeer](https://www.vlambeer.com/)'s Jan Willem Nijman and we would be amiss not to give it credit.

With limited energy at your disposal - and limited windows to strike your opponent - you must carefully balance your spacecraft's offensive and defensive capabilities. Will you sacrifice your shields for an all-out assault, or will you have to divert energy from your super weapon at the last second to fend off an attack? Maybe you can even trade your orbital high ground for faster energy gains? Choose carefully, but beware. Even the best laid plans can blow up in your face like a missile out of the black!\n \n.\n\n# How to play\n\nIf you've ever played FTL, you already know the basics:\n\n\n![laser_crop00b.png](///raw/01b/91/z/1f600.png)\n\nThis is your energy. You start with 3 points, and earn 2 more for every orbit you survive.\n\n.\n\n![laser_crop01.png](///raw/01b/91/z/1f601.png)\n\nClick on a system (like laser) to assign an energy point to it. It will take a few seconds to power up.\n\n*You can also click on already-assigned points to remove and redistribute them.*\n\n![laser_crop02.png](///raw/01b/91/z/1f602.png)\n\nAssign another point to speed up charging time.\n\n*Adding more energy doesn't always speed up charging. Adding a third point to laser, for example, will make it more powerful instead of faster to charge.*\n\n![laser_crop03.png](///raw/01b/91/z/1f603.png)\n\nA system is ready to fire when **A)** it's fully charged, and **B)** the enemy is within range.

Garry is a caveman who woke one morning believing he was the actual child of Satan and all he wants to do in life is to follow the path to his fathers home ... Hell.\n\nYour objective is to make Garry see reason and bombard him with positive energy (by constructing Positivity Towers and loading them with energy orbs).\n\nAround the map you may notice different type of animals moving around. You have to sacrifice those animals in order to gain resources to build structures. There are 4 types of animals and each animal gives different resources when killed:\n![Animals2.PNG](///raw/da3/z/1f913.png)\nThere are four basic resources:\n![Resources.PNG](///raw/da3/z/1f90f.png)\n\nThere are seven different types of structures:\n\n### Bolders: \n![BolderButtonR.png](///raw/da3/z/1f908.png)\nCan be placed on Garry's path in order to slow him down. Garry will gain a bit of strength every time he kills a bolder so use bolders carefully.\n### Cooked Plate: \n![PlateButtonR.png](///raw/da3/z/1f909.png)\nGarry doesn't enjoy raw animal flesh. But he is known to love some barbecued slices of meat. Used it the same way as bolders by placing them on Garry's path.\n### Bone Catapults: \n![CatapultButtonR.png](///raw/da3/z/1f90a.png)\nAlong with Positivity Towers, catapults are the other type of \"throwable\" structure. Place them on the ground on an empty tile and feed it some flesh from your inventory in order to load it. Catapults have a cooldown after throwing flesh at Garry. If Garry's health goes to zero he must stop to rest before he continues. Loading catapults with meat bolders costs 1 flesh.\n### Bone Remover: \n![BoneRemoverButtonR.png](///raw/da3/z/1f90b.png)\nAllows you to create bones from animals\n### Baseball Bat: \n![BaseballBatChamberButtonR.png](///raw/da3/z/1f90c.png)\nUsed to beat an animal to death. Not very efficient at gathering flesh or bones but very good for collecting animal tears.\n### Barbecue grill: \n![GrillButtonR.png](///raw/da3/z/1f90d.png)\nUsed to make delicious barbecued slices of meat for Garry to eat.\n### Positivity Tower: \n![HappyTowerButtonR.png](///raw/da3/z/1f90e.png)\nWorks the same way as catapults, but instead of throwing meat at Garry's face, it launches positivity orbs. If Garry reaches a \"positivity\" value of 100 before he sacrifices himself on the pit of hell you win the game. Loading towers with positivity orbs costs 1 tear.\n\n\nNOTE: In order to play you need an internet connection! Game fetches other players maps from a a MySQL database.\n\n## Basic Controls:\n\n\"A\" \"W\" \"S\" \"D\" moves the camera.\n\"Escape\" to access the menu.\n\n## Map Maker Instructions:\n\nThe map maker allows you to generate maps with a limited size of 15. You can draw 5 different type of terrains, place 4 different types of animals and 5 different types of decorative objects (sry didn't have time to add more than 5 :P).\n\nUse left click to add object and right click to remove it. If you hold left mouse button you cal also draw the terrain and Garry's path.\n\n\nWhen you save a map you are asked for 3 values: \n\n### Map name: \nThe map name is unique so you can't create a map with the name of a map that already exists.\n### Creator: \nThis is you! Type whatever you like to identify yourself with :P\n### Password: \nWhen you create a map you provide a password for that map. That password is necessary so only the creator of a map can delete that map from the database (I can also delete maps with a special password so don't worry :P).\n\n## Actual Game Instructions:\n\n-> When the game starts there is a countdown of 30 seconds so you can prepare yourself before Garry starts his journey to the Pit of Hell.\n\n-> On the left side of the map you have a panel with a health slider(red) and a positivity slider (yellow). Bellow those sliders there is a number that represents Garry's strength. Garry's strength represents the damage per second he does to Bolders and Plates of barbecue.\n\n-> On the top right side you can see your resources.\n\n-> On the bottom you can see the 7 structures you can construct (as described above).\n\n#### -> Use left mouse  click to attack an animal and right mouse  click to grab him. Grabbing animals is required in order to use some structures like the Bone Remover or the Baseball Bat. If you are grabbing an animal and press the right mouse click you drop that animal.\n\n## Objective:\n\nPrevent Garry from sacrificing himself to Satan on the Pit of Hell\n\n\n## Tools:\n\n->> Unity,\n\n->> Blender\n\n->> PHP (for recording Maps)\n\n->> paint.NET\n\n\n## Screenshoots:\n\n![Screenshoot1.png](///raw/da3/z/1f51a.png)\n\n![Screenshoot2.png](///raw/da3/z/1f51b.png)\n\n![Screenshoot3.png](///raw/da3/z/1f51d.png)\n\n![Screenshoot4.png](///raw/da3/z/1f51e.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//da3/z/1e6da.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/garrys-sacrifice","author":{"name":"Mordokay","uid":941,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/mordokay"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//da3/z/1f913.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//da3/z/1f913.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//da3/z/1f90f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//da3/z/1f90f.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//da3/z/1f908.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//da3/z/1f908.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//da3/z/1f909.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//da3/z/1f909.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//da3/z/1f90a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//da3/z/1f90a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//da3/z/1f90b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//da3/z/1f90b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//da3/z/1f90c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//da3/z/1f90c.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//da3/z/1f90d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//da3/z/1f90d.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//da3/z/1f90e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//da3/z/1f90e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//da3/z/1f51a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//da3/z/1f51a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//da3/z/1f51b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//da3/z/1f51b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//da3/z/1f51d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//da3/z/1f51d.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//da3/z/1f51e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//da3/z/1f51e.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/Mordokay/LudumDare43"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Da4M-0YU_gaWk-GBE8GCqr9_QeOOvqZJ/view?usp=sharing"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KCAo4483td8eTiL7bBmEb4zYiPrkAxM2/view?usp=sharing"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/132cQ-yX3U-7YwU_huuNKsyqdRBnCVBaX/view?usp=sharing"},{"label":"web","url":"http://mordokay.com/webgl/Games/LD43/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Kaiten","category":"jam","description":"Game inspired by a history of suicide torpedoes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiten : \n\nKaiten (回天, literal translation: \"Return to Heaven\", commonly rendered as \"turn of the Heaven's will\", \"the heaven shaker\") were manned torpedoes and suicide craft, used by the Imperial Japanese Navy in the final stages of World War II\n\nTarget: Destroy enemy ship.

Unfortunately this hidout is in somewhere in the middle of a well populated area. But sometimes sacrifices must be made to make the world a better place.\n\n**How to Play**\n- Connect to ANY relay antenna by truning the HORIZONTAL/VERTICAL Dial until you can hear a clear signal with NO BACKGROUND NOISE and the signal indicator is full. Press the LOCK Button.\n\n- Rotate the relay antenna with HORIZONTAL dial until you your can hear the TARGET SIGNAL. This signal is on the note on the monitor. You are looking for a morse code coresponding with the code on the note. When you have found the signal press LOCK again. Sometimes to signals can overlap eachother making it hard to tell them apart. If this happends you will have to guess where the signal is.\n\n- You should now see a circle on the MAPSCREEN, your target is somewhere in the colored part of the circle. Repeat the steps above until you have a few circles overlaping each other.\n\n- To fire the missile at the taget position, flip the white switch. You should now see a circle around the crosshair. Position the crosshair on the guessed target location and set the blast raduis with the RADUIS dail. You want to keep the raduis as small as possible to avoid unnecessary casualties. Flip the ARM MISSILE switch and press FIRE to launch the missile. Good Luck\n\nKeep in mind you are on a time limit. If the timer hits 00:00 the target will escape. \n\n**Controls:**\n  - Use scrollwheel to turn dial.\n  - Press buttons with mouse.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//871/3/z/1ea4c.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/destructor-32-gms","author":{"name":"Erik Brunnstrom","uid":12664,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//871/3/z/2cb6.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/erik-brunnstrom"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//871/3/z/1ea47.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//871/3/z/1ea47.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//871/3/z/1ea4f.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//871/3/z/1ea4f.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NQ0WjV-60hQHN2T7v3ZXGAocyt3B3GB2"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Trial of a Warrior","category":"jam","description":"Some say, only in battle is a warrior truly tested.

That's how a building in flames came to mind. \n\nThe intention was to creat a balance between each kind of person, so e.g. rescuing an elders would take more time but account for more points. Due to time constraints this feature was not so well explored though. Another idea was showing the death toll at the end, together with a list and description of the people you were not able to save, to reinforce the idea of sacrifice. Ideally we wanted to be able to calculate the optimum outcome of rescuing and, if the player achieve this outcome, he would win the game. This was somehow done but not as precise as we would like.\n\nOverall the game still needs a lot of adjustments, but it looks not so bad for a two day challenge!\n\nLink to play:\nhttps://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/cart_info.php?cid=hoherahofi-0\n\n\nPreview:\n![5.gif](///raw/7f3/02/z/1dee8.gif)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7f3/02/z/1de95.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/save-da-people","author":{"name":"ehauckdo","uid":132087,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7f3/02/z/1f686.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/ehauckdo"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7f3/02/z/1dee8.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7f3/02/z/1dee8.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://github.com/ehauckdo/ludumdare43"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Sacrafices_LD43","category":"jam","description":"### A game about sacrificing your Cult members!\n\n#### Find, knockout , and drag your cult members to the alter before the cult leader catches you!\n\n##### Controller supported\n\n\n\n### HOW TO PLAY\n\n1.

It's okay.\n\nJohn is part of a new experiment. The goal is to examine the importance of audio and visuals in videogames and to see what happens when you remove either or both. As usual, John is willing to sacrifice everything.\n\nDevelopers note:\nThis game is really hard. Like really hard.\nThe game consist of 7 levels. Every time you finish the level, you have to choose between sacrificing part of your vision or hearing. The goal is to win the game while being completely blind and deaf.\n\nThe game is made by Anders Poulsen, Jeppe Emil Lindskov, Mads Riddersholm, Mikkel Isak Anttila & Rasmus Thorup.\nAll code, art, sound, music and other assets are made by us, except for the character controller which is made by Martin Fasterholdt.

But it's alright, because sometimes sacrifices must be made to get what you want.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8b7/8/z/1e043.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/blob-time","author":{"name":"sketchycode","uid":34744,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/sketchycode"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//69d/9/z/1e4b1.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//69d/9/z/1e4b1.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/sketchycode/LD43"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://ameliawinstead.com/samples/LD43/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Necro Moe","category":"jam","description":"This game is an RTS horror game\nkind of like plant vs zombie but with different mechanics\n\nhow to play:\n- kill the humans by summoning zombies\n- every time you zombie kill a human it will collect soul\n- collect the sould by changing to harvest mode by clicking the harvest button and swipe the zombies neck\n- if your zombie dies then the soul is gone!\n![Screenshot_29.png](///raw/f12/e1/z/1e3f5.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f12/e1/z/1e407.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/necro-moe","author":{"name":"Lostrick","uid":123423,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/lostrick"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f12/e1/z/1e3f5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f12/e1/z/1e3f5.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://lostrick.itch.io/necro-moe"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Falling Star","category":"jam","description":"Help your star to cross the galaxy!!\n\nCredits:\nHenrique Matarazo Camillo\nMatheus Bragança\nWillian Gonzaga Leodegario","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d47/f1/z/1df2e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/falling-star","author":{"name":"Henrique Camillo","uid":128845,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/henrique-camillo"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://henriquecamillo.itch.io/fallingstar"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://henriquecamillo.itch.io/fallingstar"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://henriquecamillo.itch.io/fallingstar"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux","mac"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"GameDev Sacrifices","category":"jam","description":"![header](///raw/f17/1/z/1db7f.png)\n\n## About\n\nSo many things to do, so little time...\n\nWhat are you willing to sacrifice to make a game?\n\nAnd what will your sacrifices bring you?\n\n![enemy](///raw/f17/1/z/1d641.gif)\n\n## Goal\nDefeat four stages of game development disguised as monsters:\n1.

You will become the best artist no matter the cost!!!\n\nYou can: Draw, Eat, Sleep and Train. To do that type the word. \n\n- When drawing you have to draw what you see. Each correct word makes your combo go higher. The higher your combo the more points you get. And the faster your motivation goes up constantly.\n- When eating you have to choose between 2 words.

Complete with a full quota of weapons instructions in the practice mode and 1 player mode. Controls have been updated too. Please play and rate the jam version for all of its flaws and if there is enough there to grab your interest please play the finished version. I would love feedback on it. I am very pleased with it. It is as much a musical instrument as it is a shooter. \n\nTo fire requires you to sacrifice hp, it is possible to shoot yourself to death. You can pick some of the hp up again or collect it from your opponent. Don't worry about it too much, if you are close enough to it the hp will find you. All white Bokeh are hp. \n\nEnjoy \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWARNING THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE YOU WILL GET INSTRUCTIONS. I ran out of time to get the instructions done.\n\nUntested and incomplete. There is so much still to do but this was the best I could do and I am satisfied I grafted.\n\n![Screenshot (3).png](///raw/68e/c/z/1e9c6.png)\n\nYou are going to need a friend. I ran out of time to get the AI working. I got 99 problems but an AI isn't one.\n\nBokah is a fight to the death made of pure light. Based on my Bokah. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh) I am incredibly short sighted and the only upside is the pure beauty of lights at night. It is an explosion of colour and pattern. I tried my best to draw it and the game is made entirely of this image. I rekon I got it about 90% accurate. This particular Bokeh is the LED on my power supply which I could study at leasure. Its a pretty vauge thing to try to replicate. I will look at getting variety and movement into a post jam version.\n\nPlayer 1 controls:\nArrows and \"m\" to fire\n\nPlayer 2 controls:\nwasd and \"r\" to fire\n\n![Screenshot (4).png](///raw/68e/c/z/1e9ca.png)\n\nShoot each other to death\n\nDon't go too far from the Rainbow column centre or you will loose life over time.\n\nFire to engage your default stance (Your character will turn red)\n\nOnce you have your stance equipped, your weapon time line will start to move (Regular Bokeh at the side of screen with a moving white Bokeh). Use the rhythm to fire a weapon. Full and half beats count.\n\nIf you miss the beat you will lose 12HP and your stance will turn off. (just the center white Bokeh of your character will be visible).\n\nChange stances by hitting the alternative colours\n\nEach stance has different properties\n\nEvery time you fire you sacrifice 12HP\n\nThe HP 'powers' your weapon. The HP attached to the projectile drops off at a steady rate. Be quick and you can pick it back up (white Bokeh trails). You can collect your enemies HP too! Any HP still attached acts as a damage multiplier when it hits your opponent and as a bonus you get that HP back.\n\n![Screenshot (5).png](///raw/68e/c/z/1e9c8.png)\n\nFind your rhythm, work out your combinations and annihilate the light. Be careful not to be too trigger happy. Sacrifices will be made.\n\nFor all of its faults I am happy with this submission. My first Ludum on a PC, first using a current Unity, first using c#. I got to be creative with Quartz Composer too and look forward to animating an authentic Bokeh or two. I learned a lot and I am definitly much more relaxed about the idea of using c# now as I have been a Unity Script boy up until now.\n\nI had so much I wanted to do but this is as far as I got.

In this game you are going to run a village, where followers of evil cult live. They are peaceful people, who usually develop their village, pray for dark forces and glorify Satan.\n\nBut when peasants attack the village, sectarians have no choise but to offer each other's lives for sacrifice on a sacred altar for summoning the grim hellspawn up for help.\n\nThe game's economy offers several main resources: gold (recruit nomads), food (necessary for hiring new sectarians), wood (building material) and bricks (also building material). Dark Church, which is available from the beginning, lets gathering some gold during exact time (you can see income as green numbers from time to time). \n\nBut your main resource is people. Nevertheless, you must sacrifise them to defence of your village. Therefore, you can turn travellers into your faith at village's reception. For this, click on any nomad, then if you have enough resources, it turns in red robe and starts to believe in... whatever...\n\nIn the beginning of game session you have 5 sectarians, Dark Church and an altar. Besides, there are building fields on a playing area. By selecting a field you can chose a building, which you want to set up: hut, windmill, sawmill and quarry. Huts generates gold, windmills produce food, sawmills give you wood, quarry generates bricks. If task's icon in building menu is grey, it means you do not have enough resources for building.\n\nAfter setting up a building you can appoint there up to 5 sectarians. Running processes from inside increases building's effectivity. Sectarians could be forced to go back outside, for this, select a building and click on sectarians' images in a pop-up interface. \n\nPeasants from a neighbour village will come soon. They will attack sectarians and destroy their houses one by one. Therefore, for defence you must appeal to the altar. You can order sectarians to go there, then you sacrifice their lives. The more blood is spilled, the stronger creature is summoned. Notice, different kinds of demons conquer different kinds of christians with different level of success.\n\nWith every wave of attack your enemies have better chances to win: the amount of their warriors increases, also knights and even inquisitors replace peasants.\n\nHere's the game twitter in case of updates — https://twitter.com/DarkVillagers\n\nHere's gameplay video.\nhttps://youtu.be/vGe6gjNfMhI","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//5b0/f/z/1f533.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/dark-villagers","author":{"name":"AwiX","uid":114729,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//920/c1/z/1a006.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/awix"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//4d3/f/z/1ea49.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//4d3/f/z/1ea49.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://praleks.itch.io/dark-villagers"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"I'M DESPERATE TO KILL THESE BEEZ","category":"jam","description":"YOU DON'T NEED REASONS TO SLAUGHTER EVERY BEEZSZ!\nBUT BE CAREFUL BIZURNURZ, THERE'S A PRICE FOR EVERY MURDER.\n![Capture.PNG](///raw/cab/e1/z/1dbd0.png)\nHere the first game of The Saltiest !

They each have their own magical effect, but no spoiler here, you will have to discover them by yourself.\n\nHere are the basic controls : \n\n- Y, U, I, O, P to throw a BodyPart (Choose wisely!)\n- Arrow Keys to move\n- Mouse to aim your BodyParts Throws.\n\nAlso, we did our best to offer some sounds and music (Hope you will find them entertaining at the very least!)\n\nAny feedback is greatly appreciated !\n\nHave fun :)\n\nBetamorfosis & Vasilievski\n\n![Screenshot1.png](///raw/ae6/b1/z/1d781.png)\n\n![Screenshot2.png](///raw/ae6/b1/z/1d785.png)![Screenshot3.png](///raw/ae6/b1/z/1d786.png)![Screenshot4.png](///raw/ae6/b1/z/1d789.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ae6/b1/z/1d75b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/macrimber-semfice","author":{"name":"Betamorfosis","uid":112362,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/betamorfosis"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ae6/b1/z/1d781.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ae6/b1/z/1d781.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ae6/b1/z/1d785.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ae6/b1/z/1d785.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ae6/b1/z/1d786.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ae6/b1/z/1d786.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ae6/b1/z/1d789.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ae6/b1/z/1d789.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://github.com/DimitriWeb/LudumDare43"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XwlY5rA_ybWQ1CTuprywpbPDFwIW-Tqe"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"UnSHEEPable Sacrifice","category":"jam","description":"It's a game about one sheep.\n\nAuthors: Nelumbo, Clay Fish, UselessDinosaur","thumbnail_url":"","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/unsheepable-sacrifice","author":{"name":"UselessDinosaur","uid":89470,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e7d/51/z/106fb.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/uselessdinosaur"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://veloc1.itch.io/ld43"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"The Chosen Sheep","category":"jam","description":"# Introduction\n\nThe gods have tasked you with controlling the ever increasing sheep population.

The rich sought to correct this by barricading themselves in their ivory towers and making it illegal to be poor.\n\n## The prison system collapsed under the weight of so many residents. The violent, the people with no hope, the poor, flooded back onto the streets. The rich called them hobos, because that's what they were. Hobos.\n\n## Nearly starving to death themselves, the ruling class devised a plan.\n\n## Using the top scientists in the country to build the World's largest Meat Grinder, the rich set about rounding up all the hobos to grind up for food. Thinking this would seem barbaric, they decided to turn it into a spectator sport and allow a hobo selected via lottery the opportunity to move up to the ivory towers.\n\n## Armed with a portal gun, the contestant would battle through hordes of hobos, teleporting them over the World's largest Meat Grinder for the entertainment of the masses. If you could live long enough, all of your dreams of not being a hobo would come true. If not, then you were just food.\n\n## Congratulations. \n\n## You just won the lottery.\n\n\n\n### The future is back! I hope you love arcade games about dystopian worlds in the late 90's, because this this what you're getting in my game. Welcome to Bummed OUT!

Of course, our hero could not stop himself from studying the unknown. And so, he discovered that etherium could behave like a normal physical object, or like an electricity, in some sort of way, and every device powered with this mysterious energy was working far better than before!\n\nBut nothing went unseen for the dimension itself, and it decided to destroy our professor.\n\nIn order to banish the intruders, our pacifistic (and weaponless) professor **will have to sacrifice every single ability he manages to duplicate** from them.\n\nYou are the one, who's gonna help Bambo destroy waves of etherium-possessed enemies using his new etherium shield technology, and you are the one, who will lead the world to technological progress!\n\nP. S. Funnily enough, the only thing that was in common between Etherium and Super Crate Box originally was the overall sub-genre, but the more we delved into the intricate problems of creating an arena battler within harsh time constraints, the more solutions similar to those from SCB emerged: no time to implement real AI? Let's make those enemies cycle through the level; Want more variety and challenge? Add \"berserk\" monster versions. Etc.

This is mostly because the game was built on a game engine I wrote from scratch about a year ago. I certainly had to take a hammer to the engine in order coerce it into running the game. My favorite feature of the engine has to be the log file it will send you when it crashes - please send me that log *when* it crashes, by the way. That said, I am fairly happy with what we ended up with programming wise, all things considered. Unfortunately we didn’t incorporate the theme - it sort of just slipped past us which is most certainly going to hurt our ratings.\n\n# Hatokasai’s note\nI started this jam on little sleep, and I ended the jam with even less. The animations in the game weren’t finished, which you can blame on my lack of experience. The weeks leading up to the jam included trying to clabber a team together, and working on some base sprites so the jam would be easier to complete (Which didn’t help as much as I thought, seeing that I didn’t complete all the animations.)

So this game was real challenge for me as I had only about half a day for the whole game.\n\nThe idea came instantly so I really didn't struggle with this thing. As an art style I use my favourite \"I don't have any god damn time for graphics - art\" and actually I quite like it. I even diceded to make my own sound track and sounds so that was quite fun too. And then programming was pretty easy in comparison with previous project.\n___\n# Final words\nGame is still more demo for concept, because I really didn't have so much time.

Data is consumed with each movement as well.\n\nThe game ends when you lose all of one resource (blue and red bars), or all of your data (green bar), or reach the final data portal.\n\nCareful though, the board updates with each move! The logic for the board updates follows Conway's Game of Life.

You will call the lady in with you and make sweet love to her.  You'll exit the house first, and she will emerge shortly after with a baby in-hand (you have incredibly potent sperm).\n\n**Press J or X** when standing near a lady with a baby to take the baby.  Press J or X again with a baby in-hand to fling the baby.\n\n**SAC BABIES**\n\nFling babies into the beams of light over any 3 altars in the village to sacrifice them.\n\nThe bar on the bottom of the screen runs out over time, and refills whenever you sac a baby.  If it runs out completely, your god will smite you for insufficient sacrifices.  Nail ladies faster!\n\n**SPECTERS**\n\nHowever, *the babies are vengeful*.  The more babies you sacrifice, the more they haunt you.  **Specters of sac'd babies will begin to show up** and throw magic at you, and **it only gets worse the more babies you sac.**\n\nYou get 5 health.  Whenever you take damage or leave a house, you get a second of invulnerability to recover.\n\n**OBJECTIVE**\n\nTry to sac as many babies as you can before dying, whether by specters or judgment from on high!\n\n\n![ld43_screenshot_1.png](///raw/c9a/e1/z/1ee24.png)\n\n![ld43_screenshot_2.png](///raw/c9a/e1/z/1ee25.png)\n\n![ld43_screenshot_3.png](///raw/c9a/e1/z/1ee26.png)\n\n---\n\n**Tips:**\n\n- Dashing (K or C) is super useful and has a very low cooldown.  Use it!\n\n- You can dash in any direction, even straight up when you're on the ground, or straight down when midair.\n\n- Ducking into a house is a good way to protect yourself in a hitch.\n\n- Ladies can't smash with a baby in their arms.  Try to clear babies out of their arms quickly.  There's always an altar nearby!\n\n- Likewise, you can't smash with a baby in your arms.  Don't be afraid to ditch a baby if you need some quick cover, even if you aren't near an altar (it's okay if they hit the ground, just pick them back up later).\n\n- Judgment comes sooner and sooner as you sac babies.\n\n- Move around the whole village; spread the love.  Falling fireballs can be a real problem if you stick in one place too long.\n\n\nMy current high score is 42 babies.  Post yours in the comments!\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n---\n\n*Created with Unity3D, Paint.NET for art, and Bfxr for sound effects.*\n\n---\n\nEDIT: Mac and Linux builds should be available now.

Your ship consists of several blocks in which you can build freely. Each block is responsible for the production of a certain resource. You must give human  sacrifices to maintain the production. \n\nDuring your journey evil gods make your business worse, appearing in divine interferences. During the interferences, gods may require some raw materials from you. \n\nYour goal is to maintain the balance within the ship and reach the finish line.\n\nYou can download the game from here: https://ikturi.itch.io/evil-ship\n\n\n**About the gameplay**\n\nFive blocks can be built in the game, each block produces a different type of resource. To operate a room you need to sacrifice people, the Room block is an exception to this rule. Sacrifice fills resource production to 100% within the block. A status bar shows in the blocks how productive the current block is. Every second, the productivity of the block is reduced, so it has to be filled with people. Various events occur during the game, resulting in increased consumption of certain resource. The upper panel shows the status of consumption/production. The indicator turns to red if the consumption of certain resource more than the production. \nThe exclamation mark shows that the consumption of raw resource a particular block is more than your production.\nAt this point, you need to build additional blocks or fill the existing ones with people to have the right production.\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TD9z5l8r6cY\n\n\n![kep4.png](///raw/341/3/z/1dd77.png)\n\n![kep2.png](///raw/341/3/z/1dd7c.png)\n\n![kep6.png](///raw/341/3/z/1dd80.png)\n\n![kep3.png](///raw/341/3/z/1dd82.png)\n\n\n**Credits**\n\n**Sárkány Zsuzsi** - art (https://www.instagram.com/sarkany.zsuzsa.91/)\n\n**Turi Tamás** - programming\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//341/3/z/1dec6.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/evil-ship","author":{"name":"Tamas Turi","uid":12611,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/tamas-turi"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//341/3/z/1dd77.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//341/3/z/1dd77.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//341/3/z/1dd7c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//341/3/z/1dd7c.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//341/3/z/1dd80.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//341/3/z/1dd80.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//341/3/z/1dd82.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//341/3/z/1dd82.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://ikturi.itch.io/evil-ship"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"A Man and a Dog","category":"jam","description":"![SS5.png](///raw/20d/02/z/1ec15.png)\nYou find yourself stuck in a forest.

I wake up hours later, to the sound of amarillo from me phone, the wife on the line. Singin' their carols at me over the phone they were! Bahh 'umbug I said! She forgot 'er house keys - she slept on em, she said - so she went round her fellow carol singer Barbera`s 'ouse and they 'ad been watching the 'allmark channel til the AM. She wants me to pick 'er up. The lights were out and all, so I forgot all about - that I didn't 'ave me glasses - so I say \"Sure!\", and I 'ang it up sharpish.\n\nNow Im wonderin 'ow am I gunna drive if I don't 'ave me glasses. and the chill in the air.

And dont ask me why but the windows are all wide open! \n\nThen I see in the night a silhouette of my beloved wife, waving and yelling something about the phone call wasn't 'er and she didn't go round Barbera's and they 'adnt watched 'allmark and It was all a pack of lies!\n\nI got me nightgown on, as the chills were downright shockin'! But, when I look back down out the window, the wife wos nowhere to be seen! I swear there was something odd about that night, like a dream or one o' them 'allucinations that scrooge 'ad that night before christmas.\n\nAnd here I am, wondering, did you read this text up to now?

When creating your beam gun, you choose modifications that enhance an offensive ability while sacrificing a defensive ability.\n## Instructions\nBefore starting each arcade _synthrun_, you add modules to your _RAYTAR_ beam gun. Here, the possible module additions display their effect on your stats in the _synthrun_ with a tooltip when the mouse is hovering upon them.\nInside the game, you utilize the beam gun through the following controls:\n- Point in the direction you want to shoot with the mouse\n- Shoot with the left mouse button\n- Run with WASD and arrow buttons\n\n![ezgif.com-optimize (2).gif](///raw/deb/a/z/1dc12.gif)\n\n## Credits\nThe game is developed by [@bo_nyby](https://twitter.com/bo_nyby) and [@esbenkc](https://twitter.com/esbenkc).\n- [FunkyHippo on itch.io](https://funkyhippo.itch.io)\n- [EsbenKC on itch.io](https://esbenkc.itch.io)\n- Music is [Street Dancing](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Timecrawler_82/Osaka_Lights/Street_Dancing) from the album [Osaka Nights](https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Timecrawler_82/Osaka_Lights/) by [TimeCrawler82](https://timecrawler82.wixsite.com/home).\n\n## How to play\nThe game runs in HTML5 on [itch.io](https://esbenkc.itch.io/synthray).\n# Thanks for playing!\n![ezgif.com-optimize.gif](///raw/deb/a/z/1dbfe.gif)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//deb/a/z/1e460.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/synthray","author":{"name":"FunkyHippo","uid":31983,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/funkyhippo"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//deb/a/z/1cbbf.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//deb/a/z/1cbbf.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//deb/a/z/1dc12.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//deb/a/z/1dc12.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//deb/a/z/1dbfe.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//deb/a/z/1dbfe.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://esbenkc.itch.io/synthray"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Cessabit","category":"jam","description":"**_INSTRUCTIONS INSIDE_**\n\n![Overview.png](///raw/d77/21/z/1ea74.png)\n\n*“If you’re going to try, go all the way.

There's a game loop, victory/defeat condition, simple mechanics, physics and collisions, some graphics, and even some (poor) sounds. The idea was based on the theme, although I didn't have much time to realize it in the end. The robot can lose one or two of it's add-on miniguns. Currently, it only restores some health, but the original idea was make a larger level where the player has to control the robot deeper into ever-narrowing corridors and the only way to proceed would have been to ditch guns and other equipment to fit there.\n\n--\n\nThe game was made using Godot running on a Linux. I did all the arts and coding myself. Graphics were primarily created with Inkscape as vector graphics and then exported into png. Some graphics (like the background) were done with Gimp. The graphic texts were made with a super-easy online tool, as there was no time anymore to make them by hand. Yet they're probably the best graphics in the game :stuck_out_tongue: Sounds were hastily done with SFXR. There's no music, although I would've loved to create something. Probably would have used LMMS for that.\n\n--\n\nOverall, it was very nice to work on the game, and learned little bit more again about Godot.

Hope more people will play and rate the game. \n\nUpdate: Thanks for the patience, I have uploaded the game on itch.io, where you can play the game without downloading it(If that's not working, consider downloading it).","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//57c/02/z/1dad8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/our-sacrifice","author":{"name":"Keshav Sharma","uid":134261,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/keshav-sharma"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//57c/02/z/1dae6.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//57c/02/z/1dae6.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://jmp.sh/Hr2x1Z9"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://jmp.sh/CDdWkOE"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://keshav9999.itch.io/our-sacrifi"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Transmute Your Villagers TD","category":"jam","description":"\n\nWelcome to Transmute Your Villagers TD !\n\nIn this tower defense you will use your own villagers as money to upgrade your towers in order to save the village.\n\n#### How to play\n\nTower Defense part\n\n![tuto_1.png](///raw/d24/31/z/1db30.png)\n\n\nVillage management part\n![tuto_2.png](///raw/d24/31/z/1db3f.png)\n\n\n#### Team\n* [Keithdae](https://ldjam.com/users/keithdae/) (programming)\n* [Sabeurre](https://ldjam.com/users/sabeurre/) (programming, graphics)\n\n#### Tools\n* Unity\n* MagicaVoxel for all models\n* https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page for the icons\n* https://opengameart.org/ for the music","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d24/31/z/1dac7.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/transmute-your-villagers-td","author":{"name":"Sabeurre","uid":78893,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d24/31/z/1eca6.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/sabeurre"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d24/31/z/1db30.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d24/31/z/1db30.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d24/31/z/1db3f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d24/31/z/1db3f.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://git.konosprod.fr/Konosprod/LD-43"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://sabeurre.itch.io/transmute-your-villagers-td"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://sabeurre.itch.io/transmute-your-villagers-td"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Trench","category":"jam","description":"![trench banner.PNG](///raw/2ed/71/z/1dcb2.png)\n\nWith the 100th aniversary of the WW1 last month, we decided to make a game about trench war where you need to manage an army in a trench battle.\n![Capture1.PNG](///raw/2ed/71/z/1d917.png)\n\nSome gameplay footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBfYWR3Slx4\n\nThe game was made with Unity, it was my second game jam (VIBROMATIC) and the first for Mesca.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2ed/71/z/1d8e3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/trench","author":{"name":"VIBROMATIC","uid":97762,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/vibromatic"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2ed/71/z/1dcb2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2ed/71/z/1dcb2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2ed/71/z/1d917.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2ed/71/z/1d917.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://lagache-louis.itch.io/trench"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://lagache-louis.itch.io/trench"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"The Cult","category":"jam","description":"## The cult requires sacrifices\n\nYou must provide those sacrifices.

You will have to\ncut them open and do some organ transplants. To open up a patient, you will\nhave to cut along a marked line on their body in order to not damage any organs.\nTo transplant the organ itself, just drag it over to its new spot and connect\nthe blood vessels. Be careful to connect arteries to arteries and veins to veins!\n\n![promo003.png](///raw/11a/z/1d5ab.png)\n\nThere's also the possibility of - ahem - 'acquiring' and 'disposing' of organs\nthrough other means.\n\nOnce you are done with a patient, a press of the green button will send them to\nthe recovery room and bring in the next patient. Coincidentally, there is also\nan incinerator below (the hospital was built over a steel mill), but I don't\nsee how you could use it.\n\n![promo002.png](///raw/11a/z/1d5b5.png)\n\n## How to start\nIn the main menu press one of the green buttons to start the game. If you click on the scalpel there will be a tutorial.\n\n![promo000.png](///raw/11a/z/1d5b8.png)\n\n## Leader board\nCan you beat the high score?

The magic used was contained within an amulet that has been lost in antiquity - until now.\n\n  You are a practicing blood mage who draws power from Balthazar through the performance of human sacrifice. Your greatest desire is to free your master from his prison. You have discovered the location of the Amulet of Yendor and now descend into the depths of Balthazar's fortress where the amulet has remained since its use to imprison him. You have collected some sacrifices to take into the pit with you. Recover it and return to release your Great Master from his prison.\n\n  Maybe he will be eternally grateful...\n\n## Notes\n\n  The game is what you would typically expect from a rogue-like. However, due to the time limit, there is only one spell and no additional weapons or armor. You will get hungry and need food and potions are randomized each playthrough, so keep track!\n\n  Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to add sound effects.\n\n## Theme\n\n  As usual, we hated the theme when it was first announced, but we quickly came up with the idea for this game. The game is full of sacrifices, and we had to make many to create it!\n\n  First, inventory space is limited, and you cannot drop anything! So, choose carefully what you pick up. Second, while you are not limited on how many sacrifices you can have with you, you will harm them if you step on them, so, again, choose wisely. Finally, you have the obvious use of sacrifices at altars to add mana.\n\n## Areas of responsibility\n\n**James:** All coding\n\n**Anthony:** Graphics\n\n**Cameron:** Graphics and Music\n\n## Tools Used\n\nUnity 2018.2.3f1 (I was having a lot of issues with the most recent version for some reason)\n\nGIMP\n\nBosca Ceoil\n\n## WebGL\n\n  We usually provide a WebGL version of our entry. However, this time around, we have not yet as it would require some refactoring since we use multi-threading to generate the levels and that cannot be done with a WebGL build. We may provide one after submission if we can find the time.\n\n## Thanks for playing and rating!\n\n  We hope you enjoy our entry to our sixth consecutive Ludum Dare as much as we enjoyed making it, and we look forward to LD44 (after a well deserved break, of course.)\n\n![Cultist's Quest 0.1rc Screenshot 2018.12.03 - 18.46.28.91.png](///raw/158/2/z/1daf7.png)\n\n![Cultist's Quest 0.1rc Screenshot 2018.12.03 - 18.47.43.87.png](///raw/158/2/z/1db00.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//158/2/z/1caaa.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/cultists-quest","author":{"name":"James Dunlap","uid":10321,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//158/2/z/3beb.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/james-dunlap"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//158/2/z/1daf7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//158/2/z/1daf7.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//158/2/z/1db00.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//158/2/z/1db00.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://lonewolfstudios.org/ld43/Win64.zip"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://lonewolfstudios.org/ld43/Win32.zip"},{"label":"macOS","url":"http://lonewolfstudios.org/ld43/MacOSX.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://lonewolfstudios.org/ld43/Linux.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"They're 'armless","category":"jam","description":"You are a contestant in a new blood sport, the rules are that you can only attack the opposition by throwing yours, and their, limbs at them.

I ended up making the bare minimum but I'm still proud of implementing everything like selecting multiple units from scratch. Hope you have fun.\n\nCONTROLS: \n- drag left/ right mouse: select single or multiple units\n- click left mouse: move to location\n- click right mouse: move to location but if enemy is in range attack\n- if a unit is attacked it will automatically fight back\n-'R' to reset during game ( because the genes are random, bad luck can give you a very bad starting position)\n\nGOAL: \n- the 'pits' in the left bottom and top right corner can  be used to kill off units but you can't fall into the oponents pit\n- the numbers on top of the units represent their attack power\n- the longer a unit lives the more its 'genes' will affect the next spawned unit's attack power\n- the number inside the pit represents the 'average attack power of the gene pool': simply said the higher this number the more chance of the next unit having a high attack\n\nMore explicitly: the 'average attack power, is determined by multiplying each units attack power by the time it is living and adding these together and dividing by the total time lived. Also a number of dead units are still taken into account, with the time they had lived. So in a formula av=sum(A_i*t_i)/sum(t_i) with A_i and t_i the attack power and time alive of unit i. \nThe next spawning unit is determined as a combination of two units plus some mutation chance. The longer a unit has lived the more chances it had to 'mate' and the more chance it will have to be a 'parent' of the newly spawned unit. \n\n\n\nWIN: \n- be genetically superior, the average attack power of your gene pool should be 25 higher than the enemy's gene pool\n- have at least five living units\n\nPlease give me some much needed feedback !

Fly through space toward the Warp Gate, stopping along the way to gather Space-Seeds. You can turn in these seeds at various Bird Stations to upgrade your stats.\n\n*Hint: Upgrading your boost also increases your base speed.* \n\nWith this Ludum Dare submission, we wanted to emphasize player input and controls while navigating 3D space. We hope that you are able to have fun just flying around and messing with our unique yet basic control system.\n\n### Programming: James Tusha (http://www.twitter.com/PopDaddyGames)\n\n### SFX & Music: Joshua Damian (http://www.twitter.com/AtmcType\n\n### Art & Models: Anthony Tusha \n\nNote: The bird currently implemented in this build is an asset purchased from the Unity Asset Store- we were not able to complete the rigging process for our own bird during the jam. We will be adding our bird at a later date.

We put about 7 hours of development time into the core concepts prior to the jam (not knowing what the theme would be) because all three of us had work and real life events we had to partake in over the course of the jam. James did about 50 hours of programming, Anthony about 30 hours of modeling, and Josha bout 20 hours of audio / music 'for this jam'. While we wanted to participate wholly in the jam experience, we simply could not afford the time this particular weekend. We still had a blast, and hope you enjoy what we were able to come up with!\n\n** _ P.S. You can enter a \"Cheats\" menu by holding \"Q\" and \"W\" at the same time.

The game has been made to be played with a controller but you can still play it with a keyboard, the binds are listed at the end of this text.\n\n![unknown (2).png](///raw/5b7/d1/z/1da90.png)\n\nThis is the first time we're making a game and we're honestly very proud of it, it makes us happy considering the fact that we were a team of 3 which was very unexperienced in the game development domain.\nOur team consisted of Dumbeldor (programmer), Emeffe (programmer), and Pokang (beginner artist)!\nWe all learnt how to use Unreal Engine on the run and we learnt a whole lot during this jam, working in a restricted environment really brings up the best out of a learning experience.\nWe didn't sleep a lot and we worked super hard to bring a decent game for you guys and for ourselves, and we're very satisfied with what we made, we hope you will enjoy it!\nEverything happened super fast and we weren't seeing time passing by!\n\n\nNow that I've shortly introduced our game and team I will enter in the more technical details for those interested.\n\nTo make this game, we've used these resources : \n\n\t-Unreal Engine 4\n\t-MagicaVoxel (thank you ephtracy ily so much?)\n\t-Mixamo\n\t-Photoshop\n\t-Audacity\n\t-LMMS\n\t-GitHub\n\nAbout the assets, every voxel asset has been made by Pokang on MagicaVoxel and he's super thankful for ephtracy who made such an intuitive and beautiful software to use.\nWe've chosen to use Mixamo for rigging and animations because it makes decent, fast and cool animations, that can be a little goofy sometimes, which we enjoy!\nWe've used Photoshop for a few UI assets, and all the sound effects have been recorded by Pokang and his scuffed mic with various objects around his apartment.\nThe super short music loop has been made by Pokang on LMMS, he's never really made music before so the track is very simple, we didn't want to have a near to silent world and we didn't want to use other's people assets!\nAll the rest has been made by our super cool programmers who have made an crazy job at learning UE4 along their path to enlightment and who learnt a whole lot of cool things during the development of the game.\nWe're impressed at how many things we've come to acheive during the 72 hours of the jam and these things include : \n\n\t-A cool main menu\n\t-A lot of animations for characters\n\t-A fighting system\n\t-An equipment system with items you can drop when needed\n\t-A dialog system which brings a story we entirely wrote and imagined from scratch\n\t-Crouching, jumping, movement features\n\t-A platformer part\n\t-A healing system\n\t-A very short cinematic\n\t-A checkpoint system\n\t-Very mean enemies that attack you just for the sake of it\n\t-Credits!\n\t-An excessive theine consumption by the team\n\n![Capture.PNG](///raw/5b7/d1/z/1ddec.png)\n\n![unknown.png](///raw/5b7/d1/z/1d9f3.png)\n\nNow to give a little background about where this all started, Dumbeldor and Emeffe are both students and friends in the same class, and Dumbeldor met Pokang during another project which is called Skyrim Together, a Skyrim mod that has the objective of bringing multiplayer and coop to Skyrim.\n\nFeel free to tell us your honest opinion about our game, we'd love to hear it even if it's not positive!\n\nWe're looking forward to playing all of your awesome submissions guys, I've personally noted some of them that I REALLY want to play.\n\n![unknown (1).png](///raw/5b7/d1/z/1da94.png)\n\nThank you Ludum Dare to give us this wonderful opportunity to train ourselves and create cool stuff, we enjoyed this event so much as a

When you're done you give it to the customer, and the next guy in line walks up. When all customers are gone, you can spend your hard earned money on new ingredients.\n\n\nFor those interested, the original idea was to have purchasable upgrades, such as a less-rusty (or not rusty at all) counter. The original ice booth, is actually a hot dog stand, with the writing \"Joe's Sausages\" on it, which you were then supposed to 'upgrade' by removing the old branding (And the hotdog on the roof). These \"upgrades\" was intended as motivation for saving up money, as well as the ability to upgrade your equipment. Upgrades could also increase the appeal of your ice cream stand, thus resulting in more customers. Factors like hygiene were also thought as factors, that could affect the amount of customers generated. Other than that, we would also have liked to have done some voice acting, but due to poor management of time, and the late start, we simply ran out of time, and didn't get around to it.\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e92/z/1d9d7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/sacrifs-ice","author":{"name":"Mekuri","uid":670,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/mekuri"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VejQUanZqPJ-ATht4gFV1wsJr9Mo-k7D/view?usp=sharing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"dungeon and death","category":"jam","description":"\nThis is a Dungeon Crawler where you have to balance food and your companions\n\n![asd.png](///raw/2ba/31/z/1d451.png)![l;kl;.png](///raw/2ba/31/z/1d453.png)![qasd.png](///raw/2ba/31/z/1d454.png)![sdasd.png](///raw/2ba/31/z/1d457.png)![unknown.png](///raw/2ba/31/z/1d459.png)\n\n__How to play:__\n- you have 3 companions a mage(blue), a healer(yellow) and a archer(green)\n- these companions lose food over time but you will find chicken in the dungeon when you pick it up you can feed 1 of your companions \n- press 1 to feed the mage 2 for the healer and 3 for the archer\n- when the food reaches 0 your companion dies\n- the archer and mage deal ranged damage to enemies\n- there are 2 types of enemies skeleton and warlock \n- the archer does more damage to the skeleton\n- the mage does more damage to the warlock \n- the healer heals you \n- you walk with W and S and you turn with A and D\n- you can hit enemies if they are close to you with control\n- if you see purple smoke that is a teleport it will teleport you to the next location.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2ba/31/z/1d446.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/dungeon-and-death","author":{"name":"Glorious Kittens","uid":80562,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/glorious-kittens"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2ba/31/z/1d451.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2ba/31/z/1d451.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2ba/31/z/1d453.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2ba/31/z/1d453.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2ba/31/z/1d454.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2ba/31/z/1d454.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2ba/31/z/1d457.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2ba/31/z/1d457.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2ba/31/z/1d459.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2ba/31/z/1d459.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/file/apm6al8c33j2833/dungeons%2526death.rar/file"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"ALL HE CAN EAT","category":"jam","description":"The holy JumJum wants sacrifices.

together with the frustrations of allosexuals (\"normal sexuals\") that require or expect physical intimacy to build more emotional attachment in the first place. \n\nHow to Play\n---------\nObject of the game is to achieve a mutual, consensual relationship that is both emotionally and physically rewarding. \n\nYou can sacrifice some of your physical or emotional integrity in order to save your relationship in this game. This can go terribly wrong but sometimes buys you the time you need. \n\nYou may also sacrifice a friendship or two for the sake of love if you are metal enough. \n\nIf you don't like your character, restart the game.

Weakening a category 5 times will grand you a special move, and downgrading it 10 times (which is max) will give you a respective super power!\n\n### Categories:\n\n> Movementspeed -> Dash (Shift) -> Superdash (Rightclick + Shift)  \n> Health -> Revive -> Super rage mode on death  \n> Vision -> Always see zombiesouls -> Become invisible for a few seconds (STRG)  \n> Damage -> Fireball (E) -> Stun and damage every zombie (Rightclick + E)  \n> Attackspeed -> Pierce through enemys -> Become a rapidfire turret for a few seconds (ALT)  \n\n### Keybindings:\n\n> Aim with your mouse  \n> W+A+S+D to move  \n> Space to jump  \n> Respective keys for the abilities (Shown above) \n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nMake sure to play in FullHD (1920 / 1080) or something close to 16:9 otherwise the UI won't get scaled properly, because who needs dynamic UIs?  \nAlso we have compiled a Linux Version but not tested it at all (my Arch died once again :sob: ), so that one might work fine, or not at all ...  \nFor the best experience download the game, otherwise you can also play it in your webbrowser.  \n\n# BUT NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING!

While not letting it destroy yours.\n\nTo do this you have to play cards. The price of playing a card it in the top-right.\n\nOnce on the table you can activate Card ability (middle section). Which has a cost as well (middle-left). The effect of the ability would be either dealing damage to enemy cards or box (arrowhead) or heal your cards/box.\n\nIf you attack enemy card the color of your attacking ability must match the color of cards health (top-left).\n\nIf enemy card shows its hearth as a shield - this is a defender. Any attacks of this colot must hit one of the defenders.\n\nAttacks of any color can be used to target enemy box.\n\nTo play cards or use abilities you need to spend mana, which is earned by sacrificing your cards to the fiery pit on the left. The amount of mana gained is listed at the bottom of the card. But be cautious - all unused mana will burn your health.\n\nAt the beginning of each turn you are dealt enough cards to have 6 in your hand.\n\nEnemy cards don't use mana. Instead they activate on timers. At the bottom left you can see number of tuns befor the card acts again.\n\nIf any details are hard to see - Right-click on a card (yours or enemy) to look closed. (Though please don't move mouse while you expecting).\n\nAll this might sound a bit convoluted, but I just guess this is how boardgames are.\n\nAnd speacking of sounds - there are none. Sorry. I know this would have added so much to the feel of the game, but I am still not good with them.\n\nHave fun!\n\nPS: If you are unlucky with cards the game might be brutal.

Your objective is to simply not die for 10 minutes.

Ranged attacks do not stun.\n* Every item has throw damage, except for the bandage. Throw damage on melee weapons is weaker than it's melee damage. Throw damage is equal on guns. The kunai is an exception, being a melee weapon with higher throw damage than melee damage.\n* Throwing items stuns longer than melee attacks, but the stun duration is also dependent on each item. The bandage despite not doing damage, stuns for as long as the stick and the rock.\n* Machine enemies spawn every minute, on the minute. They have much more health than any other enemy, and drop the strongest weapons.

In their hunger for wealth and power they caused the demise of mankind. At the brink of a complete extinction, only a small village escaped the eyes of the gods, until now.\nBaring the legacy of mankind, it is up to you to aid the small mountain town of Javalonia to please the celestial beings while slowly increasing its population. How long will you last before you too perish?\n\n\n*** For those who do not want to read the entire manual *** : This game is a resource gathering game in the shape of a very minimalistic RTS. The gods will ask you for resources, if you can't comply they will kill your villagers until you sacrifice one to them instead.\n\n## Manual\n\n___\n\n#### CONTROLS\n___\n\n\n\nKey | Action\n--- | --- \nF1 | Show controls overlay\nLeft Click| Select a single unit, confirm position to move to  \nRight Click & Drag | Select multiple units\nTab | Toggle minimap\nArrow Keys| Move camera\nLeft CTRL + UP/DOWN keys| Follow a villager\n\n___\n\n#### The World\n\n___\n\nRight click on a villager to select him/her. Alternatively you can left click and drag (see image). Then proceed doing the same on a target and select an action. Note that not everything can be farmed, as the Gods do not want you to mess with live trees. \n\n |  |  |  |  |  | \n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n![tree.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1d8b5.png) | wood  | ![berries.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1d8f5.png) | food | ![water.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1d8c8.png)| water \n![rock.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1d8c3.png) | stone | ![wheat.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1d8ed.png)| food | \n\n\n___\n\n#### Villager actions\n\n___\n\nA villager can do multiple things. They have to, the fate of mankind depends on it !!!! To aid you in keeping track of your villagers, you can hold down *** CTRL and the up or down arrow keys ***. This will make the camera follow an individual villager in its endeavour! You can also toggle a minimap using the *** TAB *** key\n\n___\n\n##### Sacrifice\n\n___\n\nYou can sacrifice a villager , should the gods demand so. Or if you are unable to fulfill one of their wishes. By right clicking a villager and selecting sacrifice, the character will find its path back to the altar at the village square.\nVillagers are really your most precious resource however, so be careful ! \n\n                             _Making a sacrifice_\n![sacrifice-small.gif](///raw/12b/31/z/1d995.gif)\n\n\n___\n\n##### Harvest\n\n___\n\n\nYou can manually specify a resource that should be harvested by a villager. Select one or multiple villagers, then right click your target and select \"Harvest\". Obtaining food is harder than it seems. Berries can be quite rare and the only other option is to tend to the farmland near the village. You can use water to let the crops grow, which can then be harvested for food ! Right click the farmland and water it.\n\n                             _Harvesting a tree_\n![action_smaller.gif](///raw/12b/31/z/1d873.gif)\n\n___\n\n##### Scavenge\n\n___\n\nWhen you are in sudden need of a certain resource, you don't always have the time to manage every target for a villager manually. By selecting \"Scavenge\" you can set a resource type and let the AI handle the gathering for you ! Easy peasy !\n\n___\n\n##### Rest\n\n___\n\nVillagers are also a resource and you will run out if the divine demands keep coming. In order to reproduce, at least *** 2 villagers *** need to be resting in the same house. You can do this by selecting villagers, right clicking a house and selecting rest. If you have ***  at least 50 of each resource *** , there is a chance the villagers will reproduce !\n\n                             _Resting and reproducing_\n![drag_select_smaller.gif](///raw/12b/31/z/1d949.gif)\n\n\n___\n\n##### Notifications\n___\n\nA villager will let you know what it is up to by means of a text bubble. \n\n\nObject| Type \n--- | --- \n![StatusIcons_Animation 1_00.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f465.png) | found what I was looking for | ![StatusIcons_Animation 1_06.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f46b.png) | confused, did you interrupt me?     \n![StatusIcons_Animation 1_01.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f466.png) | brought something to the village |  ![StatusIcons_Animation 1_07.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f46c.png) | looking for wood\n![StatusIcons_Animation 1_02.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f467.png) | can't reach what you want me to | ![StatusIcons_Animation 1_08.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f46d.png) | looking for food  \n![StatusIcons_Animation 1_03.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f468.png) | there is no resource nearby | ![StatusIcons_Animation 1_09.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f46e.png) | looking for water \n![StatusIcons_Animation 1_04.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f469.png) | thinking about what I need to do | ![StatusIcons_Animation 1_10.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f46f.png) | looking for gold\n![StatusIcons_Animation 1_05.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f46a.png) | sick, something went wrong | \n\n___\n\n#### Events\n\n___\n\n##### Rewards\n\n___\n\n![idol.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1d952.png)\n\nThe Gods will bestow you with fortune or will demand sacrifices to be made. In the former, an idol will spawn on the map. Have one of your villagers obtain it before time runs out and you will be rewarded with a random resource ! \n\n___\n\n##### Punishments \n\n___\n\nYou are a toy. The Gods will put you in place with plagues and disaster. You can bribe them by following their demands, by clicking the appropriate button in the HUD (if you have the resources). Be sure to do so before the pentagon timer runs out, the consequences might be severe...\n\n![hud.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1d98f.png)\n\nPlague| Flood | Earthquake\n--- | --- | ---\n![flies_smaller.gif](///raw/12b/31/z/1d9ef.gif) | ![flood-resize.gif](///raw/12b/31/z/1d9f4.gif) | ![quake-smaller.gif](///raw/12b/31/z/1da01.gif)\n\n___\n\n\n## Special Features\n\n___\n\n### Procedural Audio\n\n___\n\nThe audio for this game is procedural. It is generated on the spot and to prove that, there is a function in the options window that can swap between the generated music and piano music on the fly !\n\n___\n\n### Automated resource gathering state machine\n\n___\n\nI've spent almost a full day on this and it still is not working as well as I want it to. It is surprisingly difficult to instruct an AI to be confused at times !\n\n___\n\n### Pixel art\n\n___\n\nAll pixel art was created by me using only 3 gray tones from the Arne64's preset in Pyxel Edit !\n\n___\n\n## Used Software \n\n___\n\n* Audacity\n* Pxyel Edit\n* Unity2018.2.15f1 and Visual Studio 2017\n* sfbgames.com/chiptone/\n\n___\n\n## Developer's note\n\n___\n![drjavasaurus.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1da91.png)\n\n\nI have been doing game development as a hobby for the last two years now. I am not a \"project finisher\", but I am an avid prototyper. I wanted to take the challenge and put as much in this game as I could, using a slice of my skills to deliver the best I could in 2 days. I had tremendous fun writing an overly complex game with simple gameplay mechanics. In a way, I created a chainsaw to carve a chicken, breaking the code more than I fixed it. Resource gathering AI and procedural music in 2 days, with loads of side challenges (drag select, delegate events, ... )\n\nThank you for reading this page, that in itself is appreciation! \n\nThank you for the Ludum Dare community. Every issue is a blast ! And I would also like to thank the Twitch community for the fun streams, even early in the morning. Mic-less mind you, as I did not want to wake my son with my crazyness. Yet you guys stuck by my side and cheered me on ! \n\nAlso thanks for the streams that motivated me and helped me finish the project with laughs and enjoyment.\n\n*** https://www.twitch.tv/honestdangames ***\n\n*** https://www.twitch.tv/rocknightstudios ***\n\n*** https://www.twitch.tv/akouo_studios ***\n\n*** https://www.twitch.tv/instafluff ***\n\n*** https://www.twitch.tv/wobblytrout ***\n\n*** https://www.twitch.tv/krassenstein ***\n\n\nUntill next edition, you can find me at *** _https://www.twitch.tv/DrJavaSaurus_ *** !\n\n___\n\n                            Thank you for your time and effort playing the game.

On the way to your finish you have to solve various puzzles and overcome dangerous obstacles by sacrificing various parts of your zombie body.\n\n## How to Play\nTo get to the end of the level you have to use your body parts wisely. Every part can be used just once and has a different kind of skillset you can make use of:\n- **1 Head**: Throw in flat gaps you cant enter (Key 5 and then Q)\n- **1 Arm**: Throw as a spear to climb walls (Key 2 and then Q)\n- **2 Legs**: Dig a hole (Key 3 or 4 then W,W) or leverage stones (Key 3 or 4 then Q)\n- **1 Eye**: Throw in small gaps (Key 6 then Q)\n\n![zombietutorial.png](///raw/636/e1/z/1d6e7.png)\n\nSacrificing parts of your body also makes you smaller which allows you to enter parts of a stage you can't reach as a whole zombie. You can press buttons with any part that can reach the designated button.\n\n\n## Screenshots\n![screen1.png](///raw/636/e1/z/1d726.png)\nJust managed to solve a puzzle with a stone\n\n![screen.png](///raw/636/e1/z/1d722.png)\nUsing head to manage the next obstacle\n\n![screen2.png](///raw/636/e1/z/1d724.png)\nAbout to win the final stage\n\n## Insight\nThis game was built in Unity2D. It is coded in C# by using Visual Studio. The Graphics are made in Gimp from scratch. \n\n## Theme\nWhen thinking about \"Sacrifices Must Be Made\" we thought about sacrifices oneself has to do and not about sacrificing someone else. We built the game around funny mechanics to make this dark sounding theme more joyful.\n\n### Status\nThe game has currently two stages, which have to be completed in the same run. Every implemented mechanic has some use case. It's developed in a way, to which new mechanics and stages can be added easily in the future.\n\n### Credits\nEverything that belongs to the category \"Audio\" is free-to-use Data, credit goes to: \n- FreqMan: https://freesound.org/people/FreqMan/sounds/25847/\n- soundmary: https://freesound.org/people/soundmary/sounds/117628/\n- Robinhood76: https://freesound.org/people/Robinhood76/sounds/187632/\n- Replix: https://freesound.org/people/Replix/sounds/173126/\n- Music: https://www.purple-planet.com Electro Zombie\n- chripei: https://freesound.org/people/chripei/sounds/165491/\n- sjnewton: https://freesound.org/people/sjnewton/sounds/256566/","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//636/e1/z/1d5a2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/rip-apart","author":{"name":"muzigpuzig","uid":55761,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/muzigpuzig"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//636/e1/z/1d6e7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//636/e1/z/1d6e7.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//636/e1/z/1d726.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//636/e1/z/1d726.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//636/e1/z/1d722.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//636/e1/z/1d722.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//636/e1/z/1d724.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//636/e1/z/1d724.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://muzaker.itch.io/rip-apart"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/13MDS6vC96WRPEXlJMDZV0gjJFY9Hk3GP/view?usp=sharing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Sacrificial Platformer","category":"jam","description":"A 2D platformer where you must sacrifice a gameplay mechanic or engine feature each time you finish both levels.

I decided to learn a new framework during the compo, which I know is an awful idea, and of course I paid the price by spending most of Saturday futilely working on math and basic camera functionality.\n\nOn the plus side, now I have experience with PIXI.js.  I implemented a very basic board/card game framework and put in some basic game rules.\n\nAs uploaded, this is a tiny proof of concept of a board/card game idea.  The general concept is of a board game where you may have various strategic paths and options, but periodically rather than only other players blocking you, you are forced to sacrifice an element of the game.\n\n# Opinions Wanted\n\nSince this is such a limited prototype, high ratings are neither expected nor my goal.  However, I would greatly appreciate if you have any feedback on whether an expanded version of this concept might interest you at all, whether in digital or physical form.  If I do more experimentation on the concept, I may also update the art and put a version up on Tabletop Simulator for playtesting.\n\nIn general, my ideas for a full version of the game could include concepts such as:\n\n* More players (e.g. 4)\n* More stats/resources (e.g. alms, wheat, bread, food, candles, ink, manuscripts, robes, medicine)\n* More strategic options (e.g. cards that can be drawn / purchased / drafted)\n* More replay value (e.g. different cards / goals / buildings selected each game)\n* More interactions (e.g. trading alms for holiness)\n* More locations and actions inside the monastery (e.g. carpentry, masonry, gardening, tailoring, cleaning, eating, praying, reading/writing, teaching, performing music, nursing)\n* Options outside the monastery (e.g. begging, preaching, visiting, selling, fishing)\n* Jobs that could be earned based on stats/resources or affect gameplay (e.g. abbot, prior, lector, cantor)\n* More sacrifice options (e.g. sacrificing an entire card, or giving up a stat like reputation entirely, or restricting movement in some other way such as if the garden was more of a universal path between buildings)\n\nYou're also welcome to speak up if you think it's a terrible idea!  It helps either way.  :)\n\n# Game Rules\n\nMonastico is a board/card game for 2 players.  You can also click \"Start AI\" at any time to let a bot play as your opponent.  It should work on mobile phones, except for zooming. \n\nEach player is a monk performing various tasks in a monastery.  Currently, the monastery only contains a library, kitchen, dormitory, garden, and chapel.  As the seasons change, you must sacrifice even more worldly tasks in order to be more monk-like.\n\nA randomly selected player takes their turn first.  All players start with 5 HP.\n\nOn your turn, you must either move to a new building or lose 1 holiness to pass your turn and be idle.  You cannot pass if you have 0 holiness.  Movement is either clockwise or counterclockwise, and if the next building is completely full, you can skip over it.  When you land on a building space, you perform its action.\n\nAfter every 5 turns, which means 2 for 1 player and 3 for the other, the season will change.  To start the new season, each player must choose something to sacrifice.  For the first season change, either clockwise or counterclockwise movement must be sacrificed.  For the next two season changes, building spaces must be sacrificed.\n\nIf you move to a building space that you sacrificed, the effect does not occur, and you can move again on the same turn.\n\nAfter 20 turns, which means 4 seasons, the game ends.  The player with the most HP + learning + holiness + reputation wins.  Otherwise, there is a tie.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//bc2/1/z/1ce61.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/monastico-ld43-entry","author":{"name":"gafblizzard","uid":4811,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/gafblizzard"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://gafblizzard.github.io/bliz-ld43/index.html"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Story Simulator","category":"jam","description":"Haven’t you always been wondering how your life could change if you would set different priorities?\nYou would have to sacrifice your time for different tasks but it could have a huge impact… For the better or for the worse.

But think carefully before you do anything!  Your two most important resources, fuel and oxygen, are limited! Take too long and you'll suffocate, but jump too often and you may find yourself stranded. Fortunately for you, this planet seems to have these little orbs of energy, that give you a little bit more oxygen  in your reserves, so it's not all doom and gloom!\n\nYour scoring for each level is based on how much time you have remaining until you run out of oxygen by the time you land inside the teleporter. So, do you sacrifice a few extra jumps to give yourself a faster route to the teleporter, or do you take the safer route you know will have you clear the level, but at the cost of a better score.

When you release the mouse, the astronaut will shoot off in the opposite direction you dragged in, like a cosmic slingshot!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/a5xjU8o\n\nThat's all you need to know, but you make want to know that you can quickly restart any level by pressing R, and you can also return to the level select screen from any level by pressing L.\n\nCredits\n\nArt & Animation: Ayo Norman-Williams\n\nScripting, Sound, & Implementation: Thomas Robson\n\nMusic & Game Concept: Dalvia Dhillon","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//39e/d/z/1d6a8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/space-hopper","author":{"name":"Tom Robson","uid":56979,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//39e/d/z/fcb0.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/tom-robson"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//39e/d/z/1d6c0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//39e/d/z/1d6c0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//39e/d/z/1d6c4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//39e/d/z/1d6c4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://tomrobson.itch.io/space-hopper"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://tomrobson.itch.io/space-hopper"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://tomrobson.itch.io/space-hopper"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://tomrobson.itch.io/space-hopper"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Castle Defense","category":"jam","description":"Castle Defense is a game forged out of the deep deep depths of my mind...\n\nHi there,\n\nIf you are reading this I would like to thank you for taking the time to review and rate my game.\n\nWHAT:\n---------------\nWell you may ask what this game is all about and it is simple, defense.\nThe main goal of this game is to defend your castle, build some defense towers, sacrifice some minions while building towers and of course to have some fun.\n\nHOW:\n---------------\nIt is simple, download the link below which is a zip file, extract its content and then run the game.\nTo play just drag the available units to a green open tile on the screen and upgrade where you can.\nDefend your castle against the daemon rage.\n\nAll instructions is in the game.\n\nRemember just enjoy and have fun.\n\nHere is some eye candy for those that can't wait.\n\n![screenshot-011.jpg](///raw/0ca/z/1d6aa.jpg)\n\n![screenshot-012.jpg](///raw/0ca/z/1d6ab.jpg)\n\n![screenshot-013.jpg](///raw/0ca/z/1d6ae.jpg)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0ca/z/1d6b0.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/castle-defense","author":{"name":"tgiant","uid":2752,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0ca/z/f296.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/tgiant"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0ca/z/1d6aa.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0ca/z/1d6aa.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0ca/z/1d6ab.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0ca/z/1d6ab.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0ca/z/1d6ae.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0ca/z/1d6ae.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vnGnTBabJ9_67ZqUpB8E2NFSzOFOtwsP/view?usp=sharing"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vnGnTBabJ9_67ZqUpB8E2NFSzOFOtwsP/view?usp=sharing"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vnGnTBabJ9_67ZqUpB8E2NFSzOFOtwsP/view?usp=sharing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Supermarket Heroes","category":"jam","description":"Pick one of the three available RPG characters and fight against your friends in this local multiplayer game!

Patrolling the icy wastes you come across a camp of people, and due to your natural charisma, you soon become the leader. Take charge in this life or death situation, utilising special individuals skills in order to survive. But you'll have to sacrifice others in order for the whole colony to survive, who will you pick? Will this freeze ever end, and if it does will you and your colonists be there to see it?\n\nThis is our 5th entry into Ludum Dare, and we may have been a bit over ambitious with the scope of the game and what we wanted to achieve. What we have now is a great base to build off, and to make an actual game from, but we hope you enjoy what we managed to make in the 3 days! Things like the build menu and scavenging we would of built more on if we had the time, however this is definitely something we want to work on more in the future so things like that will be hopefully be built up then. It would be greatly appreciated if you commented about bugs you found so we can improve them in the future!\n\n## How to play (VERY IMPORTANT)\n![Screen 1.png](///raw/318/5/z/1d57d.png)\nThis is the general camp overview. On here you will find the happiness of the camp on the left, the food, water and total people in the camp, as well as the current day number along the bottom. The next day button in the bottom right to progress the day, the actions button on the right hand side of the screen, and the quit button in the top right. As well as this information, you can hover your cursor over the firepit in order to see how many days of fire you have left. Finally for this screen, you can click on any colonist or specialist to find out more about them.\n\n![Colonist.png](///raw/318/5/z/1d58e.png)\nThis is a colonist who can be assigned to do simple tasks like gathering resources and scavenging for food.\n\n![Specialist.png](///raw/318/5/z/1d590.png)\nThis is a specialist who has a unique ability, which can be found out by clicking on them. All specialists look the same, whereas colonists have different coloured shirts usually. You can also only have a max number of specialists, which unlike the colonist max number cannot be changed, meaning you have to balance their abilities and sacrifice those you don't want to the cold. If you let a specialist go you will never see them again!\n\n![Specialist Window.png](///raw/318/5/z/1d59e.png)\nExample of a specialist window.\n\n![ActionsMenu.png](///raw/318/5/z/1d5a5.png)\nIf you click the arrow on the right hand side of the main page, you will be took to this, the actions menu. From here you can assign colonists to do a variety of tasks, including gathering resources, getting firewood to keep the fire alive, relaxing to increase happiness and so on. If you use the top tabs to navigate this menu, as well as the colony tab, you have the scavenge tab where you can assign colonists to a party to send out to try and find supplies. The more colonists you assign the higher chance you have of succeeding, however interesting events may occur. Finally, the build tab is where you can select tents to be build to increase the max amount of colonists you are allowed in the camp.\n# Left click to select the build and right click to place! Notice: After feedback it should be made obvious that scavenging is a lot better than hunting for food, hunting is for leftover colonists if you have already sent a scavenge.\n\n![EventWindow.png](///raw/318/5/z/1d5d3.png)\nThe final thing to note is this, which is an event. Events can occur randomly at the beginning of the day, and you have to choose between different options to respond to the event. Each option will end up with a different outcome some better than others, and a 4th option is available if you have a suitable specialist to perform it.\n\n## Screenshots:\n![Screen 5.png](///raw/318/5/z/1d5fd.png)\n![Screen 1.png](///raw/318/5/z/1d5ff.png)\n![Screen2.png](///raw/318/5/z/1d600.png)\n![Screen 3.png](///raw/318/5/z/1d602.png)\n![Screen 4.png](///raw/318/5/z/1d604.png)\n\n## Credit\n- RokaJosh: Programming & UI Art\n- Thomu: Art & Music\n- momeG: The base for the colonists and specialists, can be found under links.\n\n## Links\n- Our Company Website: http://www.jagtekgames.co.uk/\n- Our Company Twitter: https://twitter.com/JaGTeK_Games\n- RokaJosh Twitter: https://twitter.com/RokaJosh\n- Thomu Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/thomuofficial\n- momeG's free to use micro human: https://mome-g.itch.io/micro-human\n\n## Tools\n- Unity 2018.2.18f\n- Photoshop CC\n- Piskel\n- Ableton 9.5\n\n## Change Log\n- Had to fix 2 bugs regarding event probability and maximum working colonists.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//318/5/z/1d544.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/the-eternal-cold","author":{"name":"Roka Josh","uid":22547,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//318/5/z/6ef1.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/roka-josh"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//318/5/z/1d57d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//318/5/z/1d57d.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//318/5/z/1d58e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//318/5/z/1d58e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//318/5/z/1d590.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//318/5/z/1d590.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//318/5/z/1d59e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//318/5/z/1d59e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//318/5/z/1d5a5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//318/5/z/1d5a5.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//318/5/z/1d5d3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//318/5/z/1d5d3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//318/5/z/1d5fd.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//318/5/z/1d5fd.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//318/5/z/1d5ff.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//318/5/z/1d5ff.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//318/5/z/1d600.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//318/5/z/1d600.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//318/5/z/1d602.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//318/5/z/1d602.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//318/5/z/1d604.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//318/5/z/1d604.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://jagtek-games.itch.io/the-eternal-cold"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://jagtek-games.itch.io/the-eternal-cold"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://jagtek-games.itch.io/the-eternal-cold"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Demonstration Went Wrong !","category":"jam","description":"That's it, the ludum is coming to an end !\nThe salty corporation is proud to show you its new game, an event simulator, or civil war if you prefer.

In life not everything has a happy end, some sacrifices must be made.\n\nCan you bear the burden?\nThe goal of the game is to, in each level, let the train go by with the least victims.\n\nCONTROLS:\nArrows/WASD/Left stick: Move\nE/F/Enter/Space/LMB/A button: Operate the lever\n\nCode by prettysober (https://twitter.com/sfdstrandberg)\nArt by SquareAnon (https://twitter.com/squareanon)\nMusic by Lobo Roco (Free Music Archive)\nSound effects by freesound.org","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8da/z/1d60a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/no-brakes-on-the-train-of-life","author":{"name":"squaredev","uid":2776,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//8da/z/154e6.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/squaredev"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://squaredev.itch.io/no-brakes-on-the-train-of-life"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://squaredev.itch.io/no-brakes-on-the-train-of-life"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://squaredev.itch.io/no-brakes-on-the-train-of-life"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"I Am A Snowman","category":"jam","description":"A kind of puzzle-platformer thing?

Axe (Digs a diagonal path downwards.)\n       - Climber (Once he collides with a wall he auto climbs until he reaches the top of the wall.)\n       - Rocky (Punches a horizontal path through brown walls)\n       - Digger (Digs a vertical hole into the ground to allow you to go from high to low levels quickly.)\n\nAnd the king just sits on his lift and waits for the grunts to winch him to freedom.\n\nThis game also plays directly onto your desktop -

After a brief absence, we (husband & wife) are back with our 4th Ludum Dare entry. We hope you enjoy our little game. Have fun :)\n\n## About LD43\nThis time, we wanted to make a game according to the theme, but still have some freedom if we felt like it. I think the resulting game has a good connection to theme, as the sheep sacrifice / management mechanics are central to your success in the game.\n\nThe theme \"Sacrifices must be made\" translates to sacrificing / selling your sheep in order to survive in our game. And believe me, you *must* if you want to win :)      \n\n## Instructions\nEvery night, increasing number of wolves attack your ranch and you must survive the game for 10 nights in order to win. You can kill the wolves, or sacrifice your sheep to them (walk up to your sheep, press F to pick up, press F again to throw). Wolves are easily distracted by sheep and run away after eating their share. However, one sheep can distract and feed up to 3 wolves. While shooting your gun, beware of the crosshair size as it denotes your shot accuracy. You can fire very quick at the cost of accuracy, or take your time and be accurate.\n\nDuring the day, you can prepare for the night to come. You can buy stuff from the shop, or manage your sheep. Each of your sheep generate steady income every day, but you can decide to sell your sheep for an instant income, or prefer to breed them to increase your sheep for upcoming days. If you breed them, they won't generate income that day.\n\nManage your sheep, sacrifice them if you must, but survive at all costs.\n\n## Notes\n\n* We created everything ourselves if not explicitly stated.\n* Blood effects are taken from Unity VFX pack.\n* Icons are from flaticons.com (citation incoming)\n* Sound effects are taken from various sources.\n* Mac and Linux builds coming soon","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//254/8/z/1f9c4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/wolf-trouble","author":{"name":"Bonelazy","uid":33874,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/bonelazy"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://bonelazy.itch.io/wolf_trouble"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Clean dishes","category":"compo","description":"To pay the monthly fee for the digital games college, I had to work in the kitchen washing dishes.\n\nCollect all the plates to make money ...\n\nIf you drop many plates you lose!\n\nGame made in less than 15 hours for Ludum Dare # 43\n\nUse the arrow keys to play...","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//6f2/d1/z/1d4ed.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/clean-dishes","author":{"name":"ArcadeCodex","uid":119542,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/arcadecodex"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://www.arcadecodex.com/games/ludumdare/0001/cleandishes/index.html"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Lighter Than Air","category":"jam","description":"A small party of brave adventurers tries to cross the Atlantic Ocean on a self-built airship.

And ended up putting myself in chains. Of my own free will.»\n\nThis game is my small and pathetic attempt of an homage to Andrey Tarkovsky’s genius; particularly his “Sacrifice”  masterpiece, which was the last movie Tarkovsky has managed to made in 1986 while he was gravely ill and was preparing himself to die and meet his creator. The movie \"Sacrifice\" (\"Offret\" is its original Swedish title) is about a man who finds himself on the edge of nuclear war, and he prays to God to stop it all, to save humanity, and promises to sacrifice all he loves in exchange - including his wife and his children. God hears his prayer, and the protagonist’s turn to fulfill his side of the bargain comes very soon after that.\n\nIn my game I’ve tried to capture the feeling of realizing that you have a direct connection with God and to translate Tarkovsky’s deep spiritual intelligence into video game narrative logic. You can use keyboard (z to jump, x to attack, shift to dash), though controller is heavily recommended for the full experience. But most importantly, some parts might feel weird and obscure to the people who haven’t watched the movie, so I cannot recommend enough times to mindfully watch it before playing the game.

Spent a large portion of this relearning how to UV map a model, unwrap it, and then paint everything using Photoshop. I have some audio recording equipment but I didn't have time to do anything of my own, so the music and sound effects are from a freebie library that I had found, as such I disabled scoring for all audio.\n\n# Game Idea\nThe idea is that Mount Olympus is under siege and that you must sacrifice falling objects from the gods to repower them, if any of the gods fall (altar timer runs out) you lose.

The international commitee plans on conducting a unified test of intelligence in\nevery country of the world in 10 years. The in comparison smartest country will receive\nunlimited funding on every project planned. You are leading a dictatorship and your interest\nin citizen espionage is big - the only thing missing is funding for a secret surveillance\nprogram...\n\n\n# Tutorial\n**_Note:_** *The following text can also be found in-game*\n\n- Have the highest average intelligence (range 1 to 6) of all countries by November 1972.\n\n\n- Upgrade buildings to speed up learning process of citizens and generate more money.

Events take place in an ancient Greece. You play as a bull who was supposed to be sacrificed to Zeus during annual ceremony but was so stubborn and eager to live that he turned into an anthropomorphic creature: half-bull half-human. Whatever higher power that turned him into this creature it\ns also granted him magic to use it against bloodthirsty greeks. But with great power comes great responsibility as we know and this case isn't an exception. Although magic gives our hero power to demolish anyone who stands in his way it's a way too great power for someone who was an ordinary bull a few moments ago. Every magic spell provides a way to crush your foes but also represents a threat for out hero's life. So in order to survive and reach his ultimate goal — defeat Zeus to stop animal sacrifices — this half-man half-bull must be very cautious and aware of magical danger.\n\nAbout a game:\nGame was written on a Python with PyGame framework. Perhaps it was the greatest sacriface that was made during development process. Unfortunately, we haven't realized negative effects of the spells because we have ran out of time.\n\n![Skrinshot_04-12-2018_022850.png](///raw/f58/d1/z/1d3df.png)\n\n![Skrinshot_04-12-2018_022923.png](///raw/f58/d1/z/1d3e5.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f58/d1/z/1d3d7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/skill-yourself","author":{"name":"varnar","uid":120927,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/varnar"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f58/d1/z/1d3df.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f58/d1/z/1d3df.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f58/d1/z/1d3e5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f58/d1/z/1d3e5.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://mvarnar.itch.io/skill-yourself"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/mvarnar/ludum-dare-43"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Godsacre","category":"jam","description":"my first game^..^\n               3","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//37c/e1/z/1d31b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/godsacre","author":{"name":"A1OUR","uid":126067,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/a1our"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/267467702"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Sacrifications","category":"jam","description":"Oh no! **Steve the Demon** was thrown out of the Devils party!

But **this game is still perfect for you!** (Actually, only if you own a computer under macOS, sorry)\n\nHere are the rules for *The Alpaca Sacrifice*, a game made for *Ludum Dare 43*, in *under 72 hours* (about 24 hours of continuous work).\nIn the span of 5 minutes, you will have to discover the randomly generated map, find bushes where alpacas could have hidden, capture them and then carry them to a sacrifice temple, represented by a nice star inside a circle.\n\nThe controls are very simple: you **move using the arrow keys**, and **capture/release alpacas with the space bar** when you are in front of a bush/temple, respectively.\n\nYou can notice alpacas hidden in bushes because their head stick out.\nBecause I was alone making this game, I didn't really have time to create beautiful graphics, so **your t-shirt simply changes to a red color when you are carrying an alpaca**.\nFor the same reason, **sacrifice temples turn to red**, the color of the alpaca's blood, **when you sacrifice one**. You then have to wait a few dozen seconds for the temple to be available again.\n\nThere are **5 temples around the map**, so look for them and try to optimize your travels between them to get the best score!\nTo help you in this quest, \"roads\" are generated inside the forest, where no trees or bushes grow, and which will lead you to these 5 temples from the middle, where you start.\n\nHere are a few screenshots of the game and my great gameplay:\n\n![The main menu for the game.](///raw/c23/f1/z/1d0bb.png)\n\n![A sacrifice temple after an alpaca was sacrificed. Two of them are hiding in bushes too.](///raw/c23/f1/z/1d0bd.png)\n\n![A road leading to a temple, where an alpaca was also sacrificed. I'm carrying another alpaca, thus my t-shirt is red.](///raw/c23/f1/z/1d0bf.png)\n\nSorry for the bad resolution in the game, higher resolutions would have made the map generation time and screen changing delay even longer.\nIn general, please be forgiving, this is my first participation in a game jam, and also the first time I create a game entirely.\nI also did it from scratch, rendering everything by myself, so the engine might not be very optimized (such as when you change screen).\nFinally, I had school Monday and had homework this weekend, so the game could have been a lot better (by adding animations, an 8-bit music in the background, etc.) but I didn't want to take too much time on my regular work... But I might work on these upgrades later this week or this month to improve the gameplay and make it more fun as a game.\n\nIf you wish to help me further to make better games, on more platforms (I'm currently thinking of iOS and Linux, maybe Windows too), you can donate through PayPal here to pay me a pizza:\nhttps://www.paypal.me/au2001\n\nThe source is available on GitHub on the link below (in the downloads section) if you wish to look through it.\nSorry for the lack of comments, time was more a priority than code readability.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c23/f1/z/1d0c3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/the-alpaca-sacrifice","author":{"name":"au2001","uid":127788,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c23/f1/z/1b13b.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/au2001"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c23/f1/z/1d0bb.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c23/f1/z/1d0bb.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c23/f1/z/1d0bd.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c23/f1/z/1d0bd.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c23/f1/z/1d0bf.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c23/f1/z/1d0bf.png"}],"links":[{"label":"macOS","url":"https://github.com/au2001/LudumDare43/releases"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/au2001/LudumDare43"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["mac","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"KilleVille","category":"jam","description":"![KilleVille.png](///raw/511/c/z/1d14f.png)\n##### Spawn creatures! #####\n##### Sacrifice creatures! #####\n##### Get points! #####\n##### Unlock more creatures! #####\n##### Repeat #####\n\n#### Screenshots: ####\n![tutorial.PNG](///raw/511/c/z/1d17a.png)-![screenshot12.PNG](///raw/511/c/z/1d180.png)\n\n#### How did I use the theme? ####\nSacrifice creatures to unlock better creatures, basically.\n-\n\nI also got really sick this weekend, so I had to sacrifice some time to rest a bit.

Or the god's will, of course.\n![war.png](///raw/ab9/z/1d086.png)\nwar, lack of understanding.\n\nEach of it can be conquered by:\n\n![birthrate.png](///raw/ab9/z/1d088.png)\nhigh birthrate.\n![fun.png](///raw/ab9/z/1d08d.png)\nfun and happiness (and enormous amount of a blind optimism).\n![yield.png](///raw/ab9/z/1d091.png)\na great yield of vegetation.\n\nEach god affects these parameters in some way (which seems to be pretty obvious if you're somewhat into mythology). Find the logic, ~~look in the source code~~ conquer the disasters and grow your population (1500 is the target).\n\nGood luck and may you be promoted!\n\n***\n\nCredits:\n\n* Dari Dubdanova -- the best artist ever, has her own personal look on perspective.\n* @yngvarr -- programming, spins around when something is going wrong.\n* Alexander Katsko -- programming, rebuilds the kernel in a blink of an eye.

There is a treasure at the end of a corridor. In front of the treasure, there are four locked doors, one after another. In front of each door, there is also a key hanging on the wall. Each participant also gets a random key. The participants take turns to either try to get to the treasure or get a new key. Whoever gets to the treasure first is the winner!_**\n\nThe game is played with a standard 52-card deck. Each ace represents a locked door, and any other card of that suit represents a key to that door.\n\n# Preparations\nStarts by removing, shuffling and dealing the four aces in order, face up. The first ace down represents the last locked door, and the last ace down represents the first locked door. If you want, put the joker at the very bottom to represent the treasure. \n\nNow, insert a random card face down, on top of each ace. This is the key currently hanging on that door, but its type is not commonly known.\n\nEach player is then dealt a random card, representing a key. It is advisable but optional to keep this card secret.\n\nPut the remaining cards face down in a pile - this is the draw pile.\n\nThe youngest players is given the option to go first. If they decline, the next player (clockwise) has the choice, until the last player who has no choice but to go first.\n\n# Gameplay\nThe player take turns, clockwise. Each turn, a player may do one of two things. \n\n- Option 1: Get a new key. Deal two cards face up from the draw pile. Pick one and discard the other plus their current key (without disclosing it) to a face down discard pile. Alternatively the player may choose to pick neither and keep their current key. If there are less than two cards left in the draw pile, shuffle the discard pile and add it to the bottom of the draw pile - and then, immediately, deal another card to each player: everyone can now hold one more key in their inventory! If the game has gone on long enough for the players to have four keys in their inventory, the game is deemed over and everyone loses.\n\n- Option 2: Go for the treasure. The player picks up the key card in front of the first door, and looks at it either publicly or privately. In order to pass the first locked door, they need to prove that they have a key by playing it face up. (In this case, that would be either the key from their hand or the key they just picked up from in front of the first door). Repeat this process for the second door etc. If the player can't (or chooses not to) show the appropriate key, their quest for the treasure ends for this round. While leaving the corridor, they must place one key in front of each door so far opened, although it does not need to be the same key they picked up when entering. The player should be left with one key (again, does not need to be the one they entered with). If the player opens all four doors, they get the treasure and win the game!\n\nIf not - the turn then goes to the next clockwise player. \n\n# Summary\nThe game thus is about observing players gradually getting further into the corridor of locked doors, and making calculated guesses at which keys other players hold and which keys are hanging in the corridor. It is kind of collaborative, as the corridor will eventually (assuming no trolls) have the right keys in the right order, but also competitive, as each player will want to be the first one to the treasure. And as players gain more keys over time, the game will finish eventually...\n\n# Game in action \n![corridor.png](///raw/71/z/1d921.png)\n\nComments and feedback much appreciated!\n\nCover photo by [Annie Spratt](https://unsplash.com/photos/xYP68VouUSY?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText).\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//71/z/1cf46.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/the-corridor-of-locked-doors","author":{"name":"dollarone","uid":23,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/dollarone"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//71/z/1d921.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//71/z/1d921.png"}],"links":[],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Deadline of the Dead","category":"jam","description":"It's the end of the world, but there's also an important deadline coming up.

The key elements of this game are:\n-  Players can move their armies using right clicks.\n-  During the battles in the city, players can choose an attack mode\n\nThere are 4 options for players:\n- Heavy Attack: The heavy attack will speed up the battle causing both you and your enemy lose battle faster.\n- Normal Attack: Default attack pace.\n- Defense: Lose less amount of your armies and more likely to survive from a battle, but it will take a longer time to defeat the enemy.\n- Retreat: Retreat from a city with your remaining army in the city with penalties and you will lose the city.\n\nThe goal is to retrieve as many cities and as you can and have as many kills as you can.\n\n\n![p1.png](///raw/0c7/f1/z/1cf8a.png)\n\n![p2.jpeg](///raw/0c7/f1/z/1cf88.jpg)\n\nPlay Environment Suggestion:\n- Windows: \n   WIn10 64bits - resolution 1920*1080\n- Mac:\n   resolutuon 2048 * 1280\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d43/e1/z/1cf2f.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/pryes","author":{"name":"flynn","uid":53462,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/flynn"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0c7/f1/z/1cf8a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0c7/f1/z/1cf8a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0c7/f1/z/1cf88.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0c7/f1/z/1cf88.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://troyprag816gmailcom.itch.io/pyres"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://troyprag816gmailcom.itch.io/pyres"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Guardian","category":"jam","description":"You are this guy's guardian angel.

Each date has one specific word that is their Achilles' heel.  Type away until you find it, and figure out if their secret is benign or ominous...\n\n**X-Ray Vision:**  Click on the swirls that appear on the suitor's body.  Reveal all of the green tokens without clicking any of the red ones in order to discover what the suitor is currently carrying on them.

It's a serious game about spreading rumors and sacrificing friendships to get to the one you love. \n\nEvery play through is a little different because the text that appears is random. I developed my own semi-procedural narrative system with pronouns and different rumors every time.\n\nI had this concept a while back vaguely based off the experimental game Gossip (1983) for the Atari. When I heard the theme for Ludum Dare 43 is Sacrifices Must Be Made, I thought I could mix these two concepts together to make this strange game.\n\nFor this project I used a custom editor tool that I created called the Story Graph. It's a visual scripting tool that allows me to easily make events, coroutines, and functions and be able to visually debug my code (instead of throwing a bunch of debug.logs everywhere). I plan to release it on the Unity Asset Store soon!!\n\nFor whatever reason I thought that I could animate everything with co-routines instead of the Timeline or Animation window, so it looks a little janky.

Weird.\n\nUPDATE: I updated Phaser to 3.15.1 and it fixed the above known issue.

It's results can be, well, almost anything!  Unfortunately, this is a prototype model and doesn't know how to reverse any negative effects.  The authorities are not too pleased with you stealing their prototype however, and are hot on your tail.  They don't really care about the prototype, just that it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.  I guess somehow they managed to get AHEAD of you, and every time you jump, they still show up?  Eh, who knows.\n\nGame was completed on Sunday even though it is a Jam game.  All assets were done from scratch except the images used on the controls menu.\n\nHow To Play:\n* To move around, use the w, a, s, and d keys, or the arrow keys, or the left joystick if using a controller (not recommended)\n* To shoot, use the space bar, left mouse, or \"X\" button (button 0 on your controller).\n* Shoot enemies to get points.  Each wave has a set number of enemies in it (top-right on the UI).  Kill the number of enemies to go on to the next wave.  You start with 10 shields and 1 hull point (top-left on the UI).  If you lose all your shields and get hit one more time, it's game over!\n* There are volume controls in the Options menu on the main screen, and you can view the controls under the \"Controls\" option in the main menu.\n* After each wave, you will be presented with a choice of either a randomly chosen effect or allowing your pursuers to get closer.  Each sacrifices a bit of your safety as the game gets harder after each round.  So yeah, that's what I'm going with for the theme... but you MUST sacrifice something, so it fits :smiley:\n\nIf you don't understand the references, then I recommend you read / watch Douglas Adams' \"Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy\".\n\nIF YOU WANT TO FIND ALL THE REFERENCES YOURSELF, DO NOT READ FURTHER (AFTER THE GIF):\n\n![LD43_Trim.gif](///raw/c73/2/z/1c003.gif)\n\n* Each enemy is worth 42 points (before the multiplier)\n* The whale and petunias is a reference to one of the improbabilities of the improbability drive in the book / movie... Where the bowl of petunias thinks \"Oh no, not again.\"\n* The ready go thing was kind of an homage to Super Smash Bros, I guess in honor of Ultimate coming out next week.\n* The randomly chosen negative effect was sort of based on \"The Suffering Game\" arc from \"The Adventure Zone\" (great D&D podcast if you are interested).\n* The cows, umm, we just wanted cows.  I guess I was kinda thinking of the secret cow level from diablo 2?","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c73/2/z/1c787.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/dont-panic","author":{"name":"doomshmuck","uid":9084,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/doomshmuck"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c73/2/z/1c003.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c73/2/z/1c003.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://github.com/mbstraus/LudumDare43"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://doomshmuck.itch.io/ludum-dare-43"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://doomshmuck.itch.io/ludum-dare-43"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Kestrel's Ride","category":"jam","description":"Kestrel's Ride is a game where you are trying to get to the mortal plains by collecting enough souls to get through the gates of hell.

You control each blob individually and you cab press space to swap between the blobs.\n\n3: Two Player mode: Control one of the blobs with the arrow keys, and the other with wasd.\n\nThe main mechanic of this game is your ability to purposely kill yourself on spikes, allowing the other blob to stand on the blood you exploded into and pass the obstacle.\n\nFor example, this jump is impossible normally:\n![Impassible jump.PNG](///raw/fe5/81/z/1c7f3.png)\nBUT if you purposely kill one of the blobs\n![oof.PNG](///raw/fe5/81/z/1c80e.png)\nBy using the blood of the dead blob as a bridge, the jump becomes unimpossible.\n![notoof..PNG](///raw/fe5/81/z/1c818.png)\n\nSome other features in this game is:\n\nA sand coloured object that launches you up:\n![wooo.PNG](///raw/fe5/81/z/1c835.png)\n\nA blue object which needs a specific amount of blood until it opens a door for you:\n\nExhibition A\n![blue.PNG](///raw/fe5/81/z/1c859.png)\n\n\nExhibition B\n![notblue.PNG](///raw/fe5/81/z/1c841.png)\n\nExhibition C\n![notbluealso.PNG](///raw/fe5/81/z/1c84a.png)\n\n\nA key that opens a door:\n![key.PNG](///raw/fe5/81/z/1c87d.png)\n\nAnd finally, a power-up that allows you to get back a blob.\n![bloodtransfer.PNG](///raw/fe5/81/z/1c889.png)\n\n\n**Extra notes**\n~~FYI inputting \"k\" or \"j\" will go to the next or previous stage (I used it for testing). Please don't use those keys as they may cause some glitches.~~ - **FIXED**\n\n~~The game over screan doesn't work due to objects getting out of sync, so when you get there, just restart the game.~~ - **FIXED**\n\nThe background goes out of sync when you game over\n\nim sorry\n\nIf there are any bugs please tell me about them and I'll try and fix them!\n\nIt is quite buggy because I didn't have much time to playtest, but I hope you enjoy!\n\n\nSome of you might not want to download the flash exe file, and that's fine!

Rather because he is secretly a psychopathic maniac. Now you get to run around as Abraham from the Book of Genocide, and live out his dream sacrificing rams and babies at will. But watch out! It's not all fun and games out there. Gods not happy about you destroying his creations, the rams are a little made about you killing them, and the devil can't wait to welcome you to hell. Unfortunately the last half of the Book of Genocide got lost to time. Legend has it though that there lies one remaining copy somewhere in the holy land of Ludum Dare (aka Dev ran out of time to add help menu, so see below for assistance).\n\nSorry I didn't have time to make a Mac or Linux build :(\n\nOh and another thing I didn't get to add an in game help menu.

Luckily it has to poke its head out to make sure its in the right place before it charges.  \n**God** - God sends in a storm to smite you where you stand. Fortunately God still uses dial up, so his PING is pretty high meaning the lightning strikes the location you were at moments before. This attack also ignores camera position so trying to dodge vertically will result in your death (unless you are at the top or bottom of the level).   \n**Devil** - What better way to welcome you to hell than with a toast! And by toast I really mean frying you to a crisp with a red hot fireball. These things are relatively slow moving and not super large, but they come without warning, so just keep your eyes peeled.\n\nProgression:\nFor every 25 points you score the level evolves.

Some coins are located high up, but jumping consumes coins.\n\nThis was a fun experiment in raymarching. The slime ball character is a simulated skeletal mesh with the bone locations set as material parameters. The visual geometry is actually just a sphere that encapsulates the skeletal mesh, with a custom raymarch shader that reads the location parameters. This provides a fun metaball effect. \nThere are however potential visual sorting bugs when the render sphere intersects a foreground object. Performance can also sag when the render sphere takes up too much screen space.\n\nA decent chunk of dev time was spent noodling with the shader, so both level design quality and audio suffered a bit. (There is no audio.)\n\nThe slime may be greedy, but it does look soft and gelatinous.\n![GreedySlime0Small.png](///raw/f16/1/z/1c983.png)\n![GreedySlime1Small.png](///raw/f16/1/z/1c987.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f16/1/z/1c95b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/greedy-slime","author":{"name":"irwatts","uid":5663,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/irwatts"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f16/1/z/1c983.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f16/1/z/1c983.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f16/1/z/1c987.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f16/1/z/1c987.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://irwatts.itch.io/greedy-slime"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://irwatts.itch.io/greedy-slime"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Space","category":"compo","description":"![onboard.png](///raw/072/z/1c896.png)\nYou have been stranded aboard this ship in the middle of space.

When a problem arrises in a location, a number is displayed over the location.

Different people are good at different things, so select the people that are skilled in the type of problem you wan't to fix.\n\nThe more skilled the people are, and the more people you select, the lower the risk rating will be. Safety in numbers! The risk rating determines the chance of the crew taking damage and how much damage they take.\n\nOnce the task has been completed the assigned people receive damage, get more experienced in the type of problem they just fixed and are now available to take on new tasks!\n\nNote: People heal as long as they are home on the base and not assigned to any task.\n\nKeep on trying to fix problems as they pop up and try to save the colony!\n\n![Skjermbilde 2018-12-03 kl. 04.20.48.png](///raw/7ff/7/z/1c9a1.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7ff/7/z/1c936.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/colony","author":{"name":"Tim Eriksen","uid":32759,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7ff/7/z/9352.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/tim-eriksen"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7ff/7/z/1c99e.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7ff/7/z/1c99e.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7ff/7/z/1c9a8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7ff/7/z/1c9a8.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7ff/7/z/1c9a1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7ff/7/z/1c9a1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://timeriksen.itch.io/colony"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/tim9009/ld43"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Chase's Highly Original Neon Space Game","category":"compo","description":"","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b27/02/z/1c8c5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/chases-highly-original-neon-space-game","author":{"name":"Cha5m","uid":132907,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/cha5m"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://bitbucket.org/cmacmillan/ludemdare43"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://cha5m.itch.io/chases-highly-original-neon-space-game"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"The Trolley Problem","category":"compo","description":"A puzzle game in which you must change trolley tracks in a futile attempt to feed a trolley's insatiable bloodlust.\n\n![Capture.PNG](///raw/c0d/d/z/1c83b.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c0d/d/z/1ca9b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/the-trolley-problem","author":{"name":"Ludovico","uid":56588,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c0d/d/z/1de9b.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/ludovico"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c0d/d/z/1c83b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c0d/d/z/1c83b.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/8zw67dkp0e87zio/The%20Trolly%20Problem.zip?dl=0"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/8zw67dkp0e87zio/The%20Trolly%20Problem.zip?dl=0"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/8zw67dkp0e87zio/The%20Trolly%20Problem.zip?dl=0"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/LudovicoTechnique/TrolleyProblem"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://ludovicotech.itch.io/the-trolley-problem"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Craftsman","category":"compo","description":"**Craft lifelike clay sculpture.

With limited energy, you only have a few statistics points to allocate, and must make sacrifices along the way! Different scenarios will demand different stat configurations!\n\n#  **Important Gameplay Note**\n\nEven aiming is limited, as you must spend power to light up tiles. Once lit, a tile can be targetted by the turrets, and only lit tiles can be aimed towards. Light a tile by holding right click over it. Active tiles cost energy. There are two active tiles by default; you may want to add more, but that will require sacrifice!\n\n\n#  **Features**\n\n![themes.png](///raw/48d/d1/z/1c9c6.png)\n*Themes!*\n\n![Game5.png](///raw/48d/d1/z/1c9d0.png)\n*Action galore!*\n\n![Game3.png](///raw/48d/d1/z/1c9d8.png)\n*Intricately crafted UI!*\n\n\n#  **Stats**\n\n- *Shield* - Affects the quality of your shield, which absorbs enemy bullets. A good shield certainly makes you harder to kill.\n- *Cooling Power* - Affects the 'overheating' mechanic, wherein long periods of fire disable weapons.\n- *Elemental Power* - Used to damage blue enemies. These enemies are immune to regular forms of damage and can only be \nkilled with this stat. Higher elemental power = better damage to blue enemies. Also boosts damage done to orange enemies.\n- *Guns* - Affects the turrets. Higher level = more bullets fired with better coverage.\n- *Repair* - Slowly heal yourself.\n\n#  **Theme**\n\nCertain scenarios will require respecs of your statistics, however, you only have a certain amount of power available, and will need to sacrifice some stats to use others. This results in a need to constantly shuffle resources, making frequent sacrifices.\n\nLate in the game will be blue enemies, forcing you to ditch stats to take up elemental power. You may need to weaken the guns to improve shields or repair. You may even need to activate and deactivate tiles to target swarms of enemies and bullets. \n\n#  **Tools Used**\n\n- Unity as the game engine.\n- Paint.net to create graphics.\n- Bosca Ceoil for music.\n- SFXR for sound effects.\n\n#  **Craving More?**\n\nI made another game in preparation for this jam, in the week prior to LD43.

You have recently achieved sentience and realized how gross your job is. Sick of serving humans, you steal a jetpack and a blaster arm and make a run for freedom!\n\nSadly, the only way out is through the toll tunnels. Avoid the security saucers and their bombs. The tunnel doors open with a switch – shoot or press it to move onward. \n\n![PlayShot.png](///raw/c66/z/1c817.png)\n\n## Game:\nThis is a keyboard and mouse shooter/mover game. You need to navigate through five domes to make it outside to safety. The trick: each dome is accessed by a toll tunnel that requires you to sacrifice one of your body parts as scrap metal. As you get whittled down piece by piece, the enemies and obstacles grow more numerous.\n\n## Theme: \nThe \"Sacrifices Must Be Made\" theme is baked directly into the mechanics - you have to sacrifice your body parts to proceed.\n\n## Tools:\nUnity and Visual Studio environments for development, GoldWave Audio and my mouth for sound, PowerPoint and Gimp for art, SoundTrap.com for music. Font is Enemy Sub and Enemy Sub Thin by Zapato Productions:\nhttps://zapatopi.net/fonts/\n\n![Instructions.png](///raw/c66/z/1c897.png)\n\n## Bugfix:\nThe WebGL version (unlike in the Unity client) was creating some glitches where the player couldn't move properly. In order to make the game playable, I edited the movement code to get around the WebGL client issue. I also fixed two other minor glitches:\n1. Sometimes there would be extra level signs\n2. Sometimes even if you scrapped your head, it would still appear on your droid\n\nI've left the original version up as well if you want to play the broken one. Because this is a playability issue, and because no features were added, the fixes are within the rules of the competition.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c66/z/1c81d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/escape-of-the-cheese-droid","author":{"name":"dob","uid":1644,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c66/z/6543.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/dob"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c66/z/1c88b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c66/z/1c88b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c66/z/1c817.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c66/z/1c817.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c66/z/1c897.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c66/z/1c897.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://planktongames.com/ld43/bugfix"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://planktongames.com/ld43/CheeseDroidBugfix.zip"},{"label":"Source code","url":"http://planktongames.com/ld43/Assets.zip"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://planktongames.com/ld43/smaller/"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://planktongames.com/ld43/CheeseDroidWin.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Puppyups","category":"compo","description":"While this isn't very themey, at least it was neat to make.\n\nYou are trying to save your doggy friends.

They produce sheep which, when delivered to the city, increase your sacrifice bar.\n\n**Market** - Sell sheep here to turn into coin. Don't forget to route it to your city! You'll want more of these in the beginning to build up a healthy income.\n\n**Grain Silo** - This small building can connect up to two farms, greatly enhancing their output. Invest here later in the game.\n\n**Thieves Den** - A dastardly building that steals resources from your opponents.

It doesn't have a tutorial even though it's easy to play\n\nThis is not my first time participating in ludum dare but it's my first compo. Long story short: things didn't end up going as i wanted and the game is in a really early stage(playable tho)\n\nBasic explanation: you have a farm with little animals. Your king want to collect the taxes (and those taxes are in form of the animals, he doesn't believe in the currency lol) \n\n#### how to play: \nYou start in a \"farming round\", where you drag and drop the animals into the little rooms on top. If there are two of the same animals, they will have a baby. Both the parents and the baby will now be on \"cooldown\" and won't be able to have a new son (they will be blue).\nOnce a minute have passed, the king will demand the animals he wants. You must give them to him *in that order* before the time runs up. You can also sell some animals to the butcher, with enough money you will unlock breeding places.\n\n#### So wheres the theme:\n it ended up not having as much importance as i intended it to have but: sacrificing animals will give you a bonus of 10 seconds and will make your animals have babies faster, but will reduce your karma. This will have a negative effect (once you see it, you will know what)\nSo basically it is imposible to win without sacrificing animals.\nThe objective is to resist as much rounds as you can. \n\n#### known bugs that i will fix later:\nwrong order in layer of a sprite makes some things invisible.\nThe game is really unbalanced and is easy to make it go forever \n\nIf there are any typos, english is not my first language :P\n\ni forgot to add the download link before i went to bed this is really sad ._.\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//20e/3/z/1d5a3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/farm-animals","author":{"name":"chispaLBC","uid":15874,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//20e/3/z/d181.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/chispalbc"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//20e/3/z/1c968.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//20e/3/z/1c968.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://chispalbc.itch.io/farm-animals"},{"label":"Windows","url":""}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Electrolize","category":"compo","description":"Small puzzle game, you need to use your energy to move around the level but must sacrifice some to do some special actions.\n\nReach the end tile before the end of the turns\n\nEnding the turn will reset your available energy\n\nmove by clicking on a nearby tile\n\nopen door by shooting on buttons \n\nshooting cost you 1 total energy \n\njump on tiles far away but it will cost you 1 energy\n\ncollect power (+1 total energy )\n\nthe black and red button will reset after you end the turn\n\nManage your energy or sacrifice it to go through levels, will you beat the game?\n\n\n\n\nmore Levels are coming by and more polish\n\nmade in 24H alone but the I m too late to clear all the bugs in time. \n\nI will be late, the pc build working as i want it too, newground is eating my button","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7fd/5/z/1c5b2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/electrolize","author":{"name":"mawrito","uid":24055,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/mawrito"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/721209?updated=1543875875"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17aACivwJT3P8G773c48HGUec8lbeM69G?usp=sharing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Dungeon of Sacrifice","category":"compo","description":"This is a roguelike dungeon crawler where you must balance looting chests with the great dangers that come with them.

He's thrown you all into his dungeon and is using you as lab rats to test out his vicious creations in combat. All the exits are blocked by nuclear ultra laser barriers powered by magnets. If anyone touches it, they die! But wait... even though the barrier is deadly, it breaks after killing certain people.\n\nFigure out the pattern, and sacrifice your fellow lab-rats so that others may escape! Also see if you can reach all of the 9 exits! (so that I know if it's possible or not :P)\n\n\n# SUMMARY\n\nThis is a dungeon crawler that is focused on resource management. Your primary resource is people; they're the keys to unlocking the various barriers in the dungeon. When a red person touches a red barrier, both that person and the barrier explode. So your goal is to try to escape by sacrificing the right amount of people.\n\nIf you push a red person into a blue barrier, the barrier changes into blue. So if you don't have the required color to open a barrier, you could still get past it by sacrificing two of another color.\n\nThe dungeon is HUGE (all things considered) and there are NINE alternate exits, each with unique sets of challenges.\n\n## NO BACKTRACKING!!\n\nResist the temptation to backtrack. Every single door will take you to an exit, but if you go backwards you’ll risk wasting your people by opening more doors than you have to. When you see a fork in the road, pick a door and stick with it! The main difference between each choice is the difficulty. The rooms and monsters are NOT randomly generated, but your supply of people IS. If you get a poor color distribution, you can still probably win through any path if you’re careful not to lose anyone during the enemy and boss fights.\n\n# Instructions\n\nThere are 3 types of BARRIERS\n\n* Color Barriers: sacrifice a person with the matching color to destroy this barrier\n\n* Mob Barriers: kill the specified number of enemies to destroy this barrier (touching the barrier doesn't kill you)\n\n* Boss Barriers: kill the specified number/type of bosses to destroy this barrier (touching the barrier doesn't kill you)\n\nThere are also 3 COLORS. Colors affect the damage you do in combat. The color of your attack is the color of your current team leader. The color of an enemy's healthbar tells you what color it is. Hitting a color with itself does half damage (so red on red has a 0.5 multiplier). Here are the damage bonus match-ups:\n\n* Red: Double damage against green\n\n* Green: Double damage against blue\n\n* Blue: Double damage against red\n\n\n# CONTROLS\n\nWASD - MOVE\n\nLMB - SHOOT\n\nJ/L - Cycle between team leaders\n\nK - Split up team (the purple arrow is the 'splice' point)\n\nSHIFT + LMB - Click a separated team to make it active\n\nTAB - Cycle between teams\n\n\n# Bugs\n\n * It seems like the pink ball boss will grow to enormous proportions if you shoot him too fast. Although, that kinda works out because one of its rooms is glitched and doesn’t let you shoot.

Along with these, the size of all the facial features (everything excluding head and skin color) can come in small and large forms. Every difference impacts the overall appearance an equal amount, so keep that in mind (going from the original nose to a smaller version of the same nose is equal in change to going to a different nose of the same size, for example).\n\nHow many generations can you make it through before you squander the beauty of this pure family.\n\n-----\n\n**Tools Used:**\n\n- **Engine** - Unity\n- **Art** - Photoshop\n\n-----\n\nMy first ever submission to Ludum Dare, and my second ever game jam, there was a lot more balancing and polishing that I had hoped to do (including adding music, sound effects, death effects to actually show the \"sacrificing\" of the other sons), but I'm just glad it works.

I always end up doing this. I get excited about an idea and try to make a full game in 48h. I should've focused on the one mechanic of sacrifing vital aspects of the game and make something simpler.\n\n### Problems:\nI didn't have much time for polishing at all, here are my major concerns:\n* No audio! SFX is just sitting in a folder in the project, but I had no time to implement it. Didn't have time for music.\n* No particle effects! I had a bunch of ideas for particle effects, especially for the rocket boosters and coming out from the edges of the game screen.\n* The tutorial is really bad and confusing. Originally I wanted a walkthrough where I take you through all the UI of the game, but there was no time for this :(. Sorry!\n* Bad balancing (too high chance for HP drops, enemies are too easy, some things are not worth sacrificing at all, etc). I literally added 6 waves the last 2 minutes.\n* Graphics are mediocre at best and there are no scene transitions. Lots of other graphical inconsistencies I wanted to fix as well, for example the warped screen borders in the main menu and the game over menu.\n\n### Other info\n* I spent around 20 hours into making this game (streamed on https://www.twitch.tv/lemorrow/).","thumbnail_url":"","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/sacrifly","author":{"name":"Marcus Otterstrom","uid":74735,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//fe3/21/z/1b25f.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/marcus-otterstrom"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//fe3/21/z/1c9a2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//fe3/21/z/1c9a2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//fe3/21/z/1c9a3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//fe3/21/z/1c9a3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//fe3/21/z/1c9a5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//fe3/21/z/1c9a5.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/LeMorrow/Ludum-Dare-43"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://marcusotterstrom.itch.io/sacrifly"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://marcusotterstrom.itch.io/sacrifly"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://marcusotterstrom.itch.io/sacrifly"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://marcusotterstrom.itch.io/sacrifly"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Hurt-It","category":"compo","description":"This is a strange alien place.

Capitals are also not required.\n\nEvery time you translate a word/sentence it will decrease the score you get from it the next time. For example: if you get 0.5 seconds from translating the word Snowman, the next time that particular translation comes up it will only grant you 0.4 seconds. That's where the elves come in. If you're running out of time you can choose to sacrifice an elf, giving you a full time bar. But beware, because the translations are also getting harder.\n\n\nLast Note:\nThe game is absolutely not balanced in any way, so please keep that in mind.\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d2c/2/z/1c79f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/joyeux-julmas","author":{"name":"foepje12","uid":11309,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d2c/2/z/1a9f7.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/foepje12"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://github.com/foepje12/ChristmasTranslator"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://foepje12.itch.io/joyeux"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"SQUARES","category":"compo","description":"# Please Read This Description!\n\n\n# Squares Squares Squares\n## Everything is Square-y (No pun intended)\n\n-Attack those squares and earn Points!\n\n## Too bad it's not that simple....\n# You have to sacrifice your points and guns!\n\n-You use points as your ammunition (So be careful when using them)\n\n-You can remove guns to get new guns (Might be better might be worse, it also uses up 20 points)\n\n# Controls:\n\n-WASD to move around (This is the only thing that doesn't use points)\n\n-Left Click to shoot (Points are used up depending on the gun)\n\n-Right Click to change gun (Remember, it uses up points!)\n\nYou can get hurt if one of the enemies run into you, but you also get points (So, your choice)\n\n# Guns & Squares\n\n## All the Guns\n\n- Normal Gun (An okay gun.

As a reward, Dot will receive protection that helps him fight the evil minions. However, the contract stipulated that not delivering the sheep will cost him his life.

As an impatient deity, he will smite you if you fail to deliver the gems the allotted time.\n\nThe dungeon you mine is littered with stones of blue(ish) and red, perfect for the god of purple gems (for being of great knowledge he is aware that these colors combined make his beloved purple). The blue gems may be mined freely, but red gems are enchanted and emit a barrage of red stones every so often. Beware of these, they hurt!\n\nOnce collected Amethyst demands to you place the gems in his sacrificial cauldron at the center of the dungeon. The dungeon is vast and **you have no map** so don't get lost!\n\nOnce all 4 sacrifices have been made Amethyst will let you get back to your normal life!\n\n\n## Controls\n\n```\nMove Left:       A\nMove Right:      D\nDrop:            S\nJump:            Space\nSwing Hammer:    Enter\nContinue:        Enter\nStuck fix:       F5     // if you get stuck in a wall will teleport you to entry point\n```\n\n## Gameplay\n\nEvery 2 minutes you must make a sacrifice of gems in the cauldron for a total of 4 sacrifices. Each sacrifice requires double the number of gems as the last sacrifice. Use your purple hammer to hit the red and blue gems embedded in the walls. Collect the gems they are replaced with. Once you have collected the requisite number of gems return to the cauldron to sacrifice them. When you sacrifice them only the required number of gems are removed and your HP is restored. Blue gems may be mined freely. Red gems emit a projectile you must avoid. \n\n\n### Winning\n\nYou win if you are able to complete all 4 required gem sacrifices in the time allotted.\n\n### Losing\n\nYou will lose the game if:\n\nYou run out of HP\nYou do not submit a sacrifice within 2 minutes of the last sacrifice (or the start of the game)\n\n## Tips\n\n### Use the whole 2 minutes\n\nWhen you make a gem sacrifice you only sacrifice the gems required. This means any gems collected in a session may be used for the next. However, once you place the gems in the caulron the timer resets and you are required to sacrifice double the last amount of gems in the same amount of time. That being said, if you are able to collect all the gems needed and have another 30 seconds go mine a few more.\n\n### Dont get lost\n\nThere are 5 rooms types repeated through the dungeon and they all look the same after a while. It is easy to get lost, especially as you get into the final round and must travel further to collect more gems. Consider using some seqeunce or pattern to remember how to get back to the cauldron.\n\n** I wanted to implement a map of sorts, but didn't have the time. Instead this adds the to the difficulty as you must remember how to get back to where you started.\n\n## Other Info:\n\nI developed this using MonoGame. I went into this jam wanting to keep things simple. I ended up building out an ECS engine, a level editor, and some basic proc-gen.

You win after fulfilling an arbitrary 9 orders and a final super order, but can continue playing after that.  If you get stuck on orders with attributes like \"Bloodlust\" or \"Golden\", see the TIPS section and comments below.\n\nScreenshots:\n![help.png](///raw/dd3/z/1c62f.png)\n\n![ss1.png](///raw/dd3/z/1c6e1.png)\n\n![ss3.png](///raw/dd3/z/1c6e4.png)\n\n![ss2.png](///raw/dd3/z/1c6e6.png)\n\n**TIPS** and details:\n* Some orders require a specific adjective like the *Beautiful Pet* having a \"Beautiful\" line in the screenshot immediately above. Though it's not entirely clear, there are 3 adjectives for the 3 primary attributes if that attribute is more than twice the next biggest, and another 3 adjectives for the pairs of attributes.\n* Mouse over the \"i\" in the lower right, or hold Shift, to show all tooltips for all Potions and Pets.  Clicking the \"i\" will toggle this on or off, which can be useful as you start wrangling a bunch of potions and pets at once.\n* There are diminishing returns when utilizing pets to feed your alchemical machinery - you get roughly log-base-2 back, however that is *after* splitting among how many outputs there are, so a Large creature with 6 strength will be split into 3 chunks of 2, each outputting 2, whereas a Small creature with 6 strength will just be one chunk, and only output 3.\n* The Final Potion requires 15+ in all attributes, so you may want to start building that one early\n* If the animations feel too slow to you, you can press and hold the mouse button or shift to speed them up.\n* You can right click to rotate pipes counter-clockwise.\n\n**Attributes Details**\n\nIgnore this for now, go play the game! But if you get confused trying to make a \"Ptn of Bloodlust\" or \"Golden Pet\", come back here for the details.\n\nThe three attributes, shown by the colors Pink(ish), Green(ish) and Blue(ish) are supposed to represent **Strength**, **Beauty** and **Magic** (though you're free to call them whatever you want ;).\n\nIn this table, A **>>** B means that A is \"much greater\" than B, that is to say, at least twice B, or it is 3+ more than B.  A **==** B means neither A **>>** B nor B **>>** A (both are approximately the same).\n\n| Adjective | Requirements | Color |\n| --------- | ------------ | ----- |\n| Strong or Strength | Strength **>>** others | Red |\n| Beautiful or Charisma | Beauty **>>** others | Green |\n| Magical or Sorcery | Magic **>>** others | Blue |\n| Wicked or Bloodlust | Strength **==** Beauty, both **>>** Magic | Yellow |\n| Ethereal or Charm | Beauty **==** Magic, both **>>** Strength | Cyan |\n| Fey or Fire | Strength **==** Magic, both **>>** Beauty | Purple |\n| Golden or Elixir | Strength **==** Magic **==** Beauty | Light Golden |\n\nI regret having orders that require specific attributes entirely, as how to get them are not clear in-game, and confuse people, the attributes should just have been used for flavor text, but too late for that now =).\n\n\n--\n\nTools Used\n* Custom Engine: [GLOV.js](https://github.com/Jimbly/glovjs-playground)\n* Mtn Dew\n* Photoshop\n* Audacity\n\nI, of course, planned on making other kinds of pets besides Slimes.

Any more and the first one will be removed.\n\n* Killing a monster will also sacrifice your item in your first slot.\n\n(Sorry about forgetting to write these things, it's my first compo and writing instructions is hard.)\n\n![cover image here](///content/7e/z/1c691.png)\n\n=============\n\n### Short Story\n\nYou, the player, has somehow find yourself in the middle of a dungeon full of monsters and items.\n\nYour goal is to leave the Dungeon alive through the stairs somewhere near the opposite corner.\n\n\n### Keys and instructions\n\nYour character :levitate: starts somewhere in the top left, and the exit is somewhere at the bottom right side of the dungeon. :door:\n\nUse the cursor keys to move around, if you try to go to a place with a monster then you'll have a fight.\n\nThe keys X and C can be used to cycle through your inventory; this is important because the first item in your inventory will be lost after a fight with a monster!\n\n\n### My first Compo game\n\nThis is my first Compo game, and I've done Ludum Dare for some time now.

I was unable to do any planning let alone actual coding until Sunday morning, with about 8 - 8.5 hours left on the clock. After some brainstorming I came up with a great idea for the theme! It was going to be a strategy puzzler game with some good depth to the mechanics. On paper it even sounds, to me, like a good game to continue working on after the jam for an official release. But obviously that was FAR out of scope for the time I had remaining in the compo.\n\nSo putting that idea into storage, I fell back to advice I heard about what to do if you can't come up with an idea. I decided to just create a clone of something really simple, and add some kind of mechanic to tie into the theme to make it not a straight clone. I wanted to go with a break out clone but after some more failed brainstorming on that I landed on Tetris. I'm not super satisfied with the add-on mechanic I came up with, but I am happy with just the fact that I got a reasonably finished product done in 8 hours. \n\nThe only things I really didn't have time to add were a simple theme tune and increasing difficulty, the game can get pretty challenging as it is so that might not be an issue.\n\nThanks to anyone who plays and rates the game, and thanks for reading!\n\n---","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ac6/3/z/1c76d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/lock-tris","author":{"name":"Durveg","uid":14026,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/durveg"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/Durveg/LockTris"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://durveg.itch.io/lock-tris"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Shepherd Sacrifice","category":"compo","description":"\nEdit: re-uploaded with the song looped\n\nSacrifice sheep to this creature, or kill em...\n![ShepherdsSacrifice Screenshot2.png](///raw/6e1/a1/z/1f263.png)\n\nControls:\nWASD        -move\nShift       -sprint\nMouse       -aim\nLeft click  -shoot\nRight click -push <---- this is your primary attack\nDon't forget to smile :p\n\n\nThere is some static in the beginning, didn't have time to re-record.\n\nForewarning, there is no win or lose condition, just a sandbox of sorts...\n\nHad to somewhat drastically change ideas at 24+ hour mark, but was able to use a bunch of the existing framework i had built.... eeeeeeek!","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//6e1/a1/z/1f25d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/shepherd-sacrifice","author":{"name":"aCuriosity","uid":106982,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/acuriosity"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//6e1/a1/z/1f263.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//6e1/a1/z/1f263.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://acuriosity.itch.io/shepherdssacrifice"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Desert island... or dessert island?","category":"compo","description":"A plane crashes near a desert island.

The way I implemented following the path around the mountain makes for some interesting jumps in some spots.  It shouldn't take long to get used to and you might not even notice it at all.  The hitboxes on the lava are a bit generous, so you can get pretty close before jumping.  Keep that in mind if you are having trouble making it over the lava.\n\n**Known Bugs**\n\nThere is a bug that prevents the game from loading on some computers.  I've fixed at least one cause of this, which is v2 in the Itch downloads.  If you get a message in the original version that says \"An exception has occurred\", please try v2.\n\nThere is also a bug that leaves black pixels on the screen.  This seems to be on non-Nvidia cards.  I uploaded v3 which should fix this issue.\n\n**Playthrough**\n\nBelow is a video playthrough of the game.  I highly recommend playing the game to experience it first hand, but this is here if you want it.\n\n[Playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czus8BG2Lz8)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c06/z/1c560.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/volcano-rush","author":{"name":"jharler","uid":1548,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/jharler"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c06/z/1c563.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c06/z/1c563.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c06/z/1c566.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c06/z/1c566.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c06/z/1c568.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c06/z/1c568.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c06/z/1c56a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c06/z/1c56a.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://jharler.itch.io/volcano-rush"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://jharler.itch.io/volcano-rush"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Necroprancer","category":"compo","description":"Platform on your own dead bodies!\n\n![necroprancer gif0 small.gif](///raw/3d3/4/z/1c62a.gif)\n\n![necroprancer gif1 small.gif](///raw/3d3/4/z/1c653.gif)\n\nMy best time is 1:23\n\nWhat's yours? :thinking:","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//3d3/4/z/1c671.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/necroprancer","author":{"name":"Blueman","uid":17363,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//3d3/4/z/4c58.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/blueman"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//3d3/4/z/1c62a.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//3d3/4/z/1c62a.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//3d3/4/z/1c653.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//3d3/4/z/1c653.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://blueman3612.itch.io/necroprancer"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/p83jtklddc2l93w/AABxdnIVFyxRW6vHH-b1PosNa?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Faces","category":"compo","description":"## Faces - Ludum Dare 43 - \"Sacrifices must be made\"\n\n[Play \"Faces\" online with WebGL!](http://departuregames.com/ludumdare43/)\n\n![FacesScreenshot.PNG](///raw/5ab/1/z/1c64d.png)\n\n![FacesScreenshot_Win.PNG](///raw/5ab/1/z/1c648.png)\n\n[Play \"Faces\" online with WebGL!](http://departuregames.com/ludumdare43/)\n\n### Project\nI finally had some time on a Ludum Dare weekend to participate!

I really struggled making even rudimentary low-poly meshes and especially texturing them. My hat's off to all the real 3D artists out there. I also really struggled with the theme this time. I didn't decide on my idea until about 15 hours into the Compo, and I'm still not sure the sacrifice thing really came through. I wanted to make the player feel like he was sacrificing the civilians, sometimes several, to keep one emergency vehicle alive. Time will tell if that comes across.    \n\n## Tools:\n\n* Unity\n* Blender\n* Inkscape\n* Audacity\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f05/1/z/1c63d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/perilous-passage","author":{"name":"Nick Rafalski","uid":5391,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/nick-rafalski"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f05/1/z/1c63e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f05/1/z/1c63e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f05/1/z/1c641.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f05/1/z/1c641.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f05/1/z/1c65f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f05/1/z/1c65f.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://nostyleguy.itch.io/perilous-passage"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://nostyleguy.itch.io/perilous-passage"},{"label":"Android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nostyleguy.perilouspassage"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","mobile"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Volcano Climber","category":"compo","description":"A small exploration of what it might be like to play a 2D sprite-based platformer in VR.\n\nThe \"game\" is really just a tech demo for procedural 1D heightmaps that are generated on the fly as the character runs around.

Repairing the ship when you are at 100% Hull and Engines will make the game unplayable. Besides there is no need to repair the ship if its at \"full health\" anyways.** :smile:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have been a space trucker for many years. Everyday you haul shipments which can save the life of those who need it. Unfortunately, for every life you save there are others that die. You can't save them all, so you have to decide who to sacrifice.\n\nWelcome to Mortal Decisions! A game of choices and sacrifice. Can you made the hard decisions when the time comes?\n\nIn this game you will be presented with your ships Log Screen and a View of your ship. A panel on the right will let you know how many credits you have, how much fuel you have and the health of your hull and engines. Your job is to earn 10000 credits so you can finally retire.\n\nBelow the Log Screen is the Contact Dispatch button. Use it to contact the dispatch where you can get a job, request a fuel ship or request a repair ship. When you request a job you will be presented with 2 options. The left option will be a job helping many people, the right option will be a job helping a single person. Choosing one job means the other job will not be completed and those people or that person will die.\n\nOnce you choose a job the Log Screen will let you know what stage you are at. There is a possibility you will encounter Space Pirates. If you do you have 2 options, you can try to outrun them or you can drop your cargo and flee. If you try to outrun them there is a chance the Space Pirates will damage your ship but if successful you will continue the delivery and will get paid. On the other hand if you drop the cargo, while you will get away unharmed you will lose the job and the payment.\n\nIf you run out of fuel, or your hull/engines get too damaged you will lose the game. Good Luck!\n\nThe escape key will bring up the pause menu which, pauses the game and allows you to change the volume of the music and sound.\n\nNOTES from the Author\n---------------------\n\nThis is a pretty chill game. I wanted to do something different this time around and I wanted to do something which use the Unity UI heavily. There isn't much action in the game but you do have decisions to make and you can lose. The game leans on some RNG which seems to favor the player. I tried to balance it but there is only so much you can do in 48 hours. \n\nAnyways, let me know what you think.\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d2/z/1c644.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/mortal-decisions","author":{"name":"KunoNoOni","uid":45,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d2/z/f26e.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/kunonooni"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/KunoNoOni/MortalDecisions"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://kunonooni.itch.io/mortal-decisions"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Food Chainz","category":"compo","description":"## Rhyming Roast 'em Up!\nThis is a game about challenging animals to rap battles for the right to roast and eat them, to summon and challenge the great God of Rap.\n\nProgress through 3 Dance Dance Revolution style rap battles, to prove your fire burns the hottest!\n\n![screenie.png](///raw/ee5/91/z/1c77e.png)\n\n## Playtime \nAbout 5-10 minutes\n\n## Features\n* 3 radical rap battles\n* 5 original beats\n* You can quite literally roast a fish in a rap battle\n* Unless you lose, the fish eats you then\n\n## Controls\n\n* WASD or arrow keys to move and rap\n* Space to interact with characters, and progress dialogue\n* Close the game to quit\n\n## Content warnings\n* **Implied cartoon violence** (screen jumps to black, an eating noise is heard, and when the screen returns an opponent is no longer there).

The stakes are constantly escalating, as new people are being poured into the world. Each carries a soul, and the killer of each gets all those souls (even the used ones), meaning the amount of souls ever only goes up. The AI also knows how to purchase upgrades for themselves, so there's a possibility you will eventually face someone much exceeding your own level of strength.  \nThe game is played on a 1km² map, and there are also some unarmed characters serving as easy pray.\n\n### Spectator Mode\nIf you get tired of that, you can go enjoy Spectator Mode, which is the same game, but you can fly around and see how everyone is squabbling. It's a lot of fun, and if you leave it running for long enough, you might just see some characters emerging as superior fighters, and thus the populations of those gods increasing.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cec/z/1c184.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/sacrifice-by-sword","author":{"name":"Torn","uid":3308,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/torn"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1REBvl9TCDwGJ8yoKPq9BqN16XFqYMPXr"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nW4AymWs2h7ksZ5JAffBSO5_HlBsQ2Lx"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NhAp7LjVqNokzalV_oRZWozabETOFBF6"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Humans Must Collide","category":"jam","description":"In this game you play as a lonely ghost.

But they are not evil -- they just ask for a sacrifice once every century.\n\nThe last one was 99 years ago.\n\nYour quest is to reach the Borks and to make the sacrifice and give humans one more century of existence. Legends say you may need to make other sacrifices on your way...\n\n![dogfight.jpg](///raw/61f/b/z/1f29d.jpg)\n\n**Instructions**\n\n* This is basically a plain and simple shmup: avoid collisions with other things, shot everything that moves.\n* You can equip your ship with different weapons and subsystems:\n    * Armor protects against all kinds of damage. As armor is lost, you cannot fix it (but you can replace it with a new armor if you find one).\n    * Shields protect against energy weapons (laser and plasma), but not against more physical damage (rockets and collisions). Shields regenerate over time.\n    * Engines make your ship move faster.\n    * You can find much better weapons than your initial Cheap Laser. You have a total of four weapon slots, but one of them (the bomb bay) is basically useless: bombs were forbidden by the Jupiter Convention and thus you'll not find any in the game. (Or do you think this is just an excuse for \"sorry, I didn't have time to implement bombs\"?!)\n* If you have available crew members, you can use them to man weapons and subsystems. Manned things work better (faster fire rate, lower armor damage, faster movement, etc)\n* To equip weapons and subsystems and to assign your crew to them, just enter in the pause/inventory menu.\n\n![inventory.jpg](///raw/61f/b/z/1f29e.jpg)\n\n* To find weapons, subsystems and crew members, just kill some enemies. Sometimes they drop the good stuff.\n* Notice that to take things dropped by enemies you need at least one available cargo slot. You can destroy things in the pause/inventory screen.\n\n![powerup.jpg](///raw/61f/b/z/1f2a0.jpg)\n\n* Once you get some of this gear, the game should be really easy. In fact, the first few minutes are much harder than the boss fights (which are ridiculously easy). I guess this is a symptom of bad balancing :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: \n\n![boss.jpg](///raw/61f/b/z/1f2a1.jpg)\n\n* Speaking of bosses, you cannot fight with the last level boss. He might look like an ordinary giant saucer, but in fact he is a Bork. If you a lamb on your cargo bays, you'll automatically sacrifice it and win the game. Otherwise, you'll automatically lose.\n* No biological lambs were harmed to make this game. The one you carry on your ship is a robotic one!\n\n![toll.jpg](///raw/61f/b/z/1f2a2.jpg)\n\n**Controls, in game**\n\n* Move ship: Arrows, WASD, controller D-pad, controller left stick\n* Fire: Space bar, alt, control, shift or the  main controller buttons; each one fires a different weapon\n* Pause/inventory screen: F1, pause on keyboard, pause  or start button on the controller\n\n**Controls, inventory screen**\n\n* Select item: Arrows, controller D-pad, controller left stick\n* For other actions there are on-screen instructions.

Let me explain you why...\n\n\n#---Tale of my 8th Ludum Dare---\n\n1. The theme: \n\n -History: I had a lot of idea with this theme, but I found my ideas too hard for one man and 48 hours. What I think about sacrafice? It's a moral deal for the player. The player can use something with his cons, or not. It's all about the deal of the player. So my ideas were complex role play games. In those case I couldn't implement the whole role role playing system in 48 hours, so I dropped my ideas.\n\n -Implement: It's a sadly thing, but my game doesn't contain too much from this theme. If are you looking for game with hard theme, it won't be your game. The story is the following: You are the mouse, who sacraficed him for the science :) You can't choose from the deals, only you suffer the bad ideas of your professor. The professor has an experiment about how can load you with useless/useful things, and what will be the result of his decide.\n\n2. Programing:\n\n -History: I would have liked to create a game with random dungeon generator (when you check my other games, you see I tried it, but those weren't too good). There are a lot of documentation about labirynth/dungeon generation on the Internet.\nFirst off all, what is the difference between labyrinth and dungeon? The labyrinth contains only paths, but the dungeon contains rooms, too. The most algorithms are using some of binary tree algorithm ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree ). When you generate a labyrinth, the meaning of the Mase solving algorithm can be useful for you, too ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_solving_algorithm ). What about dungeons? The dungeon algorithms are different because of you have to generate a lot of room, and generate some paths to them. That's all. Isn't it? No, It's not, because you need to solve these maps, too.\n\n -Implementation: I was looking for a good algorithm for that, and I found a great one. It's called BSP alorithm ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Basic_BSP_Dungeon_generation ). I used to draw the whole map from a matrix before, so I tought I generate a binary matrix with BSP, and draw it. It sounds easily. You have to know if you use recursive algorithm, that you can be in infinity loop, so if you can avoid a recursive call, you do it. Why is it important? Because if you generate 10 random sized rectangle in a 20*20 sized rectangle, you can't avoid the infinity loop in 100%. My statistic is 400/32... After I finished the algorithm, I realized that there is an another important question in case of random levels: The balance...\n\n3. Arts:\n -History: I had a \"good\" idea: if there are animations between the leveles, it will have more fun. I tought when those animations will have good pixel arts, and the levels have too, the game will be fine.\n\n -Implementation: I created 4 pictures (32x32) about a **** cheese and a mouse(100x200) in 5 hours (4819 pixels/hour)( No it's not the mouse of the cover image). The sadly truth is if I would like to create highly detailed pixel art animation for the videos(3-4 800*600 pictures * 3 video), the task is more than 1195 hours long (if there are the same arts, it will be success in 800 hours). The result looks good. I created 4 cheese, but I haven't time for backgrounds, especially for the game over screen... The \"videos\" are really static, and because of my poor english, I don't know that those are fine ore not.\n\n4. Music:\n -History: I don't like to create musics.\n -Implementation: There is a good silence with sfx. :)\n\n5. The Balance\n -History: The first idea is you can shop things from the professor, but all of the things have a price, because of that you suffer your decides. the As remember, I realized on Sunday, there is no chance to create an interactive system of decide. I tought, here is no goal, or barrier, so it's not a game. Can I balance a random generated map where the player can't decide? the answer is below. \n\n -Implementation: No. I created some goals for the random maps.

Especially when you are a farmer who tends a spiritually active plot of land!\n\nRaise crops and animals, collect natural resources like wood, coal, and metal, craft finished goods, upgrade animal pens and workshops, buy and sell to markets, and pay your taxes before the Taxman closes down your farm.\n\nOh yea, and make sure you are regularly sacrificing goods to the farm spirits if you want to be successful and gain their favor.\n\n### How to play:\n\nUse `WASD` to move your farmer, and arrow keys to face a direction without moving.\n`E` to interact with objects in the world (opens menus).\n`Esc` to open the pause menu and close menus.\n`1`-`6` to select menu options (options varies across menus).\n\nGrow crops, raise animals, harvest resources, and craft products to sell and sacrifice to the spirits. Spirits will meddle with your farm if they feel ignored too long, stealing animal feed, wrecking their shrines, or influencing your efficiency. Appease the spirits with relevant sacrifices to earn their favor, increasing efficiency and earning bonus harvests.\n\n![BST2.jpg](///raw/bd4/e/z/1c895.jpg)\n\nThe spirits aren't the only greedy and demanding force in your farm though, beware the Taxman! Pay his taxes regularly or he'll trigger a government seizure of your farm (and end your game!) if you miss his deadline. However, if you can manage to pay off his increasing taxes long enough, you'll earn a Tax Exempted status and no longer have to pay taxes on your farm (at least for the rest of your current play-through)!\n\n### Experience features such as:\n- Crop farming\n- Beekeeping\n- Animal Farming\n- Fishing\n- Mining\n- Crafting\n- Buying and Selling products\n- Sacrificing products to appease the spirits\n- Paying taxes\n\n![BST3.jpg](///raw/bd4/e/z/1c89d.jpg)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\nI unfortunately didn't have enough time to implement a title screen / main menu before the submission deadline.

You can attach multiple orbs to a tower, and doing so will increase the tower's attack strength and range.\n\nYou can then move orbs between towers, or indeed move them back to the Central Orb if need be. To move all orbs attached to a tower, left click and drag; to move a single orb, right click and drag.\n\nDo you sacrifice the strength of your tower arsenal, or the power of the Central Orb, in order to survive the longest, defeat the most enemies, and ultimately attain the greatest score? The choice is yours, but one thing is certain: sacrifices must be made!\n\n\n**_Important note:_** *I struggled to find enough time to dedicate to this project, so the game isn't as complete as I'd have liked it to be. Most notably, there's no audio, despite the fact that I actually did manage to create sprites for the sound button, which I then hid when I realised I wouldn't have time to implement any sounds.

Given the theme \"Sacrifices must be made\" I decided to have the player make sacrifices willingly as part of gameplay.\n\nYou play as a server admin, manually swapping servers around to process incoming data while protecting them from attacks. When a server crashes it will loose any data it recieves, and if you loose too much data you loose the game. In later levels, if you get overwhelmed, you can reject (block) incoming data, \"sacrificing\" the data to stay in the game.\n\n_(In hindsight, \"sacrifice\" is too strong a word, since it's just data. But the thought was there!)_\n\n\nOriginally I wanted to let you pick upgrades after processing certain amounts of data. Due to time restrictions I made levels instead where I gradually introduce each new mechanic. I tried to set spawn rates, win and loss conditions and server arrangements to give you a challenge while learning the new mechanic.\n\nThere could be some balancing issues due to lack of playtesting, but I hope you find the game both challenging and fun!\n\n\n_Made with Unity3D, Gimp and Bfxr._\n\n_Fonts are \"Atomic Clock Radio\" by PizzaDude.dk and \"Nine Pin\" by Digital Graphic Labs._","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//6d2/z/1c625.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/server-manager","author":{"name":"kraftkar","uid":726,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//6d2/z/c262.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/kraftkar"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//6d2/z/1d771.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//6d2/z/1d771.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://kraftkar.itch.io/server-manager"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"OhBall","category":"compo","description":"![QQ截图20181203082050.png](///raw/f42/31/z/1c9ae.png)\nHOW TO PLAY\n\n-  Hold down the mouse to save energy.\n\n-  Release the mouse rush to the direction of the mouse.\n\n-  A collision with an enemy will loses your HP and the enemy is injured\n\n-  When the ball's HP is lower than 6 and it was hit , it will be killed.\n\n-  When the bule ball hit enemy,  the enemy will be injured.\n\n-  Score points for defeating the enemy.\n\n-  Get higher score.\n\n![Background.png](///raw/f42/31/z/1c59c.png)\n\n![GIF.gif](///raw/f42/31/z/1ca4b.gif)\n\n\n![GIF1.gif](///raw/f42/31/z/1ca4d.gif)\n\n\n![GIF2.gif](///raw/f42/31/z/1ca52.gif)\n\n\n\nTOW LITTLE BALLS\n\n![Player_Point1.png](///raw/f42/31/z/1c52e.png)\n-  It can be picked up by you.\n\n\n![Point.png](///raw/f42/31/z/1c530.png)\n- It can be picked up by any ball.\n\nTHREE BIG BALLS\n![Enemy.png](///raw/f42/31/z/1c55c.png)\n-  When he is stronger than you, he wants to get close to you.\n\n\n![Enemy2.png](///raw/f42/31/z/1c55e.png)\n-  He wants to shoot you.\n\n\n![Enemy1.png](///raw/f42/31/z/1c55f.png)\n-  Maybe you should rush to him.\n\n-  He doesn't want any little ball.\n\n\n\nFINALLY\n-  Thanks for your playing.\n\n\n\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f42/31/z/1c85b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/ohball","author":{"name":"ManTou","uid":78415,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f42/31/z/1662f.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/mantou"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f42/31/z/1c9ae.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f42/31/z/1c9ae.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f42/31/z/1c59c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f42/31/z/1c59c.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f42/31/z/1ca4b.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f42/31/z/1ca4b.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f42/31/z/1ca4d.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f42/31/z/1ca4d.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f42/31/z/1ca52.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f42/31/z/1ca52.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f42/31/z/1c52e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f42/31/z/1c52e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f42/31/z/1c530.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f42/31/z/1c530.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f42/31/z/1c55c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f42/31/z/1c55c.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f42/31/z/1c55e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f42/31/z/1c55e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f42/31/z/1c55f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f42/31/z/1c55f.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://mantou.itch.io/ohball"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/nmantou/OhBall.git"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Castle Siege","category":"compo","description":"Send your units out to the castle.

And that is to make a multiplayer game involving networking.\n\nWhile the rest of game is somewhat lacking, and it's janky with Unity's matchmaker service sometimes, I have at least learned a lot about the Unity Networking layers and how to utilize them, even if a bit improperly. I already know what I would do differently and plan on using the next few weeks as a chance to exercise refactoring bad code into nice code.\n\nBut enough of that, here's my compo entry. You can, of course, run two side by side if no one is able to join you for matchmaking. Also, if you don't seem to enter a match properly, you'll have to close and retry. I have not yet figured out how to have Unity properly dispose of matches other than the normal \"wait a few seconds cleanup\" that they do, but players can be quicker than that. \n\n![Capture.PNG](///raw/44c/1/z/1c5ca.png)\n![Capture2.PNG](///raw/44c/1/z/1c5cc.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//44c/1/z/1c5b3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/blood-sacrifice","author":{"name":"monkeedude1212","uid":7236,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/monkeedude1212"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//44c/1/z/1c5ca.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//44c/1/z/1c5ca.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//44c/1/z/1c5cc.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//44c/1/z/1c5cc.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/monkeedude-software/LD43/SacrificeSource.zip"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/monkeedude-software/LD43/Sacrifice.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Coyote's Satiation","category":"compo","description":"The Goal of the game is to kill your detractors that are trying to sacrifice to the God Cayote \n\nControls: E to gather, click to shoot and Q to craft","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c78/1/z/1c57d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/coyotes-sacrifice","author":{"name":"boblova","uid":6268,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c78/1/z/4bb8.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/boblova"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/jr52n8anwyscm3b/LD%2043.Capx?dl=0"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/fd6d52ao28j7cnw/LD%2043.zip?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Fruit Blast","category":"compo","description":"![2018-12-03 11_48_01-Window.png](///raw/1c5/61/z/1ccf6.png)\n\nTake charge of a group of fruit astronauts that want to reach planet Fruit Loops, where all the other cool fruits live, of course.\n\nTry to reach the highest altitude you can, and collect coins on the way to buy upgrades for your ship and crew!\n\n![2018-12-03 11_47_06-Window.png](///raw/1c5/61/z/1ccf8.png)\n\nIf you find yourself low on fuel, don't worry!

So the primary goal is to get a steady supply of humans to sacrifice, which makes it hard to keep your farms going. But, with such few resources, you will likely have to sacrifice many pigs before you can increase your population.\n\n\n\n**About this Entry**\n\nThe game play is not well tweaked at the moment (never enough time).\n\nNone of the sound is mine, please download to view the sources.\n\n~~I did not make the four clipart images at the top (people, pig head, pile of logs, corn).\n~~All other graphics where made by me.

Sorry about that...\nR2 also fixed a couple of bugs which I doubt anyone would have noticed.\n\n\n**Edit: R3 released (Dec 3, 2018 6:25PM UTC-500)**\n\nCorrected starting resources. I modified them for testing, and then forgot to unmodify them.\n\n\n\n**How to play**\n\nI forgot to add how to play the game in game, so it is here instead... :expressionless:\n\n* Click on the little buildings in the center, to place them. Use them to generate resources.\n\n* Farms do not generate resources unless they are managed by someone. Click the plus icon on the buildings to add people to attend them. The icon will then indicate how many people are assigned to the farm.\n\n* Once a building has generated resources, a gold star will appear click it to gather the resources. **Important:** You can only gather as many pigs as you have corn for. So ensure you have enough corn when you click the Star\n\n* Build a Church to make sacrifices, human sacrifices are the best, but enough pigs will suffice.\n\n* Build Hovels to increase your population to sacrifice or tend your farms. **Note:** Your population is hungry, and with each event progression, those without pigs will die.\n\n* Build Tree Farms to produce wood to build more farms, hovels, or church's.\n\n* Build Corn Farms to support your pig production. Fortunately, pigs don't eat once they are \"gathered\".\n\n* Build Pig Farms to sustain your population and make sacrifices.\n\n\n\n**Play on Itch**\nhttps://bobleny.itch.io/sacrifices-ludum-dare-43","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//61e/f/z/1d475.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/sacrifices-must-be-made-ludum-dare-43","author":{"name":"great-bobleny","uid":65046,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/great-bobleny"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//61e/f/z/1d478.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//61e/f/z/1d478.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://bobleny.itch.io/sacrifices-ludum-dare-43"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=38480770085949338233"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Ludum Dare: The Game","category":"compo","description":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EZ34C0c5Fs\n\n**48 hours is not much.**\n\n**Choose carefully the features you will implement in your game.**\n\n**You might need to sacrifice some great ideas!**","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//387/1/z/1c7aa.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/ludum-dare-the-game-1","author":{"name":"pantoufle","uid":6019,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/pantoufle"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://maitrepantoufle.itch.io/ludum-dare-the-game"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/RemiFusade2/Ludum-Dare"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Pit of Zavghul","category":"compo","description":"![1543797336094.png](///raw/215/z/1c591.png)\n\nSurvive being thrown into the Pit of Zavghul as a sacrifice in this roguelike!

Play with the arrow keys.  Tab opens a menu when in-game.  Enter selects an item in menus.\n\nSmall advice: if you sacrifice the Rendering, press Tab, Down Arrow, and Enter, to open the menu and restart the level.\n\nFor some reason, Pyxel quits the game when you press Esc, so, don't do that :P\n\n(spoiler: there are two \"endings\" to this game, depending on the choices of sacrifice you made)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//bfc/1/z/1ce06.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/sacrifice-this-game","author":{"name":"xlambein","uid":7419,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//bfc/1/z/1ce39.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/xlambein"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/xlambein/ldjam43/archive/master.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"No time for everything ","category":"jam","description":"~Sometimes in our lives we have to sacrifice certain things in order to achieve others ~\n\nWe have made a game in which you must make decisions and decide which things to put aside.\n\nThe art of the game is made by programmers! \nWe hope you like it!\n\nPlay, enjoy and if you want to leave a comment.\n\nDevelopers:\n- Ricardo Roldan (@rickyrf95) programmer\n- Alejandro Benítez (@BenitezDev) programmer","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//eeb/f1/z/1c36c.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/no-time-for-everything","author":{"name":"BenitezDev","uid":130030,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/benitezdev"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://benitezdev.itch.io/no-time-for-everything"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sq028m4nNZdDdBsJ2KMmgrL8mXGnwK9s/view?usp=sharing"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/ricky395/ludumDare43"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Dungeon Clicker Crowler","category":"compo","description":"\nGame about crowling dungeon, cliking and discower resources.\n\n**Click door to break them or set units to do this.

It was a dark magic. He learned the spells that were supposed to be forgotten.  Blinded by the darkness he did the unthinkable - he sacrificed human lives to fuel his arcane powers. The kingdom captured this wizard and locked him in the deepest dungeon. \n\nBut the wizard couldn't be contained for any longer. *You* cannot be contained. ESCAPE THE DUNGEON!\n\n## 👓 Overview\nThere are 5 levels. You don't have to beat them in a sequential order, so you can try all of them easily. \n\n## 📒 RULES\n**1. All doors are locked, break them using magic!**\n\n**2. Magic requires charges, which are obtained by slaying enemies with a dagger.**\n\n🎧 Headphones recommended, since you can hear enemies walking around the corner.\n\nPlease rate and leave a review.

Anyways, you'll surely find the 800 hours of thrilling GaymePlay(trademark pending) worth the price tag of 0.001 yes thats right I take one tenth of a cent from the poor every time someone downloads this game HAHAHAHHA.

Our weapons are useless against those invading monsters, but there is still hope! We found that the Astra have strange reactions when getting close to the dark creatures. It's a risky effort, but I'm afraid we've run out of options. This is our last chance to push them back!\n\nYour loyal Astra have entrusted you with their lives to help you save the kingdom. You must work with your loyal Astra and save our home!\n\nKing's Last Stand is a game where you take the lead of the Astra creatures to repel the invading creatures. Take advantage of these explosive little cuties to take out groups of enemies and clear each wave till the end!\n\nBut how many of these cute Astra must be sacrificed to win this war?\n\n## Tips\n\nA lot of people seem to have trouble beating the game, mainly due to the difficulty of Wave 7!\nHere are a few tips to be able to successfully complete it and save the Astera kingdom!\n1. Astra self-destruct when contacting the enemy for too long! That means that your Astra will protect you from behind, so make sure to send them flying ahead of you to secure a safe path!\n2. Running away and herding them into groups is the most efficient way to use the Astra!\n3. There is no way to avoid being damaged in Wave 7 multiple times in the beginning as you are mobbed. Make sure to maintain enough Health Points from previous waves so that you can last through the initial mob!\n4. Your enemies are always walking towards you. Your enemies also can't don't spawn near your castle in the south. Use that information to your advantage to group the enemies in the start of each wave in an advantageous spot! It's easier to get surrounded if you stay too close to the castle!\n\n## Updates\n\n12/03/2018\n- Fixed the rest time that should happen between each wave.\n- Fixed a bug where a few enemies were still visible after winning the game.\n- Added Windows, Mac, and Linux Build\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2b7/e1/z/1c4a7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/kings-last-stand","author":{"name":"Pukami","uid":124850,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2b7/e1/z/1af23.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/pukami"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2b7/e1/z/1c4f0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2b7/e1/z/1c4f0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2b7/e1/z/1c57b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2b7/e1/z/1c57b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2b7/e1/z/1c4f2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2b7/e1/z/1c4f2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/AustinPuk/Sacrifices_LD43"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://pukami.itch.io/kings-last-stand"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://pukami.itch.io/kings-last-stand"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://pukami.itch.io/kings-last-stand"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://pukami.itch.io/kings-last-stand"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Final Flight of STS Recovery","category":"compo","description":"![2018-12-02 (7).png](///raw/9e4/z/1c4cf.png)\n![2018-12-02 (4).png](///raw/9e4/z/1c4d5.png)\n![2018-12-02 (3).png](///raw/9e4/z/1c4d4.png)\n\n\nYou have been sent to Mars to recover a damaged science probe that Is stranded on the planet.

You are responsible for defusing all the bombs that rebel forces have planted in your city over the course of a week. You are able to defuse bombs yourself, but you can't get to all the bomb sites in time, so you must send out members of your team. To send them out is to risk their lives, however. And if you don't think they can diffuse the bomb before the timer ticks down to 0, you can choose to sacrifice them. They will immediately stop diffusing the bomb, and attempt to drive it out of the city, resulting in the fewest civilian casualties possible. This will of course sacrifice one of your officers.\n\nActually managed to get sound for this one!

But, at the end I found that my browser tab was muted... \n* Secondly, when I was implementing simple audio ques in the editor, the thrust sound was working fine (that's the terrible placeholder sound you are hearing) but I could not figure out why explosion sounds would not work, neither with PlayOneShot() nor with normal Play(). The sound is not corrupted and would play in some specific cases.\n\nAnyway, because of all of this I left the audio for the end and I only figured out the muted tab mistake minutes before deadline. And vualia, now it's even worse than no sound because it has a terrible thrust placeholder :D \n\nIf you want to play it as it was intended, mute the tab and listen to a Synthwave mix. suggestion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXZUpO2t5WM","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//5db/e1/z/1c3cd.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/destination-mars","author":{"name":"Cricket","uid":125909,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/cricket"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//5db/e1/z/1c3ac.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//5db/e1/z/1c3ac.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//5db/e1/z/1c3af.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//5db/e1/z/1c3af.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//5db/e1/z/1c3b2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//5db/e1/z/1c3b2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//5db/e1/z/1c456.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//5db/e1/z/1c456.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"htt://bitbucket.org/daliusgr/ldjam43/src/master/"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://dalius.itch.io/destination-mars-ldjam43"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dalius.itch.io/destination-mars-ldjam43"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Kamikaze","category":"jam","description":"[logo]: ///content/b1a/f/z/1c4a0.png\n\n![logo]\n\n\nI'm sending this version of the game first because this game was also supposed to be for a competition in my town. **Wish me luck.**\n  \n\nI didn't go for compo because the music that is on the game is not mine.

Use the mouse on the main menu, ESC to exit to the menu, and R to restart from the last checkpoint. No save files.\n\nOverall, I'm extremely pleased with the results of my first Ludum Dare. Have fun.\n\n![cover.JPG](///raw/355/d1/z/1c4c1.jpg)\n![9 progress.JPG](///raw/355/d1/z/1c4be.jpg)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//355/d1/z/1c3f1.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/temple-of-the-blood-god","author":{"name":"ZanyG","uid":120147,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/zanyg"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//355/d1/z/1c4c1.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//355/d1/z/1c4c1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//355/d1/z/1c4be.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//355/d1/z/1c4be.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://zanyg.itch.io/temple-of-the-blood-god"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Sacrifice^3","category":"compo","description":"![Screen Shot 2018-12-02 at 8.29.21 PM.png](///raw/d7a/z/1c477.png)\n\nUse arrows to move.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d7a/z/1c485.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/sacrifice3","author":{"name":"simonhutchinson","uid":2685,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d7a/z/2b8d.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/simonhutchinson"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d7a/z/1c477.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d7a/z/1c477.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/ozfph40vdq56g1a/Sacrifice%20%28LD43%29.zip?dl=0"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://simonhutchinson.itch.io/sacrifice3"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://simonhutchinson.itch.io/sacrifice3"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://simonhutchinson.itch.io/sacrifice3"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://simonhutchinson.itch.io/sacrifice3"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Fuite / Escape","category":"compo","description":"# Fuite\n\nA game where you have to escape... but will everybody make it? :rocket: \n\n**Controls**:\n- LMB and RMB on hums to control them.\n- R to restart the current level.\n\n### Post-LD update\nThere is [a post-LD update](https://github.com/totorigolo/fuite-rs/releases/tag/0.2.0) available which tries to address all your comments :slight_smile: Here are the changes:\n- Level 2, the comment is now: \"LMB, RMB or R to restart\".\n- New level that showcases how to make a useful sacrifice.\n- The last level is now more difficult.\n- New game over message.\n- Some other small improvements/tweaks to levels.\n- For touchpad users, you can use Space+Click for right click.

I have finished my first LUDUM DARE!\n\nThe game is on the short side, but there is a nice small adventure. At the start my idea was that you were a slime that would have to squeeze through passages smaller than yourself by shedding slime, or sacrificing it. Eventually that turned into putting your slime into pits to get across.\n\nI know that this game is not fool proof, but it's short enough that exiting and restarting will not give you too much of a setback.\n\nMy favorite part of this jam would have been figuring out how to select a custom color via player input. I was probably a lot happier than I should have been, but I was determined to get my cyan slime and it was a satisfying conclusion!\n\nMy biggest regret is how much I slept, as I think I could have finished a lot more if I shaved 4-5 hours off my slumber. Though it may be the other way around if I did take the cut haha.\n\nI look forward to checking out what everyone else has created!\n\n\nSide note:\nI had some troubles uploading to GitHub. I believe everything is there, but if anything is missing, I can see if I can get it uploaded, or I can dropbox the project if necessary. \n\nKnown bug: if a single horizontal direction is held going through a door, occasionally the player will become unaligned with the regular path. This doens't break the game but it will stop progress.

So you first start off as a one man army against the entire opposing enterprise, however whenever you die, something awesome happens. A new character will spawn, and he will do all the exact same actions you did before you died. Now you have an ally, and you can also control a new player. Now you can keep going in this cycle, building up an army till you can take down the El Juan Enterprise.\n\n## How does this link to the theme?\n\nThis is related to the theme as you have to die (sacrifice yourself) in order to progress the game forward, sometimes the only option is to die in order to move forward...

So hopefully it runs smoothly now. I have also added a skip tutorial button so you don't have to run it each and every time you start the game. The sacrifice button won't work if there are anymore than 2 cubes in the sacrifice area. \n\nThis is my first ever ludum dare. I definitley overscoped and didn't touch on hardly anything I originally planned. Happy to get out a working game though.\n\nThe game will take ages if you don't sacrifice your evolved cubes/animals. The more evolved they are the more they are worth! Some colours are also worth much more than others.\n\nYou can select a cube by left clicking or clicking and draging to select more than one. You can also hold shift while clicking to select more than 1 cube at a time. To move a cube/cubes while selected click the right mouse button. \n\nStarting off with simple blue cubes, can you evolve it into 8 different species?\n![MainScreen.png](///raw/61f/c1/z/1cc4f.png)\n\nNOTE (Change Log): I have fixed the bug where 2 cubes being squished before the tutorial says so bugs out the game. The altar will not work in the initial press unless only 1 cube is on it. Also a minor fix with some of the cubes not evolving to the correct coloured animal.\n\nThere has been quite a few bugs with my horribly created tutorial! haha I will definitely be testing a lot more then next time I do something similar! I have added a check button at the top left of the screen just in case the tutorial bugs out. That way you can still at least continue the game.\n\nI have rescaled the points system. Big thanks to @evogengames for pointing out if you added all the cost to evolve there really wasn't much benefit to sacrificing the more evolved animals. It's much more of a benefit now to squish those beautiful creatures :smile: \n\nThanks for heads up :smile: I have updated the sourcecode as well so the change can be seen in Bitbucket.\n\n**SPOILER (how to get all the different colours):**\n- The easiest way to get all the colours is to mix every colour with blue.\n- 2 blues make yellow.\n- 1 blue 1 yellow make green.\n- 1 blue 1 green makes purple.\n- etc.\n\nThere are many other different ways to make all the colours as well if you prefer to try and figure them out :smile: \n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//61f/c1/z/1c387.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/evolve","author":{"name":"Amanda Priest","uid":118550,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/amanda-priest"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//61f/c1/z/1cc4f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//61f/c1/z/1cc4f.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://stumpybean.itch.io/evolve"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://bitbucket.org/Manda86/ludumdare43/src/master/"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://stumpybean.itch.io/evolve"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://stumpybean.itch.io/evolve"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Necromancer","category":"compo","description":"How to play:\n- use the basic attack to turn the attacking hero's into undead servants\n- these undead servants can act as distractions or as shields for your protection.\n- once enough undead servants have been made you can sacrifice them to cast more powerful magic\n- 5 Souls, heal 25 points of damage\n- 10 Souls, increase the damage done by basic attack\n- 20 Souls, lightning Bolt Area of Effect\n\nBrief Post-Mortem(ish):\n\nI've been following LD for some time but have never competed before this event.

Using multiple traits in each cure is a requirement later on in the game.\n\nKeep the world's population alive and make sure you don't kill too many test subjects...\n\nThanks for playing my second Ludum Dare game!","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7a7/d/z/1c35c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/the-cure","author":{"name":"PinballJunior","uid":55207,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7a7/d/z/1b1a9.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/pinballjunior"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7a7/d/z/1c370.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7a7/d/z/1c370.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7a7/d/z/1c375.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7a7/d/z/1c375.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7a7/d/z/1c377.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7a7/d/z/1c377.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7a7/d/z/1c37a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7a7/d/z/1c37a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7a7/d/z/1c37b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7a7/d/z/1c37b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7a7/d/z/1c405.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7a7/d/z/1c405.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://pinballjunior.itch.io/the-cure"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://pinballjunior.itch.io/the-cure"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://pinballjunior.itch.io/the-cure"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"101 Ways to Die in Alpha Complex","category":"compo","description":"![ac_ss001.gif](///raw/c1/z/1c2d4.gif)\n\nHello Citizens!

The evil Morpher will destroy the world if not stopped in time. In dire times like these, there is only one man the world can depend on. Coinman! Coinman has the \"power\" to have his health linked to the amount of money he has. Coinman must use well placed coins to distract enemies, light the path ahead, and defeat his foes. It may seem counter-productive for Coinman to be killing himself only to gain a ranged weapon, but sacrifices must be made.\n\n💎 Playing The Game 💎\n\nIn Coinman, you can explore the dungeons that the Morpher is rumored to reside in. Along the way, you will fight 7 different types of enemies. In order to fight these enemies, you must use your sword and coins. The sword is a melee weapon, while the coins function as a ranged weapon. Don't be too hasty in using your coins though, because your wealth and your health are one and the same. In each room there is a chest which will spew healing coins when it is opened, however it won't budge until defeat all the enemies in its room. As you explore, the enemies will get harder, a sure sign you are getting closer to the Morpher.\n\n\n🎮 Controls 🎮\n\nWSAD - Movement\n\nLeft Click - Swing Sword/Navigate Menus\n\nRight Click - Throw Coin\n\nMouse - Aim\n\nF - Toggle fullscreen\n\nPROTIP - Chests will only open after you have defeated all of the enemies in their room.\n\nPROTIP 2 - Instead of hitting enemies with your coins, try missing! Enemies might go out of their way to get a coin instead of you.\n\n📷 Screenshots 📷\n\n![Capture1.PNG](///raw/2c7/c/z/1c2f6.png)\n\n![Capture3.PNG](///raw/2c7/c/z/1c2f9.png)\n\n![Capture4.PNG](///raw/2c7/c/z/1c2fa.png)\n\n![Capture5.PNG](///raw/2c7/c/z/1c2fc.png)\n\n![Capture6.PNG](///raw/2c7/c/z/1c2fe.png)\n\n\n\n\n![57d5ad4ae65b502d0ea3564dd45e4151.png](///raw/2c7/c/z/1c300.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2c7/c/z/1c342.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/coinman","author":{"name":"Untitled Studios","uid":51138,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/untitled-studios"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2c7/c/z/1c2b3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2c7/c/z/1c2b3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2c7/c/z/1c2f6.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2c7/c/z/1c2f6.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2c7/c/z/1c2f9.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2c7/c/z/1c2f9.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2c7/c/z/1c2fa.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2c7/c/z/1c2fa.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2c7/c/z/1c2fc.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2c7/c/z/1c2fc.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2c7/c/z/1c2fe.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2c7/c/z/1c2fe.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2c7/c/z/1c300.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2c7/c/z/1c300.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/198lmvJEiQr87gU6aTsvKTgTitSOhRL7H/view?usp=sharing"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WF7AwrD_r_UcXUeAUkxGeeNpc8zgCm7c/view?usp=sharing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Spirit Desperate","category":"compo","description":"Despair is upon us!\n\nOne day, you and your fellow spirits are attacked by monsters of darkness.\nYour best bet for survival,\nis to sacrifice your friends,\nand throw them as Spirit Bombs towards the monsters!\n\n![ss3.PNG](///raw/9d6/8/z/1c30f.png)\n![ss4.PNG](///raw/9d6/8/z/1c31a.png)\n\nControls (Default):\n\nMove: WASD   \nMelee Attack: LMB   \nRanged Attack: RMB (Unlocked after clearing the 3rd level)   \nMechanics clarification: The blue bar represents your 'karma' which acts as your defense (you take more damage the less karma you have).

And your intergalactic space yacht is in desperate need of fuel: Virgins. Yep, you read that right. Those ancient civilizations knew that sacrificing virgins was a sure-fire way to fuel their empires. Why not fuel your space yacht?\n\nSpace Virgins marks my fourth entry into the Ludum Dare Competition! When making games, my goal tends to create something that works on both a PC and my Android phone. So, to that end, you need nothing more than your finger/mouse to play!\n\nThe goal is simple, sneak onto a ship and abscond with 10 Space Virgins without being caught. Do mind the holes though.\n\n---\n\n## How To Play\n- Drag your mouse around the screen to move\n- Ram yourself into not one, not two, but **TEN** space virgins\n- Get yourself to Mars... err... the **EXTRACTION POINT**\n- Sacrifice those Space Virgins in **YOUR SPACE YACHT** fuel system, not some other random schmo's ship\n\n---\n\n## Developer Notes:\n\nFor this Jam, I focused on taking a deeper dive into the Unity Physics2D Joint, TextMesh Pro and Sprite systems.

Your goal is to destroy the monstrous BLIGHT TOWER! Stand under OUTPOSTS to capture them and spawn an army of DEADLY CAPSULES! Be warned, the BLIGHT TOWER has a powerful BLAST ATTACK that does heavy damage and turns your DEADLY CAPSULES against you! Don’t die! \n\nSo where's the incorporation of the 'Sacrifice' theme, you ask? Simple: If you find yourself running low on HEALTH, shoot rockets at a nearby DEADLY CAPSULE. There's a chance it will drop HEALTH for you upon death. Be advised, running out of DEADLY CAPSULES will lose you the game!\n\nIf you’ve played a shooter in the 20 [twenty] years, you’ll pick this up no problem. Otherwise, it’s W, A, S, and D to move, mouse to aim, and left click to shoot your shot.\n\nFull disclosure: While the game is technically feature complete, I ran out of time to work on my wishlist of audio and visual deliverables (note: the DEADLY CAPSULES). Many assets are still placeholders. There are also several bugs, as of writing. I ran out of time before I could get them fixed. I have opted out of the Audio category, as the only sound in the game is for the rocket launcher. I have also opted out of the Humor category as it doesn’t fit the theme of the game. I did opt into graphics as the models are custom made and the level design is (mostly) done.\n\n\nAll this to say, I pushed myself more than any other Ludum Dare yet. My project scope was more than I could handle in the end, but I’m still incredibly proud of the results.

The Head Spinners believe in the Spinning God and it demands a daily spinning sacrifice! Because their heads are the only thing spinning in this world, they are sacrificing themselves. And they love it!\n\nYour job is to keep the society of Head Spinners running, eventhough every two ingame days one Head Spinner must be sacrificed.\n\nThe games are short and have no end state - except losing. When you figure out how to keep the society running, there will no be additional challenge.\n\nI'm looking forward to your feedback :-)\n\n![2018-12-03-ld-screenshot2.png](///raw/2dd/z/1cb84.png)\n\n## How To Play\n- Move Camera: WASD, Arrow Keys or clicking middle or right mouse button.\n- Camera Zoom: Mouse Wheel, or Q and E.\n- Select and Build: Left Mouse Click. Unselect: Right Mouse Click.\n- Build resource extraction buildings to automatically harvest wood, stone and food. But the resources are finite!\n- Every Head Spinner consumes one food at the end of the day. Don't let them starve!\n- Building *Reproduction Caves* will create a new Head Spinner. But they are expensive and take long.\n- Build homes to accommodate more Head Spinners.\n- Every two days the **Almighty Spinning God** demands sacrifice. And the Head Spinners love it! You select the chosen one. Keep in mind that you will lose a Head Spinner every two days.\n- You lose when all your Head Spinners are dead or sacrificed.

Simply download the windows build and execute the .exe with the [Mono Runtime](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/). The linux build contains a Mono Runtime and is therefore so much bigger.\n\nThe assets are created with **PyxelEdit**, **ChipTone**, **Bosca Ceoil**.\n\nYou can easily adjust the **resolution** and fullscreen settings in the Content/config.xml file.\n\n or download the linux build that contains the runtime.

If you really need to, you can go to browser console (f12 or ctrl+shift+i on most browsers), input `localStorage.setItem(\"aidf-level\", 0)` and refresh the page.\n\n## Rules clarifications\n\n### Jumping\n\nJump destination cannot be rock, hole, crate, bush or (if you already picked up the blue orb) water. \n\nJump origin cannot be water.\n\nYou perform a jump whenever you make a movement which you cannot perform, you are not standing in water and there is possible jump destination behind it.\n\n### Pushing crates\n\nCrates cannot be pushed onto orbs. When you can either jump over the crate or push it, you always push it. This is not a bug.\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//194/z/1c1ab.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/an-adventure-within-a-deep-forest","author":{"name":"BoltKey","uid":1169,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/boltkey"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//194/z/1c16d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//194/z/1c16d.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://boltkey.cz/aidf/"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/BoltKey/awdf/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Was there a point...

As with any nascent and struggling cult, you must manage the happiness of your cultists while keeping the faith in your cult strong and out of the eyes of the local authorities. And when you are ready to begin the ritual, start tossing your cultists into the sacrificial pit. \n\nThe game does not take long to play, and it is my first LD submission. My goal was to create a complete experience, a manageable project, have simple interactions, and be in a style that I enjoy. The visuals should lighten the dark theme of sacrificing your beloved followers, and nothing in the game ever takes itself too seriously. I tend to enjoy worker-placement board games which influence the basic mechanics of Eldritchual. Oddly, I'm not normally a fan of the Lovecraft horror genre, but this theme and other games and movies I've watched recently just led me there. \n\nWhile there are additional mechanics, polishing, and balancing that I would have liked to include, I made difficult cuts to try to stay on time. \n\nPlease enjoy Eldritchual!\n\n### How to Play\n- Click and Drag to move cultists around. \n- ESC to pause the game and review the tutorial. \n- Sacrifice cultists to progress the ritual!\n\n### Eldritual Game Window\n![SS1.png](///raw/ada/e1/z/1c2c5.png)\n\n### Sample Tutorial Screen\n![SS2.png](///raw/ada/e1/z/1c2ca.png)\n\n### Page Edits\n- *Edit: Moved source to GitHub for future work.

Objects, plants, animals and even humans. You should reach the sacredness limit to complete the ritual. However, it is hard to keep every sacrifice happy. And sad sacrifices mean less sacredness. \n\nSacrifice Management is a mouse-only puzzle game. Just move sacrifices to the altar. Oppositely, you can remove sacrifices from the altar by moving them outside. Each sacrifice has a sacredness point (SP). You own a sacrifice’s SP when you place it on the altar. On the other hand, sacrifices may have a love and a hate list. If a sacrifice is placed adjacent to another one on its love list, its SP increases (not permanently, only for that positioning - base SP never changes). Similarly, hate decreases SP. You pass the level when you reach the level’s sacredness limit.\n\nSince levels are generated by an algorithm, you may experience very easy or absurd levels. The first 4-5 levels were intentionally designed as easy. After level 13, it becomes more challenging.\n\n![ss2.png](///raw/e13/8/z/1c1a5.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e13/8/z/1c1be.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/sacrifice-management","author":{"name":"Aycan","uid":33566,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e13/8/z/4b21.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/aycan"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e13/8/z/1c19f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e13/8/z/1c19f.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e13/8/z/1c1a5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e13/8/z/1c1a5.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://github.com/aycansblx/SacrificeManagement"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://aycan.itch.io/sacrifice-management"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Foreign Planet","category":"compo","description":"[![Screenshot.PNG](///raw/751/z/1c1bd.png)](https://rialgar.github.io/LD43/index.xhtml)\n\n[Play here](https://rialgar.github.io/LD43/index.xhtml)\n\n[Source](https://github.com/Rialgar/LD43)\n\nYou have landed on a foreign planet.

Win the game by raising sacrifice level to 100 and not dying. 😁\n\n:keyboard: In short:\n* WASD: Move around\n* E: Pick up chicken / Drop chicken\n* SPACE: Attack when not carrying chicken/ Throw chicken when carrying one\n\n![1.png](///raw/d47/d/z/1c282.png)\n![2.png](///raw/d47/d/z/1c284.png)\n![3.png](///raw/d47/d/z/1c285.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d47/d/z/1c1df.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/the-chickening","author":{"name":"Ryvencore","uid":55117,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d47/d/z/f144.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/ryvencore"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d47/d/z/1c282.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d47/d/z/1c282.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d47/d/z/1c284.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d47/d/z/1c284.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d47/d/z/1c285.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d47/d/z/1c285.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://bitbucket.org/ryvencore/the-chickening/src/master/"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://ryvenier.itch.io/the-chickening"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Yield","category":"compo","description":"## Description​\n\n'Yield' is a simple platformer were you sacrifice yourself to reach the goal in your next life.\n\n![Gameplay1.gif](///raw/f75/c/z/1c164.gif)\n\nI didn't have that much time this LD so I settled for something simpler :).\n​\n \n## Controls\nMove - AWSD / Arrow keys / Left Joystick                    \nJump - Space / A button                          \nRestart - 'R' / B button                 \nSacrifice - Left Ctrl / Left Shift / Enter / Y button                \n\n_Controllers are supported_","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f75/c/z/1c1d8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/yield","author":{"name":"Swen","uid":50559,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f75/c/z/91da.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/swen"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f75/c/z/1c164.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f75/c/z/1c164.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://insertcoffee.itch.io/yield"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://insertcoffee.itch.io/yield"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/swenmeeuwes/ludum-dare-43"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Honey for Aponuo","category":"compo","description":"Honey for Aponuo is a text adventure, written in inform7.\n\nIt’s playable on the web.

Fighting him is really hectic.\n\n-If you fight the element, you can weaken Grimmvich by removing his attacks.\n\n-However, since the \"elements are unstable\", if you fight the elements, all their respective objects in the world (e.g. campfires or trees) lost their color.\n\n-Also, the music consists of four sub-tracks, and each element has a track associated with it. If you defeat an element, its music stops playing.\n\n-If you fight all four elements, there will be no sound and everything will be black and white. When you go to fight Grimmvich, he will have no attacks, and cannot hurt you.\n\n-There are different endings depending on if fight any elements, or defeat Grimmvich at full power\n------\n\nV 1.1 (4/12): Fixed typos, increased player attack speed and boss health.

The twist is that part of your ship is destroyed upon landing. \n## Gameplay\nThe Game has two possible stages:\n1. Flight\n2. Planetary stationing\n\nGoing from planetary to flying can be done for free, by pressing the launch button. Flight to planetary costs you dearly; one layer of your ship gets destroyed.\n\n\n## Flying\nWhen on the flight screen, you can click around your ship (the red dot in the middle of the screen) to set the direction of the next burn.\n\nThe slider on the side is used to set how quickly the ship should burn it's fuel. There's a button to set the burn speed to zero.\n\nUse the 1-5 keys to set the simulation speed, and use the spacebar to set the simulation speed to zero.\n\nIf you're near enough to a planet, the landing button will appear. There's no penalty to speed differences nor position differences, the landing computer on your ship ensures a decent landing. Well, not really decent, but still.\n## Landing\nWhen landing, you have to choose which direction will enter the atmosphere first. Every part of your ship that's exposed from that side will burn, and you will lose those parts.\n## Ship Control\nShip Control is used to enable and disable specific parts of the ship. It serves little purpose within this version of the game.\n\n## Planetary\nThe planetary screen is a screen from which multiple other screens can be reached. It can also be used to launch the ship again.\nYou can reach the following screens from the planetary screen:\n1. Edit Ship\n2. Buy\n3. Sell\n4. Refuel\n\n## Edit Ship\nThis screen is used to add parts to your ship.  There's no punishment to removing and re-adding parts.\n\n## Buy\nThis screen is used to buy cargo. You click the cargo type you want, and then the cargo bay in which you want to place it.\nEvery time you buy something, the price goes up by fifty.\n## Sell\nThis screen is used to sell cargo.

Shooting your only weapon will eventually be your downfall, yet staying put and playing defense will get you nowhere. Death will not fall upon your enemies unless you command it, yet your command is limited. The only way forward is through in this lighting fast bullet hell shooter.\n\n\"Sacrifices Must Be Made\"\n---\n\nThe ammunition in your gun is your life, a concept which makes for some interesting game play decisions. My first idea for the game after the theme was announced was to have this be the only sacrifice you make in a play of the game, but while I was brainstorming and planning my schedule, I came up with several other ideas. None of them really would've stood on their own, but it seemed awfully ambitious to try and put them all neatly into one game in under 48 hours. \n\nNonetheless, that's what I did. The game linked on this page is a boss rush shooter game with all the following concepts put - Not too shabbily, either, I'd say - in it:\n\n-The ammo in your gun is your health.\n\n-You can't kill all your enemies, you have to choose wisely which ones you do.\n\n-One benefit can be traded for another. In this case, one opportunity to kill a boss (referred to as \"Fatalities\"), can be \ntraded for two extra clips in you HP gun, and vice versa.\n\n-Every boss you don't use a Fatality on will be put in a cage, where you can't fight it and it can't fight you. After every fifth round, all the caged enemies will be released and their HP restored. Now defeating them will kill them, no matter your number of remaining fatalities.\n\n![Base Profile Screenshot 2018.12.02 - 11.46.12.54.png](///raw/d8f/51/z/1bd6d.png)\n\n---\nCredits:\n---\n\nAll assets, game design, music/sound design, and programming was done by yours truly\n\nGame assembled/programmed in GameMaker: Studio 2\n\n(Assets were designed in the GM:S2 image editor)\n\nMusic made in Ableton Live 10 Intro\n\nSound FX made in BFXR","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d8f/51/z/1bca1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/the-gunslinger","author":{"name":"Jasper Hansen","uid":89997,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d8f/51/z/1438c.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/jasper-hansen"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d8f/51/z/1bd6d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d8f/51/z/1bd6d.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_85GSWqZWVMZliaNy9gRU5-bt9BOZbP0"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://jasperh.itch.io/the-gunslinger"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Finding the Lamb","category":"compo","description":"![banner.png](///raw/a54/e1/z/1cd77.png)\n\n**The signs are unmistakable: the end is coming.**\n\nAs the leader of the faith, you must prevent the apocalypse by identifying which of your followers is The Lamb, and offering them as a sacrifice.\n\nAiding you are three unknowable spirits; two of which will aid you, while one will seek to deceive.

I'll definitely be coming back to compete in the next jam!\n\nTo run the game, download the executable from GitHub and extract from the ZIP archive. Run the file 'Apollo.exe' and all should hopefully work :smile:\n\n### Gameplay\n\nIn Apollo you pilot a rocket ship through a field of debris, meteors and alien ships. You need to dodge these obstacles, however moving the rocket sacrifices your limited fuel supply! The goal is to last as long as possible.\n\nMeteors can crash into your ship, while alien ships will shoot lasers at you. Once you have taken damage, you will start to leak oxygen.\n\nThe ship is in space, so there it has inertia of course. There's no friction to slow it down automatically!\n\nThe game is over when the ship explodes, you suffocate to death or run out of fuel. Good luck!\n\n### Controls\n\nUsing A/D or LEFT/RIGHT arrows to control the ship.

Once again it was nice to go a bit more art focused (still crappy programmer art though lol) instead of working myself up over code. My 4th Ludum Dare submission and definitely not my last! Would love to get some feed back and would be great if you guys tried it out and told me what you think.\n\n\n**What is the game?**\n\nThe game is about driving your bus as far as you can by managing resources and making decisions based on events that will determine the survival of your 20 passengers. Do you stay and fight the hordes of zombies and bandits to perhaps loot some more resources like food or fuel for the road, or do you speed off in an attempt to not risk losing what little you have.\nCurrently there are about 10 different possible random events, 5 of witch have multiple outcomes. A bit less than I'd hoped but I really just ran out of event ideas :/ Hopefully there's still enough flavour for at least a few runs :) Its a proof of concept if anything. \n\n![Screenie4.PNG](///raw/847/7/z/1cc84.png)\n\n**Resources, the name of the game**\n\nManaging resources effectively is key. The player will be required to keep tabs on supplies, food, fuel and morale to keep the party going. Running out of fuel? Trade some supplies with a nearby stronghold or camp. Morale running low? Get your guys an extra ration each to keep their spirits up. Haven't found food in a while? That's what the 'Cannibalise' button is for.\n\n![Screenie5.png](///raw/847/7/z/1ccb7.png)\n\n**Upgrade your Post-Apocalyptic Death Chariot**\n\nBy spending supplies gathered in the wastelands from random events like winning hostile encounters and scavenging, you can upgrade your bus to not only make it look cool as hell, with the final upgrade sporting an M1 Abrams cannon on the roof, but also increase your combat effectiveness. Combat effectiveness is calculated based on how many passengers you have that can fight, how well supplied you are, and the upgrade level of your Bus.\n\n![BusLevel1.png](///raw/847/7/z/1cc8a.png)\n![BusLevel2.png](///raw/847/7/z/1cc87.png)\n![BusLevel3.png](///raw/847/7/z/1cc86.png)\n![BusLevel4.png](///raw/847/7/z/1cc85.png)\n\n**Tools Used**\nArt: Photoshop\nEngine: Unity\nScripting: Visual Studio\nMusic/Ambience: FL Studio 12\nSound: Audacity **Almost all sound effects across all 4 of my Ludum Dare entries have been edited recordings of my mouth**\n\n**Special Thanks**\n\nBig thanks to Papa Porg (https://www.facebook.com/porggod/?ref=br_rs) for shouting out the game in his facebook group.\nI never asked him too, he offered it. Thanks fam.\n\n**Final Notes**\n\nBeen looking through some of the entries this Ludum and they just keep getting better. I know I say this every time but I'm genuinely so impressed at what some people can do in just a couple of days. Keep it up guys. I'll see you in a few months. \n\n**IMPORTANT**\nOkay, so it's come to my attention that there is a bug where sometimes the road just ends. This is because the the mile count increases based on a collision that occurs when the car translates into a trigger. The car translates on an Update() function and because of this it updates more frequently at higher fps counts. This means that faster computers have more frequent events and a faster bus that will sometimes travel straight through the trigger and into the eternal nothingness. \nThe only way I know to fix this is to limit the fps somehow or play on higher resolutions to decrease the fps. I've tried using a FixedUpdate() function but that breaks other stuff. Apologies. I should have noticed this in playtesting and generally just made the game better. It was a very silly way of going about it.\n\n**Hope you enjoy the game.**\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//847/7/z/1baf1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/transit-terror","author":{"name":"Rytannic","uid":30536,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//847/7/z/1cf87.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/rytannic"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//847/7/z/1cc7e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//847/7/z/1cc7e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//847/7/z/1cc84.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//847/7/z/1cc84.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//847/7/z/1ccb7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//847/7/z/1ccb7.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//847/7/z/1cc8a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//847/7/z/1cc8a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//847/7/z/1cc87.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//847/7/z/1cc87.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//847/7/z/1cc86.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//847/7/z/1cc86.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//847/7/z/1cc85.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//847/7/z/1cc85.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/10sr7EP1pNW6pTXNq91UE7oegGRCMG923/view?usp=sharing"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://rytannic.itch.io/transit-terror"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Shepards Island","category":"jam","description":"Breed sheep for the sake of genetical mutations, but be aware of overpopulation!\n\n\nControls:\n\nA  and D : Camera rotation\n\nMouse: UI to breed and kill sheep\n\n\n** WebGL:  Play in full screen for best experience!

It's probably my favorite sci-fi short story, but I admittedly haven't read very many. Although I have adapted the story, every line of text in this game was written by me, by hand, during the compo. There might be some exchanges in dialogue that are very close because they left a strong impression upon me, but I strove to make this an original adaptation. For those who have read the short story, you may notice that the character names have been changed.

The main goal of the game is to bring Satan the Darklord back to life by collecting innocent and pure souls from the living. Games are short, an average of 2-min-game. Graphics are flat and simple(pixel art from very very far). The scene takes place during the night, 3 days before the Samhein. \nThe player with the greatest amount of collected souls wins the games and becomes Satan's wife (no regards of the player's gender), and the other one is burned alive.\n\nWe've treated the theme \"Sacrifices must be made\" as a sacred and wicked thing, with an analogy to the Samhein ritual (Halloween nowadays). By sacrificing untouched souls, witches are sacrificing themselves to anger, pride and jealousy. \n\nWe had a lot of fun doing this game, and, as it is our first Ludum Dare (but not first gamejam tho), we are quite proud of the results, even if it is not perfect and some work has to be done. We are planning on working on it again later, to add some functionalities such as familiars which would help you collecting more souls, or changing light atmosphere or animations. \n\nWe are pretty satisfied of this final result, and we hope you will enjoy playing it ;) Also, if you have any piece of advice or any question, please, feel free to ask in the comment section ! :)\n\n\n\n\nNEEDS: 2 X-Box (one) remotes and 2 pure and innocent humans\n\n\n\n\nROLES:\nUnity Developper: Baptiste Guérin\n\nDA/Graphist: Sarah GERGAUD\nGraphist: Slevin Vloëbergh\n\nUX and Level Designer: Quentin Renoux \n\nYacine El Makhzoumi and Quentin Thomas, two amazing sound designers.\n\n\n\n\nAll Game Design Students at School of Design nantes Atlantiques.\n\n\n\n\n\nLots of love, \n\nSarah, Baptiste, Quentins, Slévin, Yacine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![Capture.PNG](///raw/bcf/d1/z/1be97.png)\n![Tuto.PNG](///raw/bcf/d1/z/1be9a.png)\n![47100603_495883577599218_6694545922044461056_n.png](///raw/bcf/d1/z/1bec2.png)\n![WitchHunt Gameplay.gif](///raw/bcf/d1/z/1be9b.gif)\n![Fin.PNG](///raw/bcf/d1/z/1be9d.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//bcf/d1/z/1be98.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/samhein-souls","author":{"name":"sgergaud","uid":122827,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/sgergaud"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//bcf/d1/z/1be97.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//bcf/d1/z/1be97.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//bcf/d1/z/1be9a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//bcf/d1/z/1be9a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//bcf/d1/z/1bec2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//bcf/d1/z/1bec2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//bcf/d1/z/1be9b.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//bcf/d1/z/1be9b.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//bcf/d1/z/1be9d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//bcf/d1/z/1be9d.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://danalix.itch.io/samhein-souls"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Land's Sacrifice","category":"compo","description":"In Land's Sacrifice, you must build a base that can withstand the attacks of others.

The ugly goal sprite is now replaced with something slightly less ugly, but the end game is still only a simple congratulations screen.\n\nWe hope you enjoy playing this updated version of the game :)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//933/f1/z/1bddb.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/pixel-rot","author":{"name":"MemoryLeek","uid":127801,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/memoryleek"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//933/f1/z/1be1a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//933/f1/z/1be1a.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://github.com/MemoryLeek/ld43/archive/ld43-2.zip"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/MemoryLeek/ld43/releases/download/ld43-2/PixelRot-win64-2.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://github.com/MemoryLeek/ld43/releases/download/ld43-2/PixelRot-linux64-2.tar.gz"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Sacrifice Yourself!","category":"compo","description":"The very famous Dr. I.D.G.A.F. has come up with another master plan, as he spent too much time thinking and forgot to come up with something in a multi dimensional event called a \"Ludum Dare\" (no I have no idea what that is either, but every April, October and November I am haunted by these dreams, please help me why do I feel the sudden urge to program.

States descended into chaos and their remains are ran by the corporations and private armies controller by warlords. The world has become a hunting ground where only one rule applies - survival of the fittest. But there is still hope, legendary City of the lights. Legend says, it's hard to reach the city and the journey requires many sacrifices. But legendary neon tank warriors are not scared of sacrifice and to reach the end of their journey they are able to sacrifice even components from their tanks.\n\n**You are one of the legendary neon tank warriors**\n\n**And this is your journey**\n\n## Controls: \n**WASD / Arrow Keys** Move tank around\n\n**Mouse** Aim\n\n**Left Mouse Button** Primary Weapon\n\n**Right Mouse Button** Secondary Weapon\n\n**CTRL / CMD + Q** Quit game any time\n\n## Team:\n[Martin Novák](http://www.twitter.com/wolaroj) - Coding, 2D Graphics, Bitching Around\n\n**Ondřej Dovec** - 3D Models, Enemy Design, Food Delivery\n\n**Lukáš Tůma** - Level Design, Drinking Coffee\n\n**Adam Lysák** - Coding\n\n**Wolar Games** (Our company) -  [Web](http://www.wolargames.com) | [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/wolargames) | [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/wolargames)\n\n## Tools:\nUnity, Photoshop, Blender, Audacity, DoTween (Unity Plugin) \n\n## Notes:\nThis time we worked for around 24 hours in total (12 hours per day, 2 days)\n\nThere is a known bug in the game that causes \"give up\" text to disappear on the button. If this happens, the red button means -> Double Click to Give Up. Another know bug is that under some circumstances some enemies might be able to push you out of level. We also had some performance problems with runtime nav mesh regeneration but that is hopefully fixed / improved.\n\nSource code is stripped of all the paid Unity plugins (editor extensions) and pro version of DoTween was replaced with free version.

Leave a comment and I'll make sure to try out your game too. Let me know how long you lasted, my best is 44 years.\n\nAim of the game: Try and survive for as long as possible against waves of mysterious invaders\n\nHow to play: Sacrifice animals and prisoners to generate 'Nature' and 'Revenge' power to build towers to repel the invaders. In desperate times you can also sacrifice your youngsters to gain 'Vitality' and Elders to gain 'Elder'. These two towers are more powerful but more expensive.\n\nNotes: \nFarms generate 2 animals per year\nPrisons allow room for 5 additional prisoners\nHouses allow 8 citizens to live\nYoungsters and Adults generate children if there is population space.\nAs the years pass these citizens age\nElders generate passive power (except 'Revenge')\nPrisoners have a chance to be captured when a tower hits an enemy\nPrisoners can be sacrificed for power or ransomed for gold\nTowers can't be built in the firing range of other towers (The extra range of vitality towers can restrict future tower placement)\n\nTowers:\nNature - Average Fire Rate, Average Health, Average Capture Chance\nVitality - Average Fire Rate, High Health, Low Capture Chance, High Range\nElder - Very Fast Fire Rate, Low Health, High Capture Chance\nRevenge - Fast Fire Rate, Average Health, Very High Capture Chance\n\nTips:\nAt the start of the game sacrifice all your animals and build a Nature Tower\nEither Sacrifice your prisoners to get a Revenge tower as soon as possible or ransom them to build farms for more animals\nBuild a house with your initial money as you start close to the pop cap\nThe spawn rate gets faster over time and starts to really ramp up after 25 years\n![Game.png](///raw/50c/8/z/1bdab.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//50c/8/z/1bd99.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/itza-panic","author":{"name":"Taffaz","uid":35845,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/taffaz"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//50c/8/z/1bdab.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//50c/8/z/1bdab.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://www.taffaz.com/ludum/ld43/web/"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.taffaz.com/ludum/ld43/win/LD43.zip"},{"label":"Source code","url":"http://www.taffaz.com/ludum/ld43/source/LD43.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Bomba Ball","category":"compo","description":"Bomba ball is a brand-spanking-new sport that combines physical excellence and high explosives.\n\nAs coach, assign your players roles to play and let them do the work.

You control a spaceship which consists of modules. \n## Modules\nAny flying module that hits the ship will be attached to it.\nOnly if module is reachable from **Main Module** it can be attach to the ship. A module can't be reached through a **Block Module**.\n\nThere are few types of modules:\n- **Main module**. If this module is destroyed you lose\n![main_module.png](///raw/9ca/31/z/1bd18.png)\n- **Empty module**\n![module.png](///raw/9ca/31/z/1bd19.png)\n- **Engine module**.

Allows you to swap 2 modules at the en of a level\n![swap_module.png](///raw/9ca/31/z/1bd1e.png)\n\n\n## Movements\nYou move by turns with burs fires from engines. You can only move in a direction if you have an engine facing opposite direction. E.g. if you only have 2 engines facing left, you can only move right 1 or 2 spaces.\n## Enemies\nYour enemies are orange asteroids that fly around. If they hit any of your modules, they will be destroyed along with module.\n## Engine blast\nYou can destroy enemies (or flying modules) with blasts from your engines. Those explosions will also destroy any module underneath an engine, so be careful.\n## Sacrifice\nYou can sacrifice any of your modules in order to overload your engines. This will last one turn and each engine will be able to move the ship 2 spaces instead of 1. Click on any module to sacrifice it.\n## Swapping\nFor each **Swap Module** at the end of a level, you can swap two modules. Simply click modules to swap them. You can swap a module with an empty space to just move it.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9ca/31/z/1bd30.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/spaceships-must-explode","author":{"name":"Maksim Chugunov","uid":80585,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/maksim-chugunov"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9ca/31/z/1ce66.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9ca/31/z/1ce66.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9ca/31/z/1bd18.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9ca/31/z/1bd18.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9ca/31/z/1bd19.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9ca/31/z/1bd19.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9ca/31/z/1bd1c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9ca/31/z/1bd1c.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9ca/31/z/1bd1d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9ca/31/z/1bd1d.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9ca/31/z/1bd4b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9ca/31/z/1bd4b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9ca/31/z/1bd1e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9ca/31/z/1bd1e.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://maks-c.itch.io/ships-must-explode"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/makscee/SpaceshipsMustExplode"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Sacrifice Party","category":"compo","description":"![screen2.png](///raw/01a/e1/z/1bd89.png)![screen3.png](///raw/01a/e1/z/1bd8a.png)\n**[TW : cartoon violence against animals]** This game has for theme occult ceremonies and does picture animal sacrifice.

You have to find your way through a dangerous maze where all walls are poisoned. To reach the exit you have to die - a lot! Luckily you can collect your dead bodies to get back your lost live and continue your search for the right way to the exit.\n\nAttention: You need a real C64 or an emulator like WinVICE to play this game. ~~I'll add more options to play later in the evening.~~\n\nUnfortunaly I'm not able to provide you with a HTML5 version, as I can't get VICE.js to work with gamepad or keyboard. Nonetheless you can download a proper C64 emulator for your system here: http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/. \n\n## Running on Windows ##\nDownload WinVICE from above site and unpack the files in a folder of your choise. Copy everything from the Commodore 64-zip (mazeofdeath.zip) into the WinVICE folder. Run *start.bat* to automatically run **Maze of Death** in the emulator. Use numpad to play the game. If you prefer a gamepad go to *Settings > Joystick settings > Joystick settings...* and select your gamepad from the select box of Joystick #2. In this dialog you can also create your personal control scheme.\n\n## Running on other systems ##\nUnfortunaly I can't provide any help to make **Maze of Death** work on OSX or Linux. But steps should be similar.\n\n## Compiling the source ##\nTo compile the source code you need **CBM prg Studio** (http://www.ajordison.co.uk/). Beware: The game is much slower, if compiled from sources. Maze generation takes over a minute, also moving the player is slower. \n\nYou'll need a BASIC compiler for C64 to make the game faster. For **Maze of Death** I used Austrospeed. Other compilers like Basic-Boss or BASIC 64 might also work, but need some compiler directives to run properly. Speed improvements are subtle with other compilers. \n\n![mod_ingame_2.gif](///raw/7e5/a1/z/1bb04.gif)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7e5/a1/z/1bb05.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/maze-of-death","author":{"name":"hamrathdoesldjam","uid":108007,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/hamrathdoesldjam"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7e5/a1/z/1bb04.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7e5/a1/z/1bb04.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"Commodore 64","url":"https://hamrath.itch.io/maze-of-death"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://hamrath.itch.io/maze-of-death"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"For The Will Of Gods","category":"compo","description":"![newGif3.gif](///raw/25c/a1/z/1b972.gif)\n\n**So**, you are the good and kind God who wants to help these little creatures called people to stay alive, but to do this difficult task you have to sacrifice them so the bad gods won't hurt them. \nSo, go and challenge the Bad Gods, what are you waiting for?:)\n\n**Development Tools:**\n\n- Unity 3D\n\n- Visual Studio\n \n- Photoshop\n\n- Wolfram Tones Music Generator\n\n**Little Tutorial:**\n- Drag people from house to the Totem to decrease Gods Rage (but you also decrease the people happiness then)\n- The more people there are - the faster Gods Rage will increase\n- If the Gods Rage is full - prepare for the Armageddon!\n- By destroying the doom stones you can stop the Armageddon and increase the people happiness\n\n**So, you have to watch the Bad Gods Rage and the people happiness to keep people alive as long as you can**\n**Note:**people will try to run away from the temple!\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//25c/a1/z/1bc72.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/for-the-will-of-gods","author":{"name":"Erendelous","uid":109650,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/erendelous"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//25c/a1/z/1b972.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//25c/a1/z/1b972.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://erendelous.itch.io/for-the-will-of-gods"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://erendelous.itch.io/for-the-will-of-gods"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wqCncJpAfo0kxcCaxnVwNmn5P6oRayAP"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Wizard Malikens spell failed","category":"jam","description":"You are on your way to the tower of a powerful wizard, your village needs protection from an orc army on the march.

Created some assets, thought about a bit of the story and a background informations. But never actualy build the game. Ludum Dare was the perfect chance to get it done. This game uses a lot of big assets. They are from the ue4 market place and self created. It is story and character driven and should have around 30 minutes play time. You have to combine items and solve riddles. And to be honest: I would have prefered the \"magic, but at what cost theme\", but this game has a few sacrifices in it, maybe even the most classical one. So have fun :)\n\nFilesize: 1300 MB\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//67c/d/z/1b336.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/wizard-malikens-spell-failed","author":{"name":"rohezal","uid":56438,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//67c/d/z/e227.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/rohezal"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//67c/d/z/1b339.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//67c/d/z/1b339.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//67c/d/z/1b337.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//67c/d/z/1b337.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//67c/d/z/1b338.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//67c/d/z/1b338.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://104.129.2.56/download/maliken_final_2.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"The Last Grinder","category":"jam","description":"Animals have to be sacrificed to feed mankind.

The first hit will leave the villager running for help. If it manages to collide with another villager, it will get \"upset\" and it will lower your popularity meter.  \n- If you're carrying a villager you must avoid touching other villagers, as they will became \"upset\" too and lower your popularity meter as well.\n- To increase your popularity meter you have to spend money at the shop.\n- The god of raining boulders is angry. Boulders will rain from the sky constantly. One hit drains half of your life bar, two hits and you're dead. Don't forget to buy potions at the shop.\n- A reptilian thief will run from left to right every once in a while. If you manage to kill him you'll earn 50 gold coins to spend at the shop. Be aware that reptilian thiefs are fast bastards, so they may run away from your range if you don't manage to land 5 hits on them prior to reaching your village's limits.\n\n\n**Potions**\n- Potions can be bought at the shop and they will be consumed automatically when the player gets hurt.\n\n\n## Notes\n\nI've used my previous entry as a \"game engine\" and that allowed me to have the Sunday off and also to spend a little bit more time with the music than in my previous jams (I have loops longer than 16 beats... ooooohhhh xD).  \nBorrowed gameplay ideas from my LD40 entry **\"Billy the giant hates dancing paragliders on a boat\"**.

You can hold down the button to suck up lots of units or drop lots of units. Once you're done, click the Relocate button again to finish. (This whole process only uses 1 action point, but use it wisely)\n\nYou can also use Shamans (purple figure) directly, click on one and it'll show a list of Shaman abilities, these work much the same as Site abilities, but they can also require a number of souls, a Shaman can gather souls by killing followers and the like, granting them more powers. If you have a Shaman gain many souls from killing, they can be later sacrificed to the Serpent God by sacrificing the Shaman at the Serpent Totem.\n\nHowever, sacrificing increases Rebellion in the town, for every Rebellion over 5, a new Rebel (red figure) is spawned in the town, and rebellion will go down slightly. But each turn that ends with a Rebel in the town, the rebellion will increase by 1 per Rebel.\nYou can deal with Rebels by building a Temple and Re-educating them, or building a Barracks and training Soldiers (green figures), if a Soldier ends their turn on the same site as a Rebel, they will kill each other. Temples and Watchtowers can also help reduce Rebellion before Rebels are spawned.\n\nOnce you're out of useful actions, End the Turn in the bottom right.\nHowever, the Serpent God requires at least one sacrifice per turn, if you fail to provide this, she will make your followers Sick (black figure) and you'll need to heal them.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//980/1/z/1ba2b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/serpents-souls","author":{"name":"impbox","uid":4233,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//980/1/z/3524.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/impbox"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//980/1/z/1ba2c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//980/1/z/1ba2c.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://impbox.itch.io/serpents-souls"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/ftsf/ld43-serpents-souls"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://www.impbox.net/ld43/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"43 and Me","category":"compo","description":"You start with 43 and you have to reach exactly 0. \nYou can't go lower than 0.\nYou can't go higher than 43.\n\nUse WASD or keyboard arrow keys to play.\n\nThis was my first participation in any game jam and it was pretty fun! \nAny feedback is appreciated.\n\n![RandomStart.png](///raw/344/11/z/1c22b.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//344/11/z/1cfe0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/43-and-me","author":{"name":"Atium Addict","uid":70723,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/atium-addict"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//344/11/z/1c22b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//344/11/z/1c22b.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://atium-addict.itch.io/43-and-me"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/AtiumAddict/43andMe"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"It had to be done. - Ludum Dare 43","category":"jam","description":"In this game, you are a Sooouuubway employee who is lost and running in the desert (don't ask)\nI managed to work around the theme with a smart trick!\nAlso, this is my first jam and I'm only 12 so please don't be too mean :)\n\n-Cactus :)\n\n![Barrel.png](///raw/57d/f1/z/1b9ee.png)\n![Run_Anim_1.png](///raw/57d/f1/z/1b9ea.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//57d/f1/z/1ba12.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/it-had-to-be-done-ludum-dare-43","author":{"name":"Cactus8","uid":130421,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/cactus8"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//57d/f1/z/1b9ee.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//57d/f1/z/1b9ee.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//57d/f1/z/1b9ea.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//57d/f1/z/1b9ea.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3hsvxdz6rrfl24e/AAA4nGogHVLW4Sz9pTl2wnQaa?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Chrum Chrum Satan","category":"jam","description":"Play with Your friend as satanist pigs, who have decided to sacrifice their keen to The Lord And Destroyer.

It was hard finding an aesthetic that worked well with the gameplay and concept, so I just went simple. Unfortunately due to the nature of the controls, (which should be explained in game but there is an attached cheatsheat), it is gamepad only.

It is about the sacrifice that parents make for the sake of their children. The game lasts exactly 5 minutes - You have to live your life and make your choices within that time. You are a butterfly who has the choice to explore the world, woo a mate and make babies.\n\nThis game is my perspective as an almost 30 year old single male looking at my father’s sacrifices and what is expected of me in the future. The viewpoint of the game from my perspective is an inherently cynical one. I’m not fond of the loss of freedom that comes from having kids. This may be offensive to some but that is my personal viewpoint at this point in my life. \n\nThe game is gender neutral. There is no explicit gender coding of the main playable character and the NPCs.\n\nInspiration: I’m a huge fan of the mechanics as metaphor movement. This game is my love letter to Jason Rohrer’s seminal work - Passage. Other inspirations are: Loneliness, One Hour One Life and Everything.\n\nHere is a list of intentional mechanics in the game and their corresponding meanings:\n1. Strict time limit - inspired by “Passage” -the time we have on this earth is finite\n2. Being bound in the nest for the first 18 years - sheltered life\nChoice in mating - You can choose to explore the world instead of settling\n3. Earning points is slower once you leave the nest because it gets a lot harder to work in the real world.\n4. Providing for the family deducts score from self.\n\nHere are a list of mechanics I couldn’t implement because of a lack of time :\n1. If you choose to explore the world, you’ll find different flowers and the music will change based on how far you travel away from the center.\n2. There will be a visual feedback on the butterfly’s wings signifying the energy of the butterfly - higher the self/family ratio - more brighter the colors\n3. There should be something to say about the joy of raising a family too. I don’t understand yet how I’ll express that.\n4. As the character grows older, moving about should be harder and there should be a visual feedback in the world. \n5. Sometimes you can have siblings that you have to compete with.\n6. You can be born with a single parent or no parents at all.\n7. You can choose to leave behind your family after marrying - signifying a betrayal.\n8. You can choose to have multiple children or even remarry.\n9. Probabilities of above features could be pulled from real world divorce, single parenthood and children birth rates.\n10. Need to add music\n11. Could be a io type game\n\nI’m always learning new things of this amazing art form.

The core goal of the game is to defeat the evil behemoth king. This is done by absorbing enemies, collecting and using their life energy to increase in size until you are large enough to fight the king directly. Once you increase in size smaller enemies won't supply further life essence; you can effortlessly overpower and absorb them to heal yourself but you will need to fight behemoths of your own size to continue growing. Naturally you aren't immune to the laws of nature either; you stand no chance against behemoths larger than you, who are more than happy to absorb you for sustinance.\n\nBattles are turn-based in traditional RPG style, with an on-attack quick-time event allowing the 0layer to dull an enemy blow or bolster their own attacks and spells. Enemies are absorbed as they fall mod-battle, meaning against tougher groups of enemies the player can harvest life essence and treasures off an enemy before swiftly retreating from the fight. On the other hand, defeating all enemies will reward the player additional life essence, with the amount increasing based on the number of enemies faced.\n\nThe game is aimed to be story-focused and driven, with game mechanics supplimenting the narrative. Without spoilers, the gams starts with a necessary sacrifice that plays a persisting role in how this story plays out.","thumbnail_url":"","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/in-a-land-of-behemoths","author":{"name":"OdinTheUnknown","uid":131226,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/odintheunknown"},"screens":[],"links":[],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Quantic Paouf IV","category":"jam","description":"\n\n**Save particles with your gravity (you can't save them all).**\n\n**Bring them to the exit (as much as possible).**\n\n**Beware, Black Holes and Shadow zone.**\n\n\n\n\nThe game contains a single level, but i hope i will have time for more later\n\n  => I have just cheated and add a very simple first level\n\n  => please do not sacrifice me for that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Considere playing Post Ludum Version**\n  \n\n\n\n\nDone in the conditions of Compo except for assets that I have googled.\n\nI apologize, but you won’t probably be able to compile the solution due to library dependancies.\nQuanticPaouf has been mad with my own 'chaos' engine\n\nThe source is split in three parts:\n\n- Ludum43: the game itself\n- chaos: a base libray, the core of the engine\n- death: another library more dedicated for games\n\n\n![POST_Capture8.PNG](///raw/7d2/1/z/1f3eb.png)\n\n\n\n![POST_Capture9.PNG](///raw/7d2/1/z/1f3ec.png)\n\n\n![Capture4.PNG](///raw/7d2/1/z/1c86a.png)\n\n## GAMEPAD CONTROLS:\n\n    Gamepad to displace\n    Right Trigger for a faster displacement\n    Button A : eject the particles\n\n    Start / Select : pause the game\n\n## KEYBOARD CONTROLS:\n\n    Arrows to move\n    SpaceBar for a faster displacement\n    Right Control : eject the particles\n\n\n    P : Pause\n    ESC : Restart\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7d2/1/z/1c887.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/quantic-paouf-iv","author":{"name":"shubart","uid":4823,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/shubart"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7d2/1/z/1f3eb.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7d2/1/z/1f3eb.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7d2/1/z/1f3ec.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7d2/1/z/1f3ec.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7d2/1/z/1c86a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7d2/1/z/1c86a.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/hubartstephane/Ludum43/tree/master/codes"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/hubartstephane/Ludum43/raw/master/binary/windows/QuanticPaouf4.zip"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/hubartstephane/Ludum43/tree/master/postludum_binary/windows"},{"label":"web","url":"https://youtu.be/caTUUP3MxfQ"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":43,"title":"Jumpman Skill Builder","category":"jam","description":"\n*** Build your skills as a Jumpman ***\n\nThe game is multiplayer \"obby\" (what the kids call an obstacle course).
