Tested with firefox and chrome with HD5850, GTX670, GTX560 and Quadro4000.\n\nThe submission (goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/~pknowles/blob-submit/) had some bugs, which didn't appear on my 660, so I've put together a \"post-compo version\" which should give an idea of what the game was meant to be.\n\n== The Game ==\nYou are red. Only red blobs can be moved by you.\nThe aim: to eat food (green), reproduce and attack blue, becoming the dominant blobs!\nLarger red/blue blobs will destroy smaller red/blue blobs.\nEating a green blob will duplicate the eater, with size deviation - evolution :)\nYou must balance eating and attacking (to cull your smaller blobs), encouraging evolution of larger red blobs.\nThe game ends when you lose too many blobs or destroy a significant portion of blue blobs.\n\nSorry to those of you without the hardware to run this. I built the game around my interest in GL shaders. The game itself runs almost entirely on the GPU and can happily handle blobs on the order of one million.\n\n== Controls ==\nLeft drag to move red blobs. You \"draw\" force.\nScroll to zoom (not entirely necessary).\nRight drag to pan.\n\n== Tech Details ==\nEach level is randomized at launch with perlin noise. I compute a signed distance field for collision detection with the level. Blobs move with a fragment shader, writing to a double buffered a floating point texture. Interaction is achieved by additively drawing density, velocity etc on to a texture which other blobs can read (These can be viewed by pressing tilde \"~\"). I count the number of remaining blobs similarly to mipmapping before reading a very small texture back to the CPU. The blobs are rendered by raycasting a density texture, similarly to parallax mapping, applying transmittance and environment mapping.\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/87b9aff159c1bc689a38446fa342e581.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=16649","author":{"name":"pknowles","uid":16649,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/008ad8537ad207778f23587407e943bd?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/pknowles/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16649-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16649-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16649-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16649-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16649-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16649-shot2.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/~pknowles/blob/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":56},{"area":"graphics","rank":227,"score":3.3},{"area":"innovation","rank":247,"score":3.15},{"area":"fun","rank":596,"score":2.26},{"area":"mood","rank":604,"score":2.14},{"area":"theme","rank":652,"score":2.05},{"area":"overall","rank":663,"score":2.35}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Defense Of The Space Station Guardian","category":"compo","description":"All work completed by me, of course.

Every time your units reach 10 XP, they can choose to level up and get stronger, or evolve into a new unit.  \n\nThere is no AI, unfortunately.  The enemy units just sort of stand lifeless as you assault them.  I never wrote an AI before so I focused on what I knew during the 48 hour compo, and ran out of time before I could even attempt any AI instructions.  But you can still attack them (or yourself - a true tactics game never disallows you from killing yourself!) to gain XP.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't complete data for many of the planned units within the 48 hours, but the game IS \"moddable\" - you can edit data/Units.xml to add units that will automatically be linked and loaded with the appropriate resources.  Not too hard to figure out if you're actually that motivated.\n\nThe game is in a very basic state.  This is my first LD and I DEFINITELY overplanned for how long the code took to get going.  Not to mention I had never worked in this library before!  Lots of fun though, and definitely a good learning experience for next

Â Anyway, here's download links and a web player: Beware of bugs, I've already found one myself! Mouse and WASD controls, left click once to fire, left click again to let go. When attached to something the ball that comes out of your gun  will pull you towards it. You're gonna have to adapt to some quite interesting situations to get a good score!

Exterminate! is an arena based schmup style game, where the enemies evolve/mutate with each other, sharing their genetic traits (including colour). \n\nThere are three types of enemies, Red, Green and Blue. Enemies with strong colour channels (visible in their appearance) will receive attacking abilities matching that colour. These attacks stack, so yellow enemies (strong in red and green) will have both the red and green attacks. Enemies that are strong in all 3 colour channels are known as \"PureBred\" (White in appearance) and will have all 3 of the attacks, making them the most dangerous. Essentially, Bright enemies are genetically superior, Dull enemies are genetically inferior.\n\nYou can receive a power up called \"The Devolver\" (bad revolver pun intended). This gun comes in the three colours, and will be automatically applied to your attacks for a short amount of time. Attacks with The Devolver will remove genetic traits from enemies, for example, a Red Devolver will remove the red colouration from enemies, and thus weakening them.\n\nGoal:\nThe goal of the game is to survive as long as possible, to get the best score!\n\nControls:\nW,A,S,D to move.\nLeft Click to shoot.\nRight click to use a bomb.\n\n\nNote for download: The zip file is password protected as it contains an executable for the installer (sorry). The password is: ludumdare24\nAlso, sorry for the file size, the game is only about 4mb, but I had to include the DirectX redistributable with the installer.\n\nFor those wondering, Immortal Games is the indie studio I am co-founder of. I wrote the engine being used, which is written in C++ with lua scripting support and a DirectX11 renderer. This game was made on my own for a bit of fun. I wanted to go in the compo, not the Jam, but unfortunately the engine is our companies proprietary property.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ca328f6de3921bc67fe28bfb68b29533.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=15995","author":{"name":"warheart","uid":15995,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9f5dab4ea61e73e40ab3f68dc2b1b033?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/warheart/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15995-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15995-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15995-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15995-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15995-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15995-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15995-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15995-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15995-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15995-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.immortalgames.com.au/MutateExterminateInstaller.zip"},{"label":"Youtube","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JA9nm26kWQ "}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1171,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Obsolete Upgrade","category":"jam","description":"You play as an old out-dated computer.

Have a look at that for a getting started guide, tips & tricks and details about the mechanics: what the genes do, the critters biology, how they interact with the environment and rival species.\n\nHave fun!! ~berkano","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/eae8279d2982d78e267f64e2ecf7bf33.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=11027","author":{"name":"berkano","uid":11027,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/77c7ac75ea82efc0ce00501df57722ba?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/berkano/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11027-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11027-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21611/ld24/final/CritterLab.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21611/ld24/final/CritterLab.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21611/ld24/final/CritterLab.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21611/ld24/final/CritterLab.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21611/ld24/final/CritterLab-Source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":59},{"area":"theme","rank":12,"score":4.29},{"area":"innovation","rank":115,"score":3.52},{"area":"audio","rank":199,"score":2.9},{"area":"overall","rank":349,"score":3.03},{"area":"mood","rank":399,"score":2.58},{"area":"humor","rank":414,"score":1.95},{"area":"fun","rank":476,"score":2.6},{"area":"graphics","rank":570,"score":2.37}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Darwin Dash","category":"compo","description":"Darwin Dash is a procedurally generated sidescrolling shooter.\n\nPlay as the eponymous biologist as he researches the wildlife of a remote island and indeterminately blows things up!\n\nA & D to walk, space to jump, click to shoot.\nDon't let the water get above your head!\n\nTo install, simply extract the folder from the included zip file.\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/9ac31574382356a6a0371169f2edacac.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14921","author":{"name":"Phase","uid":14921,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1af325105a5a9f97e0a33983328afd2c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/phase/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14921-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14921-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14921-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14921-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?pu2aqa896uufjzn"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?1l0djaqh99vgulv"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1171,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Evolution","category":"compo","description":"A brief history of evolution...\n\nThis is my second participation. \ncode : java with PlayN\ngraphic : paint\nmusic : http://tones.wolfram.com/generate/","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/eeb9640e3fa731081755afa58bb1b0b0.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=8354","author":{"name":"drschizzo","uid":8354,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/10df557a5a64d95f134922ceccaa18d3?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/drschizzo/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8354-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8354-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53706371/evolution.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53706371/evolution/src.rar"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1112,"score":10}],"platforms":["web","java","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Evolution Is A Boring Theme","category":"jam","description":"(May take a second to load)\n\nBored with the idea of Evolution as a theme, we've made a quiz based completely on Pokemon evolutions.\n\nThat may sound ridiculous, and it is, I can't believe we actually went through with what was essentially an off-hand joke, but this isn't your ordinary quiz game.

The source is a GM81 file which holds the completed game and can be used on any current version of Game Maker for Windows.

Yoni (the programmer) here. Over the weekend (September 1) I released a bugfix version. The gameplay is the same, but lots of annoying physics bugs were fixed. You should play that one! If you want to rate based on what we had by the deadline, that version's available too. :)\n\nThe website is much improved too, check it out: http://www.yonispants.com/DGP\n\n-------\n\nSpace, the year 2014. DGP Space Lion arrived at planet Shetty following a report on a stolen vehicle. Minutes after arriving, he realized his spacepolice car was missing, most likely stolen by one of the local low-lifes. Stranded on a foreign world, he must now search the entire planet for his ride and get back home, to file a report. It's a dangerous world out there, filled with Gnorlms and Knarxals, known to be highly adaptable to any kind of weapon used against them. May the gods have mercy on their souls.\n\nThe enemies evolve quickly, and before long they will resist all your attacks! Try alternating weapons to beat your opponents.\n\nThis game and its absolutely accurate physics were inspired by Bollywood cinema.\n\nControls:\nArrow keys - move\nA - punch\nS - kick\nD - use weapon\nQ - next weapon\nE - previous weapon\nF - toggle fullscreen\n\nIf you find the game too hard, enter the cheat code LION to get 99 lives, full health, all weapons and type a digit between 1 and 8 to skip to that level.\n\nNEW!

The game is a turn-based strategy and the goal is simply to capture all of the nodes on the board. You can transform your characters into one of two new forms by capturing a node. Many of the theme-related elements that were included in the original concept (e.g. different life forms evolving mid-battle and the environment itself changing) are missing due to a lack of time and the game suffers I think from not having been play tested enough as I spent most of my time just trying to get features up and running. The lack of audio is a disappointment but the deadline caught up with me. Instructions are include within the game and repeated below it on the HTML page if you need to refer to them.\n\nThanks for playing and congrats. to everyone who has finished and submitted an entry.\n\n[EDIT] Armoured Life-forms cannot capture nodes (this is noted in the instructions but I'm repeating it here because a few people have had issues) and once you have transformed a life-form into an armoured unit then you can't turn it back. This is a known issue that I was unable to correct in the time limit, to play successfully you'll need to keep at least one life form in a normal or speed form. If I find the time to do a post-compo version then I'll add a 'revert' button to turn a unit back to a normal state or put a cap on the number of armour units.

I wanted it to be about adapting to a hostile, harsh environment, but I didn't know how to make it more interactive. So, eventually I just added enemies and a lot of shooting. It is playable, just not very fun. Also, I wanted to do music and sound FX for it, but I ran out of time. :-/\n\nHere is a more in-depth description of the game, from its readme:\nYou control a group of mono-gendered organisms who must escape their hostile environment. You start off with 4 organisms. Each level you take control over them one by one. Your goal is to lead them to safety, symbolized by a waving flag. After each level you get the choice to breed your organisms. Once you've bred two organisms they will be replaced by two new ones, their children, whose genetic code will be a random blend of their parents' genes.\nPassing on genes works like in real genetics. Every organism has two sets of their genes, one inherited from each parent.Genes have dominant and recessive variants, called alleles. Dominant alleles are written with a capital, recessive alleles with a lower-case letter. Dominant and recessive alleles provide different traits for the organism, for example a gene's dominant allele can cause the organism to grow smaller, while its recessive variant can cause the exact opposite - to grow bigger. If an organism has both the dominant and the recessive allele, the dominant will override the recessive one's effect.\nThe game includes two environments, selected at random: a cold one, covered in snow, and a hot one, covered in sand. Different genes provide protection against the heat and the cold, while other traits can cause the organism to be more vulnerable to the environmental effects. The hazards increase each level.\nSurviving 5 levels wins the game.  If all 4 organisms die, the game is lost.\n\nControls in the game:\nCursors/WASD - Move\nSpace/Y/Z - Shoot\n\nThe game requires the .NET Framework 4 and the XNA Framework Redistributable 4.\nYou can download these from:\n\n.NET Framework 4:\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851\n\nXNA Framework Redistributable 4:\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/144074ad416633c49e15be90353e8bdf.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=8403","author":{"name":"h.attila","uid":8403,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4236769cdd8ee86b4f715a09f6a615d5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/h-attila/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8403-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8403-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8403-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8403-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8403-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8403-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8403-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8403-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8403-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8403-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://attilahorvath.me/SelectiveBreeding.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://attilahorvath.me/SelectiveBreeding-source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1171,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Tribal Warfare","category":"compo","description":"In Tribal Warfare, you lead your tribe to victory over the gremlins.

Nathan was too tired to try.\nI was also too tired to finish all the graphics.\n\nBut all in all, it's quasi-polished and we're happy we did it, and it's more than a proof of concept. You can still play it with a friend, if you don't peek over his cards, but it's not very practical.\n\nOk, this is a game where a Demon Lord and an Angel battle it out with cards. The Demon Lord tries to kill the hero in a tower defense fashion. The Angel tries to keep him alive long enough to reach the end of the level.\n\nThe Demon Lord's traps evolve when a trap card is reinforced with a secondary (and tertiary) effect. \n\nEvolution also comes into play in the way the angel's protections and level upgrades to the hero remain with the hero. It's the standard evolution of RPGs.\n\nFinally, the very dungeon evolves during the course of the battle. Each time you play through the dungeon, the hero gets to experience a completely different adventure.\n\n\n\nHOW TO PLAY. \n\nWe tried to keep it super-simple.\nThe Demon Lord (\"Keeper\" of the dungeon) plays one of the trap cards (pit, crusher, rotating blades, spike, arrow trap) into one of the evil slots (the square with the double evil snake). The card summons a trap on the dungeon tile above it. The Keeper can play as many cards as his or her Mana will allow (your mana pool is the number on the top left corner of the game, next to the blue mana gem. The mana cost is at the bottom left of each card)\n\nOnce you have at least one trap in place, you can play an Upgrade(Evolution) card on it. This adds effects like mana steal or ice damage to your trap.\n\nYou then end your turn.\n\nThe Angel plays his/her own cards, which counter the Keeper's traps or make the hero more capable, in order to survive (extra strength etc).\n\nAfter the Angel ends turn, the battle phase of the game is like this:\n\nThe hero explores the dungeon one tile at a time, encountering traps or magic potions. Each time he lands on something evil, he takes damage, each time he lands on something good he is healed or given a positive effect.\n\nAfter all three tiles have been played out, the keeper starts again, and so on, until either the hero reaches the end of the dungeon (counted in steps, on the top right) in which case the Angel wins. Or the hero dies and the Keeper wins.\n\nNot implemented:\n- incidental music. I wrote it, but we didn't have time to implement the changes. So enjoy the static music track, it still took me half a day to finish.\n\n- a different take on the gameplay, in which the hero walks only one square at a time, and the players only get to play one card. We wanted to check both versions to see which is more fun, but ran out of time.\n\n- all the different card art. Turns out it's a huge job. I'm sorry :(\n\n- the AI, obviously\n\n\nSo, this is our attempt. Enjoy, do PLEASE leave feedback on the gameplay, and check back for updated versions.\n\n\nLD is the best!\n\nLove,\nChristina + Nathan\n\n\nTools used: Adobe Flash, Adobe Photoshop, Fruity Loops","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d6db35b405065b534d5bda39da788c34.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=13139","author":{"name":"Christina Antoinette Neofotistou","uid":13139,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0a555cf372fa7fe1970f3aa0215c4edb?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/christinaneofotistou/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13139-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13139-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13139-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13139-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (flash)","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/25675461/CardGame.html"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJokdfX1Bz8&feature=youtu.be"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":7,"score":4.58},{"area":"mood","rank":23,"score":3.66},{"area":"audio","rank":28,"score":3.7},{"area":"overall","rank":49,"score":3.51},{"area":"innovation","rank":63,"score":3.28},{"area":"fun","rank":107,"score":3},{"area":"humor","rank":158,"score":2},{"area":"theme","rank":218,"score":2.08},{"area":"coolness","rank":582,"score":48}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Besugo","category":"compo","description":"In this game you are a seabream and you must kill smaller fishes to survive in the hard sea depths. \n\nUnfortunately, Linux version doesn't have sound yet.

Also, since you might ask, the music gets better as you progress.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/509de098f2d44dd82bc071108c252525.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=4767","author":{"name":"kirbytails7","uid":4767,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/660ce2b7d318e48c789d4141583df6a3?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/kirbytails7/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4767-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4767-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4767-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4767-shot1.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4767-shot2.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4767-shot2.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4767-shot3.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4767-shot3.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.sketchhousegames.com/ExploreEvolveEscape/playgame.html"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JzyYkzsZ80"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.sketchhousegames.com/ExploreEvolveEscape/ExploreEvolveEscape.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":84},{"area":"theme","rank":83,"score":3.71},{"area":"fun","rank":211,"score":3.12},{"area":"overall","rank":240,"score":3.21},{"area":"innovation","rank":278,"score":3.07},{"area":"humor","rank":326,"score":2.19},{"area":"audio","rank":418,"score":2.26},{"area":"mood","rank":430,"score":2.52},{"area":"graphics","rank":439,"score":2.71}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"FOR THE darWIN","category":"jam","description":"Charles Darwin must dig the soils of a Galapagos island looking for fossil evidence to prove his theory of evolution.

That's it!\n\nPlease let me know what you think/how it could be improved and especially if there are any bugs you find. Also, please feel free to share your art and achievements in the comments section! \n\nResizing: Static can be resized; the tv frame will disappear, but everything still works!\n\nNOW ON THE INTERWEB!!!

With inspiration from the Hunger Games, politics, and the NES classic \"Shatterhand\", I was aiming to create a deadly arena that is constantly evolving.\n\nEvery 30-60 seconds, an alarm sounds, and you must return to the safe room. Once there, the outside will explode, and the arena will morph into a new, more powerful form. If you don't make it back in time, you die (or would had I finished). \n\nI unfortunately didn't get to implementing attacks or health, as the core mechanics took a long time to create, and I'm no artist, so that was taxing. All in all, I feel the project came out AMAZING for what I usually do in 48 hours, and I can't wait to carry on with this project and launch it for Halloween.\n\nAs far the the theme goes, the idea was a play on \"Natural Selection\". Additionally, the goal would be to evolve your skills faster than the growing arena, by collecting credit orbs which could be spent on upgrades. I didn't get that far, so for now, the evolution simply lies in the arena, and the play on Natural Selection.\n\nPlatform - Flash / AS3\n\nLibraries / Frameworks - FlashPunk, My Personal Platformer BolierPlate Code (included).\n\nGraphics - Can't believe I did that good. Photoshop, and practicing my pixel art. 1000x better than my norm.\n\nMusic - Composed during the competition using My Korg X-50 and Sonar 6 LE","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/7bdd57bf015b03c8802d936913b5f1d8.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=5692","author":{"name":"Porter","uid":5692,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4bb937152f7ed0757bc69d8b520c9f5d?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/porter/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5692-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5692-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5692-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5692-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5692-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5692-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5692-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5692-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5692-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5692-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.newgrounds.com/dump/item/70dd49b50b88d3afd9f64d20027dd681"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://gemfruit.com/uploads/jams/ludum_dare/24/"},{"label":"Music Download","url":"http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/500694"},{"label":"Post Mortem","url":"http://www.gemfruit.com/blog/ludum-dare-24-recap/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"audio","rank":45,"score":3.62},{"area":"graphics","rank":129,"score":3.63},{"area":"mood","rank":235,"score":2.92},{"area":"innovation","rank":336,"score":2.93},{"area":"theme","rank":552,"score":2.43},{"area":"overall","rank":569,"score":2.61},{"area":"humor","rank":591,"score":1.41},{"area":"fun","rank":632,"score":2.17},{"area":"coolness","rank":691,"score":42}],"platforms":["web","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Ancestry Haters","category":"compo","description":"Main features:\n- (only) 4 levels\n- generated background music\n- sounds created with sfxr\n- vector-style graphics\n- C++ source code (almost everything in one cpp file, sry)\n\nPS: Its my first ludum dare, and I love it :).\n\nPS2: I forgot to add sorces, sry","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/4b51bb977c3c4a4e7dda9722b88d7100.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=16468","author":{"name":"raver","uid":16468,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0af47e1b78760dc0f73817e46055b369?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/raver/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16468-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16468-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16468-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16468-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16468-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16468-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16468-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16468-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/23788845/Prototypes/Ludum%20Dare/LD24_AncestryHaters.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/23788845/Prototypes/Ludum%20Dare/LD24_AncestryHaters_Source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":95,"score":3.57},{"area":"fun","rank":169,"score":3.21},{"area":"overall","rank":280,"score":3.14},{"area":"graphics","rank":284,"score":3.14},{"area":"audio","rank":316,"score":2.57},{"area":"mood","rank":384,"score":2.62},{"area":"theme","rank":444,"score":2.71},{"area":"coolness","rank":932,"score":26}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"ANT FIGHT CLUB","category":"compo","description":"Part of the game is figuring out what chemicals to bath your ant species in to get better, but what they do is unknown at the start.

You attack by walking into them, they can attack you when they walk into you. Your health is the number in the top right, the max amount of damage you can do in one hit is the number below it and your speed is the number below that (all 3 are in green). Click on any slime and the same set of stats will appear in the same order for that slime (in red).\nThe two blue numbers are to do with when you can upgrade. The top one is your total kills, the bottom one is your target. Whenever your total is above your target, click on one of your stats to upgrade it. Upgrading health will increase your max health by 5 and give you max health. Use your upgrades wisely, they become harder to get as the game goes on.\n\nFinally the two black numbers at the bottom are the current level (top), and the best level you've reached in this session.\n\nSorry about the rubbish UI, I'm never very good at that stuff.\n\nA final warning, child slimes are often much more dangerous than their parents...\n\n(In retrospect, this needed a lot more balancing, but I still think it's fun!

Its appealing in one sense -- I like the theme and mechanics of this game, but I'm appalled at how messy the code gets so quickly.  I think if I was ever going to \"build upon\" a LD entry it would be a rewrite.\n\nThanks to my brother for testing and letting me use his windows laptop basically on demand.  And getting me stumptown coffee.\n\nEnjoy HumanTECH!!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/66859efd06ff484b60d35284bfff22a4.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=7032","author":{"name":"minism","uid":7032,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c5979674661a2dfa283802124a19580b?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/minism/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7032-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7032-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7032-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7032-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7032-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7032-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows (32 bit)","url":"http://minornine.com/games/files/humantech/humantech-win32.zip"},{"label":"Windows (64 bit)","url":"http://minornine.com/games/files/humantech/humantech-win64.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://minornine.com/games/files/humantech/humantech-osx.zip"},{"label":"LOVE","url":"http://minornine.com/games/files/humantech/humantech.love"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://minornine.com/games/files/humantech/humantech-src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"overall","rank":7,"score":4.13},{"area":"mood","rank":20,"score":3.85},{"area":"fun","rank":30,"score":3.78},{"area":"theme","rank":34,"score":3.96},{"area":"audio","rank":43,"score":3.64},{"area":"graphics","rank":59,"score":4.04},{"area":"innovation","rank":164,"score":3.35},{"area":"coolness","rank":641,"score":45}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Infestation","category":"compo","description":"Infestation is a fairly simple overhead shooter with enemies that evolve based on your actions.  The longer they stay alive, the more likely subsequent enemies are to share their traits.  Stay alive as long as you can and try to get the highest score!\n\nThere are 3 different weapons to use (Minigun, Laser, and Rockets) depending on the situation you find yourself in.  There are also 4 enemy traits: Health (green), Speed (purple), Intelligence (red), and Swarming.  The last one splits an enemy into multiple enemies each with a fraction of the total health.\n\nIts kind of difficult to tell, but new waves of enemies are generated based on the enemies that are currently alive.  So if lots of fast enemies are still alive, the next wave will contain even faster enemies.\n\nI had a lot of fun at my first Ludum Dare.  It was pretty hectic, but I think I made a pretty fun game with more polish than I was expecting for such a short development time.  Hope you enjoy playing!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/574353c3b359af28a146ce17ea910cc6.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14991","author":{"name":"jwin","uid":14991,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c80bbf68e586dd9a3155198c334be3aa?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/jwin/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14991-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14991-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14991-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14991-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14991-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14991-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14991-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14991-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14991-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14991-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://john-sample.elasticbeanstalk.com/projects/unity3d/infestation/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://john-sample.elasticbeanstalk.com/projects/unity3d/infestation/Infestation-Source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"fun","rank":77,"score":3.51},{"area":"graphics","rank":124,"score":3.64},{"area":"overall","rank":217,"score":3.26},{"area":"audio","rank":262,"score":2.71},{"area":"mood","rank":339,"score":2.69},{"area":"humor","rank":439,"score":1.89},{"area":"theme","rank":523,"score":2.5},{"area":"innovation","rank":627,"score":2.22}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"life, undeath","category":"compo","description":"zombies.\n\nsurvive.\n\nthe city in quarantine. you are the only survivor.\nyour rescue team arrives in three days.\ndifferent zombie traits give them strengths against your weapons.\nbe mindful of which zombies you kill... each night, those that survive create zombies with similar powers.\n\ncontrols:\nWAD : move, jump\nS : hold to interact\nspace: fire\n1, 2: select weapon\nX : next message","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/65990401486a9b6f9f74bc635187120d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=2460","author":{"name":"Zillix","uid":2460,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6f539fd466340cc681a83ce377d6a7a1?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/zillix/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2460-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2460-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2460-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2460-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2460-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2460-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2460-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2460-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5333420/lifeundeath.swf"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5333420/lifeundeath.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"fun","rank":97,"score":3.44},{"area":"graphics","rank":135,"score":3.61},{"area":"overall","rank":158,"score":3.39},{"area":"mood","rank":307,"score":2.75},{"area":"innovation","rank":350,"score":2.89},{"area":"theme","rank":352,"score":2.94},{"area":"humor","rank":361,"score":2.08},{"area":"coolness","rank":1040,"score":17}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Magistrate","category":"jam","description":"A town building simulation.

I wouldn't call it \"normal\", but if you just wait, game should start and run fine.\n\nEdit bisbis : I made a post compo made of tweaks to make it more playable, get it here : http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/08/29/post-compos-tweaks/ (these tweaks has been made OUTSIDE of the 48h, the real compo is on this page.)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/aade24992960e140c5779a3bf66cf9ee.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14514","author":{"name":"plule","uid":14514,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7dfd79c666beebd4085581b9be3942a7?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/plule/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14514-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14514-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14514-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14514-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13600725/ld24-run-transform/run_and_transform-1.1.win.zip"},{"label":"Linux-32b","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13600725/ld24-run-transform/run_and_transform-1.1-i686.lin.zip"},{"label":"Linux-64b","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13600725/ld24-run-transform/run_and_transform-1.1-x86_64.lin.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13600725/ld24-run-transform/run_and_transform.love"},{"label":"Mac OS (untested!)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13600725/ld24-run-transform/run_and_transform-1.1.osx.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":71},{"area":"mood","rank":203,"score":2.97},{"area":"audio","rank":288,"score":2.64},{"area":"overall","rank":324,"score":3.06},{"area":"humor","rank":337,"score":2.14},{"area":"fun","rank":348,"score":2.83},{"area":"graphics","rank":367,"score":2.94},{"area":"innovation","rank":435,"score":2.69},{"area":"theme","rank":440,"score":2.72}],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux","mac"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Snake Evolves","category":"compo","description":"This is the game for the \"Evolution\" themed competition.

In other words, the game is a creature, and you are its environment.\n\nI suppose the goal is to try and find all the evolutionary paths, some harder to find or beat then others, and win at them. So do that. (Hopefully, you can beat all of them this time. Don't worry, I've tested it more than Empty. Meaning I've tested it.)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/5aa931999b13e460c38f1ddf7fd02d32.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=11003","author":{"name":"Puzzlem00n","uid":11003,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e82c006d5a16d76cb299885cffb67da2?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/puzzlem00n/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11003-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11003-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11003-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11003-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11003-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11003-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11003-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11003-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/74538317/Adaption%20for%20Windows.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/74538317/Adaption%20for%20Mac.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/74538317/Adaption.love"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"innovation","rank":46,"score":3.41},{"area":"theme","rank":89,"score":3},{"area":"audio","rank":174,"score":2.24},{"area":"humor","rank":197,"score":1.72},{"area":"mood","rank":207,"score":2.23},{"area":"overall","rank":207,"score":2.63},{"area":"fun","rank":215,"score":2.27},{"area":"graphics","rank":266,"score":1.7}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Adventures of Hermanni","category":"compo","description":"This is a small 3D-platformer with puzzle elements.

Made some concept arts and it turned out to be quite an awesome idea. I started to implement basic functionality and realized that this is going to be too big. After that I tried to simplify this as much as possible, and after that simplification it turned to quite poor game :(, basic idea is still awesome - sidescrolling RTS with dynamic environment - but this can't be done in this time. So the lesson of this story. Plan and reason more before furious coding.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/8f13df9c98f7b802bb6452645e5e9908.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=4857","author":{"name":"Wukkopi","uid":4857,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/217e846ff28106adcdeaf05d397b4341?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/wukkopi/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4857-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4857-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/38684958/AntWars.rar"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/38684958/AntWars_Src.rar"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1171,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Arctic Upgrade","category":"jam","description":"An eskimo wakes up after feeling the earth shaking.

So everything is on the mouse.\n- Slowed down the pace of the auto drop\n- Added a stable square-block configuration, because sometimes you just want to put a block of live squares in the middle of the board\n- Made the drop shadow translucent\n\n\nThank you all for all of your feedback!

Watch randomly generated species, observe which seem to be the most successful\n\n* Click on/near a creature to view its stats\n* Generate new species with the new species button, see which survive to breed \n* Generate new terrain with the new terrain button if you get tired of the landscape.\nNote: Terrain generation takes a few seconds, be patient\n\nStats:\n  *TypeA, TypeB, TypeC: The creature's type represented by 3 numbers. These are converted to colors for display\n\n  *Health/Max: When health reaches 0, creature dies. Initially based on size.\n\n  *Food/Max: Goes down over time based on hunger, recovers based on digest when creature encounters food. If food goes below 0 health starts decreasing.\n\n  *Water/Max: Goes down over time, recovers when creature encounters water.\n\n  *Age/Max: Begins at 0, increases until it reaches max and creature dies.\n\n  *Drown/Max: Increases when creature encounters deep water, if it reaches max creature dies\n\n  *Decay/Max: Increases after death, when it reaches max the creature disappears completely\n\n  *Size: Base stat used to determine many other stats\n\n  *Speed: Maximum movement speed\n\n  *Aware: How often per second, on average, the creature checks its surroundings\n\n  *Sight: The maximum distance at which the creature is aware of other creatures\n\n  *Wander: How far the creature will wander away from its algorithmically determined destination\n\n  *Heal: Rate of health regeneration when well fed and watered\n\n  *Digest: Ability to digest grass\n\n  *Hunger: Rate at which food is consumed\n\n  *Social: Maximum distance creature tries to maintain with allies (lower means closer packed groups)\n\n  *Wary: Minimum distance creature tries to maintain with enemies\n\n  *Fear: Threshold of type difference to identify creature as enemy\n\n  *FearRnd: Randomization of fear on each check\n\n  *Swim: Ability to traverse water\n\n  *Climb: Ability to move up slopes\n\n  *Breed: Chance to reproduce each second\n\n  *Mutate: Drift of stats with each generation (higher mutate values decrease chance of successful birth)\n\n\nPost-Mortem\n\nMy original concept was to make an entire ecology of randomly generated species with recursive stats and random mutations which eventually would cause species to differentiate. Basically, faithfully reproducing the mechanisms of evolution in a game. On top of this, I planned to either cast the player as a curator/hunter, who would hunt the animals for food and also try to cull them or lead them in order to produce a healthy balance of animal populations.\n\nObviously, I didn't completely achieve those goals.\n\nI did, however, make a pretty good start, particularly considering the complexity of the idea (NEVER AGAIN) and the constraints of Ludum Dare.\n\nSo here's what IS in the game:\n\nRandom terrain generation: Creates height-map, populates it with water and grass\n\nRandom species generation: Creates stats within boundaries defined in code\n\nEating/drinking: I didn't have time to program meat consumption, so they all consume grass. If they don't encounter water soon enough they will start to die.\n\nSpecies breeding: When two animals of the same species meet, there is a chance they will breed. This produces a third animal with a slight mutation\n\nSpecies AI: Very simple, animals perceive each other and react. They will run towards allies and away from enemies based on their stat parameters. Species don't differentiate terrain at all, so be prepared to watch them drown themselves a lot and wander far away from food for no good reason.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/89d7b9a8661ef2052e79d7c32fe8e34a.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=854","author":{"name":"Problem Machine","uid":854,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/99bfd23b49b7236085bb3bfbf9dec30c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/kobel/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/854-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/854-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/100710544/LD24/evolution.swf"},{"label":"Web","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/100710544/LD24/evolution.swf"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/100710544/LD24/LD24.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":52},{"area":"theme","rank":139,"score":3.52},{"area":"innovation","rank":375,"score":2.84},{"area":"overall","rank":621,"score":2.48},{"area":"mood","rank":654,"score":1.87},{"area":"graphics","rank":668,"score":2.08},{"area":"fun","rank":743,"score":1.59}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Growing Tree","category":"compo","description":"Unfortunately I didn't have the whole 48 hours to work on it, so this is a very unpolished game, i apologize for that.\n\nThis is the first time i did Ludum dare , and also this is my first actual game :) , so you might not like it, but anyway I'm looking for your feedback, and wish you all best luck!\n\nAbout Game:\n\nI tried to make the player a growing arm of a tree, and water flows through it.

Each part of DNA allow you to improve your species and to make your cows stronger and gorgeous !\n\nYou first chose where to use your first 10 points of dna to start your species, then the game begin. There's also bonus stars that you can collect. When you've gathered 10 of them, you gain a bonus DNA point !\n\nYou can't attack wolves but you can defend yourselves. Put some DNA points in defenses to grow powerful horns and outnumber them by breeding new cows.\n\nEach turn (press ENTER to end the turn) all your cows regain there Action Points and can move again, and they produce food, in proportion of their remaining action points. Staying in grass allow them to build strong food ressources and to go on expedition in the dirt, when there's no food and where they can starve and die quickly ! Also a well fed cow is a more resillient cow against wolves.\n\n- Put points in Speed to have move Action Point per turn.\n- Put points in Food Production to eat the grass faster and make more personnal food supply quickly.\n- Put points in Food Consomation to have more starving resistant cows, that consume less food per turn.\n- Put points in Defense to get bigger and bigger horn that retaliate damages to wolves when they attack your cows.\n- Put points in Evade to lower the distances where wolves can see your cows.\n\nImportant - the remaining stats are not currently implemented and therefore are useless : Food cap, Temperature tolerance (also IMPORTANT : this one gives your cows a santa hat when 10 points are reached :-), Breed time, Starting specimens (I fixed it to 2 for this \"release\".\n\nHOW TO PLAY\nAt the begining of the level you've 2 cows to place on the map. Press space then click. The rest of the manipulation is pretty intuitive. Still :\n\nCows produce food each turn, in function of the soil and in function of their own eating skill.\nThey store this food in their stomach but meanwhile they consume a part of it each turn. The more they are evolved in food consomation, the less they consume. A starving cow that has no remaining food ressource dies sadly.\nA male and a female can breed a calf when they're both full of food. It consumes half of their ressources and put them out of action point until the end of the turn. Calf are cute and also defensless, wolves eat them instantly. Calves grow after 10 turns.\nYou can't attack wolves but you can eventually defeat them with a high defense skill. You can also blowk them with braves cow that will sacrifice to help the other ones to continue further on the map.\n\n\nNotes : All made in XNA C# with visual studio 10.

Games will get harder the better people play.\n\nThe game is written in HTML 5 and Javascript technologies. Our rendering layer is Canvas. The game will run across a wide variety of browsers and platforms. To support ghost saving and retrieval we pushed our website and service up to Azure. Our database is running on SQL Azure.\n\nAll of the code is original, even the Math libraries originally imported were mostly rewritten to improve the overall performance and feel of the game. We also created more than 95 unique images for use in the game.\n\nWe experimented with social integration as well so you can \"Like\" our game on Facebook or you can \"Tweet\" your scores. We hope that this allows you to see how your friends are doing and maybe find them flying against you. Each ghost is tagged with your user name so when you first hit the page make sure you enter your name. Everytime someone dies to your ghost they'll know it was you!\n\nThe entire process took 5 developers a little over 100 man hours totalling 11,000 lines of code churn.

And boy did we do much better this time around  (compared to the last one).\n\nThe last game we made together was very much sub-par at best.  We felt much better about this game.  We all worked really hard on it, and we hope you can tell.\n\nHaving said that - we didn't get to finish everything in that we wanted to - AND it's buggy!!!  First, you can't die - you just continue to loose points - second, the enemies only attack you once you attack them.\n\nSo, without further ado, here is our Ludum Dare game, ThroughOutTheAges.\n\nThere are four eras in the game.  Each equipped with different enemies and characters.  Collect enough EVO points to advance through the ages.  The goal of the game is to defeat all the enemies and evolve into the other ages.\n\nKeys - arrows or wasd to move around - 'E' a shortcut to evolve.\n\nMouse click on the enemies to fight - and to pick up items.\n\n'I' is your inventory.  You can equip items and take health potions.\n\nNot everything is polished (and there are lots of bugs and missing pieces!!) - but we hope you enjoy it none the less!\n\nThanks","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a1692b09cda7369a53cb29231ddc3458.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=6533","author":{"name":"sampyxis","uid":6533,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/362f1f6f8365a617e0aa7c5f119d0b9c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/sampyxis/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/6533-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/6533-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/LD48/ThroughTheAges/ThroughTheAges.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/LD48/ThroughTheAges/index.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/LD48/ThroughTheAges/ThroughTheAges.gmx.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":61},{"area":"theme","rank":130,"score":2.78},{"area":"humor","rank":186,"score":1.79},{"area":"audio","rank":187,"score":2.03},{"area":"mood","rank":200,"score":2.3},{"area":"graphics","rank":207,"score":2.52},{"area":"innovation","rank":238,"score":2.09},{"area":"overall","rank":242,"score":2.33},{"area":"fun","rank":243,"score":2.03}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Transmogrify","category":"compo","description":"Transmogrify is a shmup in which both the player and enemy evolve.

There is also a parameter panel that allows modification of several key tank parameters.  With these and many other features, we're sure you'll find that it is a joy to evolve your SLT-2200R Robo-Tank into the workhorse you'll love.\n\nThe goal in this training simulation is to retrieve all gold boxes from each level and spend as little time in \"Manual Mode\" as possible. If you spend more time in manual mode than the level's par time, you will have to play the level again.\n\nWhen a level loads it is recommended that you press the spacebar and put the tank in auto pilot mode. When a condition occurs that requires your attention, the tank will switch back into manual mode. Check the Action text at the bottom of the screen. If it is visible, it will tell you if an action needs to be recorder. To record an action, simply press 'R' until the \"Mode\" indicator indicates record mode. Perform the desired action, then either hit spacebar, or 'R' again to return. When an action is recorded for a condition, anytime the autopilot encounters that condition again, it will playback your recorded moves.  Note: Recording an action counts towards your Manual mode time.\n\nControls: \n\n<Spacebar> Toggles between manual mode and auto pilot\nE: Erase a previously-recorded action. (This can be done \n   in either mode.)\n<ESC>: Returns to intro screen\nS: Restarts a level\nP: Pause the game and access the tanks configurable parameters (these changes persist across levels)\n\nIn Manual mode:\n\nArrow Keys: Movement\nF: Fire (you can kill turrets with 3 shots)\nR: Record a control sequence for the currently shown action (if no action is shown, record mode cannot be entered)\n\nRemember, each level (except the last) has a maximum par time that you must be under in order to advance.\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/0b7c8d37cd4f7aa38bc6cbb873956b3b.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=1105","author":{"name":"recursor","uid":1105,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c9c3dca8879cc03848a3896980d10e4e?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/recursor/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1105-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1105-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1105-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1105-shot1.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1105-shot2.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1105-shot2.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://proto.pixelbytestudios.com/jams/MagnaSystems/MagnaSystems.php"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://console.writeline.net/my_stuff/LD/24/LD24MagnaSystems_src.unitypackage"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":75},{"area":"audio","rank":117,"score":3.24},{"area":"innovation","rank":126,"score":3.49},{"area":"mood","rank":129,"score":3.16},{"area":"humor","rank":132,"score":2.94},{"area":"overall","rank":467,"score":2.79},{"area":"graphics","rank":523,"score":2.51},{"area":"fun","rank":645,"score":2.13},{"area":"theme","rank":648,"score":2.08}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Oculus Battalion","category":"compo","description":"Capture enemy slimes and eyeballs to use as your own soldiers in this wave based horde surivival game.

I found it very easy to add in variables and whatnot, although unfortunately there's no \"else if\" type of scripting in there - something that made implementing the endings an exercise in \"Screw it - just list 'em all!\"\n\nWith some more tweaking to twine, and addition of some sort of inventory and combat mechanics (beyond simple variable storage) I could see it really being the best way to make online Zork-like games. \n\n\nNext game I'd love to do one with actual graphics. I had designs of doing little silly doodles to add along with all the passages but time cut me short on that front.\n\nThis was really fun to make, and hope to have a much better entry next time around. This is silly, and barely touches on evolution (that theme really threw me for a loop) but it's here and it's done.

If you're getting 'dead pixels' and don't know why, it's because you're mixing too many different colors.\n- You need to collect a certain count of each color to advance to the next round, watch the numbers at the top to see what to go for next.\n- If you've got something selected and you just want to look around, click off the current selection first (otherwise you'll end up throwing it).\n\nIn general, I think the goals need to be simpler and read better, and input needs to be more predictable.  I also have some ideas for how to possibly turn this into more of a puzzle, and remove some of the frustrating bits.\n\nI will be iterating on this idea to try to turn it into more of a complete, polished game, and hopefully taking it to the app stores.

We locked them up \nin cages, held them in captivity, and milked them dry. All that time, \nwe were unaware that they were waiting for their savior.\n\nIn an ancient prophecy by Cowstradamus, it was foretold that one cow \nwould rise up to make a difference and liberate the bovine species from \nthe evil clutches of mankind.\n\nAnd now, one cow has appeared that is slightly different from the \nothers; he is the One Cow. One Cow to rule them all. And in his heart, \nhe thinks: \"What is a man? A miserable ape!\"\n\nAbout the game\n--------------\nA humoristic semi-stealth game, in the vein of the first Metal Gear \nor the classic Castle Wolfenstein.\n\nAt the start screen, press any key to begin the game.\n\nThe goal of the game is to kill all the humans.

I've learned about the Heike Crabs and how their shells were shaped over time to resemble the faces of Japanese warriors. I've created a simulation where cells of different hues are floating around in a square petri dish. If you hold down the mouse button and drag over the cells, they would be killed and instantly be replaced by a copy of a random cell, thus representing the offspring that would replace it. Eventually, if you're selective in your approach, you'll end up with a field of similar cells.

For an example of the EVOLUTION system, you can enter the CODE 'TRANSFER FINAL FIRE GRID' to access one of the pre-made DIGIEVO CREATUREs.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/39de647f4562e987d3f6a40c15f3c13e.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=7284","author":{"name":"VDZ","uid":7284,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/26422423b48afe21462f11a319d735cf?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/vdz/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7284-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7284-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7284-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7284-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7284-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7284-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7284-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7284-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7284-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7284-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows/XNA","url":"http://vdzserver.org/misc/DIGIEVO.RAR"},{"label":"Mirror #1","url":"http://www.stack.nl/~vdz/misc/DIGIEVO.RAR"},{"label":"Mirror #2 (MediaFire)","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?dj58sxdydom8dht"},{"label":"Updated version (not for judging)","url":"http://vdzserver.org/misc/DIGIEVOV2.RAR"},{"label":"Source (SVN, Visual Studio 2010 Express, C#/XNA)","url":"http://vdzserver.org/ld24/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":29,"score":4},{"area":"audio","rank":124,"score":3.21},{"area":"innovation","rank":145,"score":3.43},{"area":"fun","rank":229,"score":3.07},{"area":"overall","rank":246,"score":3.2},{"area":"graphics","rank":372,"score":2.93},{"area":"coolness","rank":888,"score":30}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Edric Garran's Amazing Shooter","category":"compo","description":"This is what I could get to of the game.\nThere are a few bugs, and no binary release for now (sorry).\n\nYou move the blue blob and shoot things at the green blobs.

Radiation is responsible for mutation of all genetic material and plays a big role in evolution. But too much radiation will destroy every organism!\n\nUse the mouse to move (left button) and rotate (right button) the different deflectors to shield your cell as well as possible and reflect the incoming gamma rays away.\n\nRepair your DNA by quickly pressing the letters (ACGT) popping up at the center. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACGT)\n\nThe game could use some more work (especially the audio sucks), but I'm quite happy with what I achieved and I had tons of fun (and also a little frustration ^^').\n\nHave fun playing and see you next time!

It's been tiring, but really interesting.\n\nBasically, what we have here is a sandbox where we can see a population of creatures hang around, feed and, at fixed intervals, mate (or generate mutant clones of doom, if they're asexual). Creatures can generate the energy they need, or they may get it from eating nutrients or other creatures.\n\nMy idea was to make a \"god game\" where you could use some powers to get a population satisfying a set of conditions (for example..get 3 blue carnivores) after a given number of generations. Powers would be things such as...exterminate an individual, increase the life degradation rate temporarily, create/remove natural nutrients (the small, still dots). Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to achieve that and lots of things that I thought about, but I guess this is OK for a couple of days (shared between programming and gaming ^^). \n\nMore details on the readme file included in the *.zip.

It's a wacky, wavy, inflatable, arm-flailing tube game page warehouse and imporium!!! So I wanted to make a game about the evolution (thus natural selection) of the single celled organism world. But alas, I spent WAY to much time watching Dr. Who. So my game is only half done, a little bit broken, and I had to implement the scoring system at the very end.\n\nThe goal(now) is to keep away from the big cells, but murder the small cells. You can of course attack whomever you want tho. If your health reaches zero, you die, obviously. :O\n\nThe cells do have the ability to mutate(which you do not), and they do follow loose guidelines of natural selection. Now because of how the AI is coded, they tend to look like they are just randomly moving about (which I guess sometimes they are) but for the most part they are hunting, or fleeing. Because they mutate, they can and WILL get stronger faster and bigger. But it's quite interesting to sometimes see the small quick ones escape detection and rapidly grow their numbers. But beware, sometimes small ones can be VERY strong.\n\nNote!!: I have a 2.something ghz cpu, and once cellular count reached, around 500, I was getting under 30fps. Sorry :(\n\nEnjoy!! \n\nP.S.

If that doesn't solve the problem, experiment with different 'Graphics filter' options - it may be that the game is trying to run in a resolution too high/low for your graphics adapter.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n=== SPECIAL THANKS ===\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n* Members of the Freesound project, for providing quality audio samples:\nalister667, Andreas.Mustola, avakas, CJ4096, D W, digifishmusic,\nengreitz, Flasher21, FreqMan, joedeshon, JoelAudio, junggle,\nkineticturtle, KNO SFX, Lunardrive, mattwasser, Nathan Lomeli,\nnmscher, NoiseCollector, Percy Duke, roper1911, RutgerMuller,\nsagetyrtle, sandyrb, shawshank73, Slanesh, SpiderJerusalem,\nSrehpog, suonho, thedapperdan, Tomlija, TreasureBoxFilms,\ntweeterdj, wildweasel, YvesSch & Zoltan Csengeri.\n\n* Kevin MacLeod, for giving away thousands of amazing music tracks for free.\n\n* Chris Jones, for creating the Adventure Game Studio engine.\n\n* Ron Gilbert, Tim Schafer, Charles Cecil, and other industry luminaries, for creating some of the classic adventure games which inspire us.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/fd1ddb50bd1e1515a3ba584a5405ec05.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=7835","author":{"name":"MurrayL","uid":7835,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f4dc020c808961eab2139e5f5594cf6b?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/murrayl/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7835-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7835-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7835-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7835-shot1.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7835-shot2.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7835-shot2.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7835-shot3.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7835-shot3.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7835-shot4.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7835-shot4.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows -

In our modern day, it's easy to take the security and comfort of modern airplanes for granted--like how the WASD controls and overwhelming firepower for a shoot'em up has become pretty much standard. So I attempted to hark back to humble beginnings to show the limitations and frustrations of earlier aircraft and how aviation became what it is now. \n\nOh, and there's a boss at the end somewhere. \n\n[Tip: To dodge the double attack, I've been going right then left (or vice versa depending on his position), cutting between bullets with the glider.

I made the classical error: Too ambitious for my experience and time. I didn't have time to add proper sfx or music. Also the game lacks a bit of polish. More about this tomorrow with the Post Mortem.\n\nThe game: As I have no knowledge about DNA, biology and so, I decided that given that Evolution took so long to be a Ludum Dare theme... what if Evolution itself fights against the previous LD themes? It has been in the final round 7 times and 9 voted, that's 9 levels!\n\nEvery mini-level is inspired by one past LD theme, as can be seen on the top-left corner of the screen. Plus a last level surprise not inspired in any past them, but with which Evolution has got to fight til the last blood drop :)\n\nHOW TO PLAY: \nYou have to collect a letter from the word EVOLUTION in each level. When the letter is picked up, a door opens to the next level. The first level can be tricky, but just think about finding the first letter. By the way, the game gets a little better after the first mini-level :)\n\nControls: Sometimes cursors, sometimes mouse, sometimes both of them:)\n\nHope you enjoy it!\n\nUPDATE: Ok, looks like the first level is not so obvious so, as I want you pals to play the game, here's the trick: Place objects clicking around and hit the \"Boom\" button. Check the screenshot!\n\nUPDATE 2: Crap, it seems like there was some z-fighting issue with the \"Next\" button after winning the first scene! On my Intel card the button was shown in front of the dark plane, but on nvidia, it was rendered behind... Please check it again!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ced1e48569cc197c7c5f1f98a294ab88.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=5049","author":{"name":"DavidErosa","uid":5049,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/21de20b393f84384a101dcf6bb21e0be?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/derosa/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5049-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5049-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5049-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5049-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5049-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5049-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5049-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5049-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5049-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5049-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web - Unity Player","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9960039/ld24/ThePathforEvolution/ThePathForEvolution.html"},{"label":"Gameplay video","url":"http://youtu.be/jVTJmGGCYzg"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/derosa/ld24"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":54},{"area":"humor","rank":155,"score":2.83},{"area":"innovation","rank":372,"score":2.85},{"area":"mood","rank":384,"score":2.62},{"area":"overall","rank":399,"score":2.93},{"area":"theme","rank":452,"score":2.69},{"area":"graphics","rank":475,"score":2.62},{"area":"audio","rank":506,"score":1.96},{"area":"fun","rank":528,"score":2.46}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Vesuvius","category":"compo","description":"Vesuvius is a game in which you evolve not by beating enemies but by suffering.\n\nLeft and Right arrow key to move.

(don't need to go to my site and download it anymore)\n\nThis was built for linux and android, the windows version is a port and my engine is not yet very well tested under windows so there may be some bugs! Please rate the other two versions if possible.\n\nthe android version may take a few hours to show up in google play as well.\n\nThis is a simple action rpg operated entirely by the mouse (linux and windows) or touch (android).  Kill enemies and you will start to evolve parts of your body into parts of theirs (don't kill too many blobs or you'll be stuck a blob for a long time!)  Parts can freely mix and match.\n\nSee if you can survive and make it to the end!  (There IS an end, and it will be obvious when you see it that you need to go there)\n\nQuick Evolution Tips:\n* Fighting a single enemy too much has the potential to de-evolve traits you have gotten from other enemies\n* There are three \"visible\" traits in your evolution, head, body, and back.  Body in general determines your base defense and attack speed, head determines your base damage and range, back(wings) lets you fly at different speeds depending on wing type\n* everything has a tradeoff, for instance a heavy body like the wolfrat has higher defense but will be slower than a lightweight bird body,\n* there are more \"invisible\" traits, that unfortunately i did not have time to sprite.  Legs provide a speed boost and can be obtained from any creature that has them (bird,wolf,spider). The bird legs are slow but faster than having none (blob), wolf is fast and spider is fastest.\n* the second \"invisible\" trait is skin type, you start as \"naked\" type which has no stat changes at all (blob is essentially \"pure\" no modifiers on all stats), you can evolve hair from wolves, scales from snakes, and feathers from birds, hair has a minor defense bonus, scales has a major defense bonus, and feathers has a speed bonus.  Again, they ARE there you just cant see them due to time constraints cutting my spriting short.\n* the third invisible property is venom sacs, you either have them or not, you can evolve them from either spider or snake DNA, they cuase enemies to harm themselves when they attempt to attack you after you've hit them at least once\n* the last invisible property is the bat's echolocation, which brightens up the rooms, this is only obtainable by bats and is the only property that CANT de-evolve once you have it\n\nOverall there are 36 unique body combinations for your creature that are visible (modular sprites, it mixes and matches them based on your current statistics), in all there are 2304  different combinations of abilities so how you play and what you attack and in what order can have a very VERY drastic effect on how the game plays for you.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e66eb7e69e55164a184bc3b9be203e93.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=7131","author":{"name":"Raptor85","uid":7131,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/889da19b195d7fa15659072f2221036d?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/raptor85/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7131-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7131-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7131-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7131-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7131-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7131-shot2.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7131-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7131-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Linux x86-64","url":"http://www.midnightfragfest.com/wp-content/plugins/download-monitor/download.php?id=18"},{"label":"video","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdBU31BtFOs"},{"label":"windows","url":"http://www.midnightfragfest.com/wp-content/plugins/download-monitor/download.php?id=20"},{"label":"android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.raptor85.genome"},{"label":"source","url":"http://www.midnightfragfest.com/wp-content/plugins/download-monitor/download.php?id=19"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"theme","rank":67,"score":3.83},{"area":"innovation","rank":203,"score":3.23},{"area":"audio","rank":227,"score":2.82},{"area":"overall","rank":353,"score":3.02},{"area":"fun","rank":421,"score":2.7},{"area":"humor","rank":430,"score":1.91},{"area":"mood","rank":438,"score":2.51},{"area":"graphics","rank":453,"score":2.67}],"platforms":["linux","desktop","win","mobile"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Sweet Argon","category":"compo","description":"This game really, really sucks.

You control organisms with the ability to drain health from each other, and create stronger children from their own health.\n\nYou win if your hue is dominant, you lose if you die and there are no more organisms with your hue to take control of.\n\nCONTROLS:\n* WASD - move\n* Left click - drain health from other organisms (if you are not full)\n* Right click - repair an organism or create a new one\n\n* b - colour-blind mode (brighter organisms are closer to your hue)\n* n - disable birth sound (bleep bloop)\n\nGUIDE:\n* your health is the portion of colour within your hexagonal border\n* if you die, you take control of an ally\n* if you are low on health, left click on enemy organisms to stealth their health\n* if you have high (especially full) health, right click on the ground to create offspring, or on an ally organism to heal it\n* win by stealing health from other colours and converting it into babies of your colour\n\nNOTES:\nThe idea was originally to have a heavier emphasis on creating better offspring, but as it stands offspring are only a slight improvement on their parents. Offspring have a slightly different hue from their parents, so distant relations in the family tree will not necessarily be allies!\n\nThe bleeps and bloops are the sound of organisms being born! The lower the pitch, the less alike to you they are. The other sound warns you when you are low on health, or too full to attack.\n\nWith more time, I'd ideally make the organism AI better - they ought to run away when in danger, and create children away from enemies who are likely to consume them immediately.\n\nPOST COMPO FIXES:\n* Collision - organisms now collide loosely, preventing too many organisms swarming in the same place\n* Input fixes - clicking on organisms is now more reliable\n* Sound fix - the sound no longer repeats after the game ends\n* AI changes - organisms now try to run to safety to replicate, and find enemies to kill more easily\n\nREFERENCES:\nMade using love2d (https://love2d.org/) - the .love is just a renamed .zip of the source.\n\nFont from http://www.fontspace.com/digitaldreamdesign/d3-honeycombism","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c1f8eddc16be615d597c0e2f9e1d0a70.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=13822","author":{"name":"Ragzouken","uid":13822,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4deeab37b2bc4ef091be3460618abb2a?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/ragzouken/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13822-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13822-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13822-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13822-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13822-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13822-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13822-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13822-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13822-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13822-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://you.mongle.me/ld48/survive.zip"},{"label":"LOVE (Mac/Linux)","url":"http://you.mongle.me/ld48/survive.love"},{"label":"Video","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKvx3aQXMHs"},{"label":"love2d (use with LOVE)","url":"https://love2d.org/"},{"label":"Windows (POST COMPO)","url":"http://you.mongle.me/love/survive.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"innovation","rank":72,"score":3.66},{"area":"graphics","rank":147,"score":3.56},{"area":"theme","rank":177,"score":3.43},{"area":"mood","rank":242,"score":2.91},{"area":"overall","rank":249,"score":3.19},{"area":"fun","rank":307,"score":2.91},{"area":"audio","rank":443,"score":2.19},{"area":"humor","rank":449,"score":1.86}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"The Debate","category":"jam","description":"It's pong between Darwin and Jesus.

Your goal is to find and collect the 5 hidden fallen stars. You can evolve by collecting Red, Blue, Purple, and Green orbs. BUT, you can only evolve 7 times per character. (i.e. you can only collect 7 orbs before having to restart.) You will have to evolve yourself in different ways to get all the stars!\n\nI'm very happy I was able to finish my game on my first entry into the competition! I think the thing I struggled most with is teaching or explaining to the player how to play the game, as it can be a tad confusing. I also couldn't think of a more fitting name. Everything else should be fine though. If you get stuck or confused, the help.txt file might be helpful. There's an easter egg hidden somewhere on the map, which shouldn't be to hard to find. Also, there's an ending cinematic if you collect all five stars :) Enjoy!\n\nIF THE GAME FREEZES AFTER THE TUTORIAL:\nI'm sorry this happens. At this point, the game creates and modifies a bunch of objects for the main level, all in one go. If the game freezes, and doesn't crash, try waiting a while. On my computer it only takes about 5 seconds, and on others I've seen it take like 10 or 15 seconds, and that's the only solution I can think of. Maybe you could try waiting a minute or more. Sorry again.\n\nI apologize for not being able to port the game to OS/X or Linux, but if you're on a mac you can try Wine. And if the game crashes on Windows, please try to tell me when or what causes the game to crash, and the error message. Thanks a lot.\n\nAbout the source:\nI'm really sorry, but I do not believe the source of the game is available. I've tried opening it in Construct Classic 0.98.9, r1.1, and r1.2, and it just gives an error of \"this game was made in a newer version of construct.\" If you really want to see the source, I can send you some backups I made during development, so you could see if those work. Or if you have any questions about the code, I would be happy to explain stuff to you. Just let me know. Also, the source still does contain the graphics and sound effects, so you can still have those if you want them.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ab1183c28c8c332723e10335ddba380c.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14266","author":{"name":"patrickgh3","uid":14266,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/507cc0d663d4afc35862aac197b1098e?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/patrickgh3/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14266-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14266-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14266-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14266-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14266-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14266-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14266-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14266-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14266-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14266-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?gxh4c1i4o08b5q5"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?5496421d724d1a8"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":77},{"area":"overall","rank":67,"score":3.65},{"area":"fun","rank":79,"score":3.5},{"area":"mood","rank":145,"score":3.11},{"area":"innovation","rank":188,"score":3.26},{"area":"theme","rank":193,"score":3.38},{"area":"graphics","rank":275,"score":3.17},{"area":"humor","rank":383,"score":2.05},{"area":"audio","rank":443,"score":2.19}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Growth","category":"jam","description":"Click to move.

This is my first time entering any competition for a game, When I started the game I ran into a big problem. Windows stopped working, I didn't have time to reinstall it, so I moved to linux, However never doing images in linux, and trying to create images using a Inkscape I had never used before was a disaster! After staying up all night trying to create images that look terrible. I had wasted a good portion of a day and didn't have much to show for it. So I got to coding not knowing what I would do about images, then I ran into another problem, linux wasn't picking up keyStrocks in Applet(I was trying to use applet instead of my usual graphics because everyone like game you don't have to download) Finally I got keystroks to work in eclipse but when I uploaded my first game to the website keystrock stopped working on linux, at that point I just went to bed. Overall it was a disaster... But I still wanted to enter something so I can vote. Sorry for how bad the game is.

Looking at it may ruin the fun of the discovery of all the ways for a cell to evolve, but will also make sure you found them all. Look at it if you want, it isn't an official part of the game.\n\nThe post-compo version is slightly better. The changes are as follows:\n- implemented 'halo' around changing cells ( I had wanted to do this but ran out of time).\n- prevented an error that occasionally prevents one from getting past wave two of level one.\n- added support for skipping dialog with <enter>.\n- added support for visiting past dialog with <backspace>.\n- fixed some text errors in the dialog.\n- added 'fastforward' button that will remove the cap on fps and allow the simulation to run faster (if your computer sucks it won't run any faster).\n- fixed turrets spawning wrong (in the original code I accidently switched the data value for 'kind' with data value for 'wavespawn' making a basic turret that should spawn in wave two spawn as a machinegun turret in wave one).\n- added the identity of the mysterious static at the end of level five!

One might venture to say that I enjoy torturing those who only want to be helpful and rate my game ;)\n\nA game where you control a young protagonist named Violet in her search for a cat that she finds too fluffy to resist.\n\nOn this journey, she will encounter a large population of signs and other curious yet naturally occurring lethal deathtraps, and eventually (read, at the end of the game) learn a useful lesson about evolution: That it's terrible.\n\nControls are all explained in game, but only if you don't figure it out yourself. I aimed to have a tutorial system that doesn't treat the player like a three year old.\n\nFeatures:\n- 40 levels of increasingly difficult platforming spread across 4 different areas. The platforming is based off jumps, double jumps, wall jumps, and even placing your own blocks. There is also a workaround allowing you to skip levels if you have failed them a lot.\n- An intuitive tutorial built into the early levels, allowing to to figure the game out on your own if you can, and helping you if you can't\n- A soundtrack straight out of Hollywood, heavily orchestral, albeit a little short, and sound effects which fit in with the music.\n- Cloth physics based graphics allowing for your character to have a dynamic hairstyle and dress.\n- A level select which remembers what levels you have beaten , even if you quit the game.\n- A perverted signpost and several Marilyn Monroe moments\n- A terrible \"I really hate this theme\" last minute storyline.\n- A cat. 'Nuff said.\n\nA walkthrough will be coming up in the near future.\nA level editor will also be released shortly afterwards.\n\nKNOWN BUGS:\n-Sometimes you will lose a placeable block for no apparent reason\n-You can trap yourself in a freshly placed block \n\nThe game was made in Gamemaker 8.0 pro in case any of you want to check the

Thanks for playing!\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/24da15e25147ec52c516b6949c2032e3.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14930","author":{"name":"PickledBrain","uid":14930,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/245fdb1b0dffc47589c4bd9bd8b71598?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/pickledbrain/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14930-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14930-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14930-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14930-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14930-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14930-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14930-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14930-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14930-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14930-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.pickledbrain.co/FlashGames/Pixelomoeba/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":61},{"area":"innovation","rank":23,"score":3.67},{"area":"fun","rank":48,"score":3.44},{"area":"overall","rank":50,"score":3.5},{"area":"theme","rank":79,"score":3.12},{"area":"graphics","rank":152,"score":3.06},{"area":"audio","rank":173,"score":2.25},{"area":"mood","rank":204,"score":2.25},{"area":"humor","rank":214,"score":1.42}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Red Goo Zombies, or, You Have Been Selected to Die, Naturally","category":"jam","description":"Defeat the legions of red goo zombies.

But then I missed it and had to switch to the 3 day jam.\n\nThis idea randomly came to me and I decided to just work with it making it up as I went along.\n\nThe basic Idea is that you have a family of slugs that you try to evolve into better slugs. You have to try to keep them alive then get them to mate with other slugs to get better slugs that can do better skills so you can keep them alive. \n\nYou can train the slugs to do different jobs but it costs resources to train them. The jobs starve the slugs and sometimes use resources to do the different jobs. \n\nYou also have to watch out for the salt storms. If one hits one of your slugs then it has a chance to partially starve that slug. \n\nIf you have soldiers the stronger they are reduces the chance that a slug will be starved, also making a blacksmith work to make better stuff for your soldiers will reduce the chance that a slug is starved by a salt storm. \n\nA farmer will take 1 resource and be starved by 2 points to make food depending on its strength. \n\nA Miner will be starved by 3 points to make resources depending on its strength. \n\nA blacksmith will take up 4 food and 10 resources to decrease the chance that a slug will be starved by a salt storm depending on its strength. \n\nThe color of the slugs have nothing to do with its skills. Mating 2 slugs will take 5 resources and create a new slug with different skills.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b11449b587a54aa478eed0a17eb1c7fb.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=10685","author":{"name":"Jogy34","uid":10685,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a290069b1cd604ea3bb24dfb7e89b6e8?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/jogy34-2/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10685-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10685-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10685-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10685-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10685-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10685-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10685-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10685-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?ujxx8x1wpylmwx9"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?20jpulvt4hca6wp"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1040,"score":17}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Super

(Note that, as in Magic: The Gathering, ending your turn resets your mana to zero!)\n* Mouse over a slug or a spell to see its stats.\n* *** If you get stuck (such as by entering Magic Mode or Drop Mode without any slugs in your inventory), in the post-compo version, you can press escape to end your turn. ***\n\nSPELLS:\n* Lightning: 1 mana. Kills exactly one target slug.\n* Hand: 5 mana. Puts the target slug in your inventory.\n* Fire: 10 mana. Kills all slugs in the target square and all adjacent squares.\n* Dawn (unimplemented): 100 mana. Ascend to godhood and remake the world in your image.\n\nSTATS\n* Mana: the amount of mana you receive for eating this slug.\n* Docility (TAME): the slug's aversion to fights. Slugs with low TAME will frequently kill slugs around them (but not you, for they are lowly slugs and you a mighty Slugmage!)\n* Perseverance (PERS): the slug's attention span. Slugs with low PERS will frequently switch targets.\n* Weight (WGHT): currently no effect. Originally, the Slugmage was to have a weight limit, so that slugs would have to be bred for low weight in addition to high mana yield.\n* In addition, each slug has a color that is derived from its weight (green), docility (red -- low docility means HIGH red!), and mana yield (blue). Slugs with radically differing colors will have trouble mating.\n\nMONSTERS\nMonsters in Slugmage, as lesser beings than yourself, cannot harm you. However, as they are the main source of the mana with which you exert your divine presence, you would do well to learn about them.\n* Font of Life: actually a type of venerable slug, Fonts give up their mobility in exchange for independence and asexual reproduction. Fonts remain capable of sexual reproduction (but cannot initiate it) and grant renewed life to weary slugs around them.\n* Slug: a stupid creature that has nothing better to do than chase random other monsters. Slugs require constant rejuvenation from their home font, and will return to it when they begin to shrivel up. Certain slugs with low perseverance may give up their futile chasing altogether to become Fonts.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/f371e3e4408b8727200035c8e6c51612.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14121","author":{"name":"triliyn","uid":14121,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/61226ce011ec53a878f3accd5726c0b8?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/triliyn/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14121-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14121-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.box.com/s/7efb752ebbc2abc57acf"},{"label":"Windows (post-compo)","url":"http://triliyn.banseljaj.com/slugmage.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":74},{"area":"innovation","rank":97,"score":3.06},{"area":"theme","rank":129,"score":2.79},{"area":"humor","rank":133,"score":2.23},{"area":"audio","rank":196,"score":1.69},{"area":"mood","rank":234,"score":1.84},{"area":"overall","rank":247,"score":2.26},{"area":"fun","rank":262,"score":1.76},{"area":"graphics","rank":271,"score":1.48}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Conway's Revenge","category":"compo","description":"My entry for Ludum Dare #24, with the theme of Evolution, is the game Conway's Revenge.\n\nIt is essentially Conway's Game of Life (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) modified to work with multiple opposing teams of cellular automata. The rules of reproduction have been tweaked to make the game more interesting and 'game-like' by preventing deadlock scenarios and making sure it's not too hard to get your cells to grow and expand.\n\nIt has three game modes planned, two of which are implemented:\n\n  1.  Campaign - A set of puzzle levels where you face off against progressively more difficult enemy formations (unimplemented).\n  2.  Battle Royale - A bloody melee between four different teams of cellular automata. The grid is initialized with a random pattern, perfect for conflict!\n  3.  Sandbox - A blank slate for you to explore and test your own creations with up to four different teams.\n\nTry it out and let me know what you think!\n\nThe official project page (including links to the source) for Conway's Revenge is here: http://nickknowlson.com/projects/conways-revenge/\n\nCheck out my journal entries for the post-mortem.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/060cd539cab88db11b4902fdf8595d64.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=15084","author":{"name":"Nick Knowlson","uid":15084,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c507dbbdb42f0d55bba25c620cf75314?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/nickknw/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15084-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15084-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15084-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15084-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15084-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15084-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15084-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15084-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15084-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15084-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://nickknowlson.com/projects/conways-revenge/flash/"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/nickknw/ludum-dare-24"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":60},{"area":"theme","rank":114,"score":3.6},{"area":"innovation","rank":364,"score":2.86},{"area":"overall","rank":467,"score":2.79},{"area":"humor","rank":518,"score":1.68},{"area":"fun","rank":563,"score":2.37},{"area":"mood","rank":597,"score":2.17},{"area":"graphics","rank":623,"score":2.24},{"area":"audio","rank":626,"score":1.05}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Crow Evolution","category":"jam","description":"Multiplayer game with REAL EVOLUTION OF GENES!\nThere is one world with 1000 respawning crows for all players.\nEach NPC have genetic code that affects behavior, speed, skills and outfit.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/4c2092aa9f41b94708407e46e9b5617c.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=10579","author":{"name":"myachin","uid":10579,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/289ff70658d9635fe25c9d45fd42a8a1?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/myachin/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10579-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10579-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://old48.com/games/crow/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://github.com/prograess/LD24"}],"ratings":[{"area":"humor","rank":134,"score":2.22},{"area":"audio","rank":163,"score":2.32},{"area":"graphics","rank":210,"score":2.5},{"area":"theme","rank":224,"score":2.04},{"area":"innovation","rank":232,"score":2.13},{"area":"fun","rank":232,"score":2.13},{"area":"mood","rank":235,"score":1.83},{"area":"overall","rank":242,"score":2.33},{"area":"coolness","rank":667,"score":44}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Cubic Evolution","category":"jam","description":"Evolve the cube from something drab to something FABULOUS! ;)\n\nI am not going to put instructions here, but rather, let people figure it out.

Web version is available now; additional builds/media will be available sometime tomorrow.\n\nI guess I missed the window for the regular competition?  I swear that in the past there was a grace period for making the submission itself; but the option isn't there.  Oh well I guess.\n\nHope some people enjoy the game!\n\nEDIT: Going to put instructions here after all.\n\nThe objective of the game is to evolve the cube.  After a certain amount of time, cubes on the larger cube will start flashing.  Clicking on the flashing cubes breaks them up and sends them to the orbiting nodes.  At any time, you can click on an orbiting node to transfer the cube energy inside of it to the main cube.\n\nClicking the flashing cubes fast enough, and without clicking non-flashing cubes, will start a combo (Shown in the upper left).  Higher combos increases the rate at which cubes start to flash.  It's 5 cubes per multiplier, and you have 5 seconds between cubes before the multiplier resets.  Hitting a non-flashing cube resets your combo.\n\nI had intended to put a time element in the game so that there's some point/competition but it's not in there, maybe use a stopwatch? ;)  It's a silly game anyway, but it was fun to make and maybe with some love it could become something greater.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/847e60298df57bc9b84b1528cc6b7b26.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=2023","author":{"name":"drakfyre","uid":2023,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/434ad30dfd03c0e5204cf9b6eda38930?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/drakfyre/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2023-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2023-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2023-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2023-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2023-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2023-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2023-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2023-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://content.drakfyre.com/pushypixels/CubicEvolution/CubicEvolution.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6741768/LD24.zip"},{"label":"Video Coverage","url":"http://www.cookingwithunity.com/videos"},{"label":"Time Lapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXGSwYUbuRY&list=UUE_zXCWrBsb4wvpHu3FjFTw&index=1&feature=plcp"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":93,"score":3.08},{"area":"graphics","rank":138,"score":3.17},{"area":"overall","rank":218,"score":2.58},{"area":"fun","rank":230,"score":2.17},{"area":"theme","rank":234,"score":1.92},{"area":"coolness","rank":1112,"score":10}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Fit to Fight","category":"compo","description":"I am not quite sure if my entry is valid.

Keep the enemies from becoming too specialized at wrecking your defensive turrets by juggling them like a pro.\n\nInstructions (now with a gameplay video):\n\nThe round object at the left is a generator, which your job is to protect. Use your mouse to connect it to turrets - left-click to draw and right-click to cut a wire. \n\nThere are three genes in play: red, green, and blue. \n-While an enemy is attacked by a turret with its color, it's immune to damage.\n-When an enemy is killed by a turret, the enemy gene pool adapts to the turret's color by one fitness point, meaning that enemies of that color become more common.\n-Additionally, an enemy gene levels up after every 4 fitness points, spawning more powerful enemies. Namely, the blue gene will give more health, the green one more range, and the red one more attack power.\n\nYou can also take advantage of genes.\n-A turret that kills an enemy adds the enemy's gene to its gene bank. \n-A turret's gene bank can hold 3 genes. \n-The cumulative genes of all turrets _connected to the generator_ can be used to build more turrets in the white slots. Select the genotype of the turret by clicking on the bottom left colors; then connect a white slot to the generator and click on it. Building a turret costs 1 gene of its color.\n-Additionally, if a turret's gene bank has 3 same genes in a row, you can level up that gene by clicking on the turret and pressing the double helix button. Turrets built after that will be more powerful in the same manner as enemies.\n\nKnowing all that, try to keep the enemy gene pool in control by strategically connecting and disconnecting turrets from the generator. The goal is simply to survive as long as you can; your score is the amount of enemies killed.\n\nIt's challenging but addictive - just the way I like my games - so don't give up.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/9bef415efaa3f5d14f2f79dc8101998a.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=5551","author":{"name":"Jiggawatt","uid":5551,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d77bce3a74261db623f82b2af88a2587?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/ointment/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5551-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5551-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/s/hf1nt3jfr7mkcyi/MPC.rar?dl=1"},{"label":"Gameplay video","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-clEhswCl-Q"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgWe8J-iDsY"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/nae0jvhoixum64i/mpc.py"}],"ratings":[{"area":"audio","rank":106,"score":3.3},{"area":"theme","rank":153,"score":3.48},{"area":"graphics","rank":184,"score":3.43},{"area":"innovation","rank":253,"score":3.14},{"area":"overall","rank":417,"score":2.9},{"area":"mood","rank":461,"score":2.46},{"area":"fun","rank":541,"score":2.43},{"area":"coolness","rank":691,"score":42}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"My \"Game\", Stones and Lasers","category":"compo","description":"Please use the libraries :3.\nI will make an offline port soon, and it will work/be finished.\nThis is more of a broken demo, I hope to create the full thing within a couple more days.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/6cd914783b36a2df7326450fdba8bff7.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14911","author":{"name":"RawringPenguins","uid":14911,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/20338422ff84e90e825083f8b0e240b7?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/rawringpenguins/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14911-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14911-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/42031498/LudumDare24/bin/index.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/42031498/LudumDare24/LudumDare24.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1171,"score":0}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"NOAHS ARK 2","category":"compo","description":"WASD MOVES\nSPACEBAR TERRAFORMS","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/cf5edb5091e78510811ceda4bbed9676.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=10426","author":{"name":"racarate","uid":10426,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/beabcc93773e62291431d959d06fd1cc?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/racarate/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10426-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10426-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"win","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/r45w28vn2k4dfv1/NOAHSARK2.zip"},{"label":"osx","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7gg2wb3zouvsgv8/JKF7dzZh3s"},{"label":"love","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/z9zuro1vs741is4/NOAHSARK2.love"}],"ratings":[{"area":"audio","rank":376,"score":2.38},{"area":"graphics","rank":475,"score":2.62},{"area":"mood","rank":481,"score":2.42},{"area":"innovation","rank":570,"score":2.38},{"area":"theme","rank":655,"score":2},{"area":"overall","rank":677,"score":2.31},{"area":"fun","rank":719,"score":1.77},{"area":"coolness","rank":888,"score":30}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"On the Origin of Block","category":"jam","description":"On the Origin of Block\n\nsource is on git hub!\n\nOn the Origin of Block is a 2D platformer.\nYour goal is to mate blocks together to get the right shape to unlock doors and to reach the goal.

As you progress through the infinite amount of levels evolution gets progressively harder as the cells grow in size. Only forward thinking and luck will get you through to the next level of evolution.\n\nThe premise is straight forward, your cell randomly changes color and this color tells you the other cells you can pair with or need to avoid. You have limited health and time but must consume a growing number of matching cells to level up. Don't worry, you will have power ups like speed boost, or health refills to help you in your evolution. Be careful, one power up provides you the ability to evolve quickly but with it comes greater difficulty, you will see.\n\nCONTROLS:\n\nThe controls are simple, \"WASD\" or Left-Right-Up-Down will allow you to navigate between crowded cell filled areas or avoid unfriendly cells coming after you. Collect power ups and matching cells but avoid the other colored cells.

I'll probably upload an extended version on my website - mainly to clean the code, and add various elements I hadn't the time to include.\n\nFor the tools:\n- SFML (Graphics)\n- OpenAL (Sounds)\n- The Gimp (Art)\n- LMMS (Musics / Sounds)\n\nI hope you'll enjoy the game!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/50d27147953c53e7425577b91622d161.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=16516","author":{"name":"Mayto","uid":16516,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/31d088582bb8cdc819fc6fa98fa80630?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/mayto/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16516-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16516-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.curious-planet.com/files/crab.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://www.curious-planet.com/files/crab_linux.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.curious-planet.com/files/crab_src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":59},{"area":"audio","rank":3,"score":4.21},{"area":"mood","rank":7,"score":4.1},{"area":"graphics","rank":36,"score":4.17},{"area":"overall","rank":203,"score":3.3},{"area":"innovation","rank":320,"score":2.97},{"area":"fun","rank":515,"score":2.5},{"area":"humor","rank":600,"score":1.35},{"area":"theme","rank":625,"score":2.18}],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"EDR","category":"jam","description":"Unfortunately very unfinished the idea was to have it so your character would be able to modify his ability and evolve it untill you could pass the dungeon but such is life.\n\nControls are WSAD movement, up and down key to play with global lighting and right mouse button to kill stuff.\n\nIf nothing else I discovered a rather cool way to do lighting for my 2d game-stuffs so, not a total loss.\n\noh and L-key enables an EXTREMELY slow improved lighting mode that supports an infinite number of light sources per object so.. melt your pc or something! \n\nZip file includes literally everything, all the psd's including some unused ones, the GMK and other goodies.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/bdabc691d0f7996c9f5a2703c512ede5.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=12597","author":{"name":"Nightsjester","uid":12597,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5776ef12515fd3987604ed0bbd474ba5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/nightsjester/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12597-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12597-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12597-shot1.gif-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12597-shot1.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12597-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12597-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12597-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12597-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?cax1csi1tlxujrf"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1171,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Enhanced Man","category":"compo","description":"This is a classic, quite simple platformer where you use the arrow keys to move and jump.\n\nPress enter/esc/space to start the game when the first text is shown (forgot to add a message there ;) ) \n\nPick up different powerups to jump, run, and air-glide better.

Throughout the game houses will build on the tiles around your Town Center and continue to sprawl outwards, provided you are a good and loyal mayor. Each special building has different effects for the tiles around it. \nAs you play your city will either go bankrupt or go down in history as houses cover all areas of the map.  \n\nThe world that you build in is new every time which allows for different outcomes with each new play through. The best way to enjoy Urban Sprawl is to play more than once. Continue playing and notice new trends and more efficient ways of building your city. You are the mayor after all and can't just leave the citizens of Jarlsberg to suffer.\n\nUrban Sprawl is written in HTML5 and will play right in your browser. The game is even optimized for decent play on most tablets and smart phones so give it a shot if you own one.\n\nPlease let us know what you think of Urban Sprawl; we love to hear your comments and appreciate all feedback.

And if things get TOO hectic, use a PULSE WAVE to clear the screen.\n\nControls : Just press whatever keys you feel best represent a direction and ACTION setup, I got this...\n\nUpdates : I TOTALLY fixed that bug where the thing didn't work on Windows, and also a little bug with the particles on fast machines.\n\nThere was this one bug were the aliens were like \"Yo, we're going to spawn SUPER fast, like 2 fast 4 you, bro!\" and it's cause I'm all like \"TO THE MAX\" with my math.max() command, but I was supposed to be all math.min(). Now aliens won't be DOUCHEBAGS when you're being too AWESOME!\n\nApparently there's also a bug where everything goes \"Yeah, but NO, bro..\" and locks up like a deer in headlights.\nI think I TOTALLY fixed this. I messed with sound retriggering and got it to be COOL when SHOOT sounds were SPAMMED.\nIf it still decides it's going to be UNCOOL and locks up on you, let me know and I'll tell it who's BOSS!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/9e51169e4753b2b6c74714de85e74774.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=1561","author":{"name":"Gaeel","uid":1561,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5d4bc92bac982a01a6f062f4307c3305?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/gaeel/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1561-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1561-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Love 0.8","url":"http://www.thebinarychoice.com/ld24/gaeel/WTFAliens.love"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.thebinarychoice.com/ld24/gaeel/WTFAliens.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":61},{"area":"audio","rank":39,"score":3.66},{"area":"humor","rank":77,"score":3.22},{"area":"graphics","rank":103,"score":3.77},{"area":"innovation","rank":111,"score":3.53},{"area":"fun","rank":130,"score":3.33},{"area":"overall","rank":145,"score":3.42},{"area":"mood","rank":152,"score":3.1},{"area":"theme","rank":718,"score":1.67}],"platforms":["win","mac","linux","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"DANCE DANCE EVOLUTION","category":"jam","description":"wow!! dance dance evolution is a game about dancing and evolution that i'm making.\n\nit's not done yet, but it will be within the next few hours!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/3950c3868c9fe30ab2ec9c72a8fdd3e9.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14717","author":{"name":"tikky","uid":14717,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/21d330fa2688f6f808268dfe26583119?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/tikky/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14717-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14717-shot0.png"}],"links":[],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1171,"score":0}],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"E.V.o","category":"compo","description":"not completed\n\nVideo of timelapse and game.

There is also text in some levels, giving the minimum amount of info to play the game. But you really should go through the prologue. It's basically the whole story. Really. Please.\n\nControls:\nArrows/WAD    - move and jump\nSpace         - use Posi (when you have it)\nRight/D/Space - advance text\n\nTips:\n-You need to collide with the center of the portal to go to the next level.\n-If you don't land on top of the ground, you will pass through it\n-You can miss a platform by a few pixels and still 'pull yourself onto it'\n\n(All of these features are by design, not bugs)\nAnyway, thanks for playing.

You have to close it manually, either on the application settings, or calling the task switcher and swiping it away (Android 4+)\n* I lowered the quality of the images to around 60% on Androids to avoid memory issues, since I couldn't do a lot of debugging.

After you've played through a generation of block-organisms, you get to play through the descendants of the previous generation, created by a pseudo-Genetic-Algorithm/upgrade system.  \n\nYour upgrades/mutations will be visible on your blocky children.  Different mutations will benefit you in different ways, such as increasing speed, jump height, foraging range, swim speed, breath underwater, lifespan, and more.\n\n\nUPDATE: \n\nThe feedback I've been getting is pretty unanimous in that the game is unclear/too hard.  I can't fix that because of the 48 hour restriction obviously, but I will try to explain the things that are in the game.\n\nCONTROLS:\n\n- WASD to move\n- Space to jump\n- R to restart\n\nThe game is intentionally very hard at the beginning (though I think I overdid it).  You die quickly so that you can get to the next generations more quickly, and experience the evolving portion of the game faster.  Don't sweat it if you die a lot without getting any food; even if you only get food one or two times, you will still see upgrades in the next generation.  On the flip side if you think it's too difficult, it might be that the map generator handed you a really terrible map.  In this case refreshing/restarting may fix everything.\n\nThere are five types of terrain, and five types of food which correspond with them:\n\nJungle - Has dark green tiles that are impassable, and food runs away from you\nDesert - Has no obstacles, but has very scarce food\nOcean - Swimming slows you down, and you can run out of air\nCanyon - Has black tiles that you can fall into and die.  This is where jumping can be useful.\nMarsh - Slows your movement, and has invisible food that only comes into view as you get closer to it.\n\n\nIn later generations, your evolutionary progress shows in what look like food blocks that are on your block.  The benefits of these upgrades mirror the challenges of the respective terrain.\n\nJungle food - Makes you faster, so you can catch food that runs away\nDesert food - Increases lifespan substantially, and makes each food regenerate substantially more life\nOcean food - Makes you swim faster and gives you more air\nCanyon food - Increases jump height\nMarsh food - Marsh terrain slows you down less, and your search range for hidden food increases\n\nHope that helps somewhat.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/7bc235022b5fe55433fc60c938f3896e.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=15136","author":{"name":"Peltast","uid":15136,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1b351d1a248ec779577de490d630feed?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/peltast/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15136-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15136-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15136-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15136-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15136-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15136-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15136-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15136-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.peltastdesign.com/LD 24/Pure, I - LudumDare 24.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://peltastdesign.com/LD%2024/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://peltastdesign.com/LD 24/LD24src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":271,"score":3.15},{"area":"innovation","rank":288,"score":3.05},{"area":"coolness","rank":618,"score":46},{"area":"mood","rank":645,"score":1.93},{"area":"overall","rank":650,"score":2.38},{"area":"fun","rank":697,"score":1.9},{"area":"graphics","rank":735,"score":1.7}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"D'evilution","category":"compo","description":"Play as the nameless protagonist as he transitions from innocent child - to delusioned youth - to heartless killer!\n\nUse the ARROW keys to walk around the world.\n\nUse the SPACEBAR key to interact with others.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/082d9dab344c53118edab0283be8c211.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14703","author":{"name":"Joseph Labrecque","uid":14703,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cd6afaec31166bbdbc749a06ff85abd5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/josephlabrecque/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14703-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14703-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14703-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14703-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://josephlabrecque.com/ludumdare/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://josephlabrecque.com/ludumdare/EvolutionGame.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1171,"score":0}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Carcinogen Corp.","category":"jam","description":"STORYLINE\n\nOur character is a young boy, living with his parents in a small town on a small island.

I have tried to keep it a little different though, you have some gadgets...\n\nThe main gadget is a DNA-changing gun, and almost all of the things in the game can be turned into something else (platforms, barriers, powerups, creatures etc).  You can also teleport a short distance, which works well with changing enemies into platforms.  You have a normal gun too, so I tried to put stuff in that used both mechanics, like when you hit a miniature death-mouse with the DNA-gun, then it evolves into a giant spider. Bad right? BUT, if you shoot the crap out of a giant spider you get an ammo top-up, and there's loads of death-mice running about that you need to shoot the crap out of.  So that's what I was aiming for.\n\nOverall I'm really pleased with everything, except maybe that it didn't relate to the theme as much as I'd have liked.

(the supernova, planetary nebula and black hole are the nicest animations  IMO so its worth trying to get to them.)\n\nGUIDE(SPOILER):\n--------------\nA lot of people are missing some of the content so here is the guide on how to get each animation:\n\n1) Planet. collect as little of the dust as possible try to right click a region with few large particles without attracting anything. \n\n2) Protostar. attract for about at least 2 secs to collect some dust and right click.\n\nHow to win the Hydrogen fusing minigame: hold left click and fuse the ones which are close to each other first it might take a few tries but its not too hard once you got the hang of it.\n\n3) Brown dwarf. Lose the hydrogen fusing minigame.\n\n4) Sun -like star + Red giant win the hydrogen fusing minigame)\n\n5) Planetary Nebula + Whitedwarf. If you didn't collect too much dust in the first round (just more than enough to not get a planet) then after the red giant phase you will become a Planetary Nebula then a White Dwarf\n\n6) Supernova. if you collected a lot of dust in the first mini game ( collect for about 10-20 secs) then you get a Supernova after the red giant phase.\n\n7) After the supernova phase you get a strong force minigame where you must keep the proton and neutron apart (use two hands on the space bar alternating to click faster is what I find is the best way to beat this minigame). win it and you get a neutron star, lose it and you get a black hole.\n\nTo run it you may need:\n-Direct X9\n-Latest version of the .NET Framework\n-The XNA redistributable\n\nUse this image if you need a clue to get some of the achievements.\nhttp://www.astarmathsandphysics.com/a_level_physics_notes/cosmology/a_level_physics_notes_cosmology_template_html_42d1285.gif","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c42bcb24b6807be4f4de1a10318b80f5.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=15410","author":{"name":"Dadeyemi","uid":15410,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/06c34059a7d4744c95b0e5946c8250e2?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/dadeyemi/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15410-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15410-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15410-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15410-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15410-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15410-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15410-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15410-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15410-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15410-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/ifa20/Stellar%20Evolution.zip"},{"label":"XNA redist (required)","url":"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27598"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://youtu.be/-Q6xt0OH808"},{"label":"Playthough Video","url":"http://youtu.be/pt8s2o9NNWY"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/ifa20/Stellar%20Evolution%20Source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":57},{"area":"mood","rank":25,"score":3.79},{"area":"theme","rank":29,"score":4},{"area":"innovation","rank":67,"score":3.68},{"area":"graphics","rank":71,"score":3.93},{"area":"audio","rank":76,"score":3.41},{"area":"overall","rank":83,"score":3.61},{"area":"fun","rank":255,"score":3},{"area":"humor","rank":418,"score":1.94}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"The Evolution of Time","category":"compo","description":"Well, It's not finished, but I tried my best.

So I apologize for the hasty crap art and the lack of game balance.\n\nThe JAR is all uploaded now, and the applet is working. If you get poor performance in the applet I suggest downloading the JAR, but gameplay should be analogous on both. The source is included in the JAR if you unzip it.\n===================================\n\nYou are a renegade angel who has decided that man should have the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge in order to evolve from Homo Erectus to Homo Sapiens. The path to the fruit is fraught with dangers, however, and the lowly Homo Erectus are not strong enough to make it there alone. You must selectively breed the Homo Erectus until they are strong enough to fight off the feral creatures blocking the way to the apple.\n\nTO MOVE, LEFT CLICK ANYWHERE on screen. You will automatically path find. In addition, HOLD SPACE to lure Homo Erectus after you, RIGHT CLICK OR SHIFT-CLICK a Homo Erectus to tell it to go breed, and HOLD SHIFT OR S to bring up a stats display for each Homo Erectus.\n\nThe forbidden fruit is at the bottom right of the map. The monsters get stronger as you go, and you may also find different types of Homo Erectus along different side paths.\n\nTIPS:\nA good strategy really is to just select for fertility first, and then when you have very high fertility start selecting for attack and defense. The game is not terribly well balanced so you can pretty quickly get a small army that can win you the day. Also, I erred on the side of easy so it's very unlikely for a child to be worse than its parent in any way - if you keep breeding you're golden. I also implemented but later removed an inbreeding function (inbred creatures are much much worse) but I didn't have time to communicate this aspect at all so it's removed.\n\n========================\nWHAT THE STATS MEAN\n========================\npower - how much damage you do\ndefense - reduces the damage taken from enemies by this much\ndodge - the percent chance to completely avoid an attack (max is 75%)\nhitPoints - how much life you have\nfertility - how many offspring you can have (maximum). When 2 creatures mate, the amount of offspring is (parentA.fertility + parentB.fertility) / 2.\n\nSo in combat damage done to a defender is:\nattacker.power - defender.defense\nbut only if rand() > defender.dodge\n\n------------>Known issues:\n-Splash screen says go the bottom left.

when needed, you will control the leader of the escaping legion.\nIf you die still having Peanuts in the flock, another one will surely take the lead!!\n\n- You can roll (right arrow) to avoid falling objects.\n- Stall (left arrow ) to make sure some danger passes before you move on.\n- Jump and dash mid air (up + right arrows) to make your way through big gaps or higher obstacles.\n- Throw a peanut ( space bar ) from the flock, knowing full well he's sacrificing himself for the group's sake.\nNot implemented \n-- throw peanuts to free other peanuts caught in inprisionment and add them to your group!\n-- throw peanuts to take down obstacles and clear a path for the group.\n\n\nSo we planned for 5 levels and ended up with a flawed mere one hehe, still the base gameplay is mostly there, with some hard edges to polish but, in our opinion, pretty fun to experiment.\nAltough the collisions still need some work.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the little preview as much as we enjoyed making it

To have an easier beggining press the sun in the menu to get +2000 life essence on the start. Then make surve to evolve into a fish, as it makes the game more easy, although the regeneration rate at the same beggining gonna be a little slow.\n\nTo gather life essence swim into an enemy organism that looks weaker than you. Then you'll notice damage turn's info popping out about how much damage you and your enemy dealed. If the enemy damage looks higher it's probably wiser to try to avoid him for some time.\n\nYou can avoid some of the damage by quickly attacking some enemies at once. Damage turn restarts every 0.5 second on every creature, this means that after getting hit you can still hit another creature without you getting harmed.\n\nAfter the evolution the best way is to upgrade damage one time first, as your base damage is pretty low. Then the best pick would be to upgrade life and armor. The size upgrade is giving you the most advantage later on for a really low price of 100LE each, and it helps out a lot in hitting multiple organism at once, thus lowering your total damage that you receive.\n\n#####Handbook:#####\n\nUpgrades:\n\nSpeed        - Max spd +20, costs 100LE +25LE per spd level.\n\nAcceleration - Max acc +20, max spd +5, costs 100LE +25LE per acc level.\n\nArmor        - Max arm +1, max life +5, armor regen +0.01, costs 125LE + 25LE per armor level.\n\nDanger       - Level +2, power* +10, leadership** +1, costs 200LE + 50LE per dng level.\n\nDamage       - Power +20, costs 150LE + 25LE per dmg level.\n\nSize         - Size + 2.25% base size, max life +5, power +2, costs 100LE.\n\nLife         - Max life+20, life regen +0.2, costs 150LE + 25LE per life level.\n\nForm         - gives you a new form. Costs 2000LE + 4000LE per form level.\n\nEnemies:\nCell - +5LE \nPlankton - +12LE\nFish - +30LE\n\n* - raises the damage output.\n** - currently not implemented\n\nWindows bugfix allows you to resize the window. It doesn't change the gameplay, nor the design. Also it's not required to play.\n\nHave fun in conquering the depths!\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/843af1a59f17187897e2c3ed96091453.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14379","author":{"name":"Griz","uid":14379,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ee5c4e909a9cf2ca55ab85c8826d759f?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/griz/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14379-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14379-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14379-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14379-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows Post compo","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/pnshbwd1n3zu4v9/The%20Life%20Tale%20v1_1.7z?dl=0"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/q1dikq3z8lvzjh8/The%20Life%20Tale%20LD24.zip"},{"label":"Win fix(not really needed)","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hbfjsdnou6licrw/The%20Life%20Tale%20fix.exe"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFBRPmoBrn4"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/vq2u8vlvimdry36/The%20Life%20Tale%20LD24%20Source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"theme","rank":196,"score":3.37},{"area":"audio","rank":221,"score":2.83},{"area":"mood","rank":328,"score":2.71},{"area":"innovation","rank":356,"score":2.88},{"area":"humor","rank":460,"score":1.84},{"area":"graphics","rank":461,"score":2.65},{"area":"overall","rank":482,"score":2.76},{"area":"fun","rank":553,"score":2.4}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"The Underglen","category":"jam","description":"- left/right arrow keys control your movement\n- spacebar to jump, hold it down and release to go higher\n- e to interact with the environment (seaweed)\n* there is no goal *","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a7614833a2723b17880668464f11b4c7.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=3652","author":{"name":"Derek Brown","uid":3652,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/896e251c31d9f1a1c3529a248049406c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/fingerfactor/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/3652-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/3652-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.swfup.com/swf/avsv.swf"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1112,"score":10}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Total argument","category":"jam","description":"WARNING: Loading can be LONG!\n\nWE RECOMMEND: Playing in Chrome/Chromium because it provides the best performance.\n\nIt is war.

The code is somewhat messy because I started panicking when time was running out.\n\nWhy I made this:\nI was thinking about a game where it would be a top down robot shooter where you character would evolve into something bigger and has more guns. Then I decided you should maybe be in space flying from planet to planet getting things to prepare for a big planet where you get a device that basically lets you evolve into a dog and then it shows you 3 years before saying \"I wanna be a dog\" - the end\n\nBut I realized it was stupid and I would've run out of time anyway. So I tried making a city building game where your city evolves as you defend it. There was supposed to be bosses and different enemy types and they would attack in waves but I ran out of time. You will find the extra images in the source. I also tried making workers go from place to place doing the jobs as enemies killed them with you defending. But I didn't have time to fix the bugs. There supposed to be a larger map too. Try imagining what it should've been like and then go play it and realize how bad it is. I may make a post compo version.\n\nCONTROLS:\nControl - switch between fire and build mode\nClick - Place building/Shoot\nW/S forward and backward\nA/D turn robot when in build mode (in fire mode it follows your cursor)\n\nOther instructions:\nShoot the other robots.\nThere are three building types:\nMiner - gets stone to make more mines houses and farms\nFarm - makes food\nHouse - (you only need one of these, but you must have at least one) makes workers for every 5 food\nThe only purpose of buildings is to increase score.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/46a3362412b4d4db5034f13824b42964.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=11270","author":{"name":"ahm99","uid":11270,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/eb68fc18783274932c2e539ea7084d16?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/ahm99/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11270-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11270-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Bugfixed Web Version","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/72946089/robot.html"},{"label":"Original Download","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/72946089/RobotCity.jar"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/72946089/Source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"audio","rank":562,"score":1.57},{"area":"humor","rank":586,"score":1.42},{"area":"mood","rank":684,"score":1.46},{"area":"theme","rank":698,"score":1.81},{"area":"graphics","rank":710,"score":1.88},{"area":"innovation","rank":723,"score":1.88},{"area":"overall","rank":743,"score":1.94},{"area":"fun","rank":744,"score":1.56},{"area":"coolness","rank":791,"score":36}],"platforms":["web","desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Scavenger","category":"jam","description":"A 2D top-down physics-based space game.\n\nVERY broken right now, plus a little bit unfinished.\nIt's not as unfinished as it looks.

A robot that collects and imitates lifeforms, a \"soul jar\" from space, crash lands and must return to his ship.  Along the way you teach it how to behave and depending how you influence and evolve his AI will result in several different endings.\n\nHis AI will develop based on your actions, as he learns from you.  If you become aggressive shooting your way through the enemies the robot will take on aggressive traits, eventually even targeting you, if you heal, carry and protect him he will learn to protect you also, if you are greedy and consume all the food and liquids and items he will adopt those traits also.  There are lots of possibilities with how he acts though I kind of ran out of time as the list is still largely unimplemented.

One is Flash, the other a standalone .exe for Windows. The reason for this is that the Flash version requires a pretty competent processor. I made the game on a dual-core desktop, and the Flash version lags HORRIBLY on it (it's okay on my i3 laptop, though). \n\nSo if the Flash version is laggy for you, PLEASE play the standalone version instead. It is NOT fair to rate something you can't run properly, after all. Thank you.\n\nSECONDLY, if you're the kind of person who cares, despite being hosted there, the Flash version isn't eligible for the Kongregate competition, due to lack of integrated API. I know some people got a bit tetchy about playing Kong games since that whole 'thing' happened, so I dunno, this information might be useful.\n\nFINALLY! This game has fully voice-acted cutscenes that tell the story that is basically integral to the whole thing. They ARE skippable (via the 'Escape' key), but I'd really appreciate it if you'd watch them - You're judging, after all, and how can you judge content you've skipped?\n\nRIGHT!\n\nNOW ON TO THE GAME!\n\nYou are Fred, a small, philosophical pink thing, doing the bidding of an ominous disembodied voice from above.\n\nCollect the green food things to add 10 points to your score, but be quick, because your score is dropping every second. \n\nTry and avoid getting hit. Every hit you take will cost you a whopping TWENTY points, which is a lot. And now you're thinking \"Wait, I CAN;T DIE?! Ahahaha! Where's the challenge in this?\" Well, bub, the 'challenge' is in getting a high score. FOR A REASON.\n\nThere's a 'true' ending to the INCREDIBLY WELL-WRITTEN, VOICE-ACTED NARRATIVE that you'll only get to see if you can score more than 700 points overall. So y'know, put some effort in.\n\nMove with WASD, aim/shoot when you're able to with the mouse (hold the left button down to shoot continuously), skip cutscenes with 'Escape' but, like I said, please don't.\n\nThat's everything, I think. If you encounter any bugs, grab me on Twitter (@dedhedzed) and I'll try and get them fixed as fast as I can. \n\nPhew!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/acc071628a1e4dc6f582ffb735e9f094.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=4687","author":{"name":"Zed","uid":4687,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7a330b74d4d203866a7c9b449ef15736?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/dedhedzed/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4687-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4687-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4687-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4687-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4687-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4687-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4687-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4687-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4687-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/4687-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.kongregate.com/games/DedHedZed/the-neon-pink-philosophy"},{"label":"Windows (Standalone - NO installer!)","url":"http://gamejolt.com/freeware/games/arcade/the-neon-pink-philosophy/9353/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/15995948/NeonPhilosophySource.rar"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"humor","rank":5,"score":4.19},{"area":"audio","rank":14,"score":3.97},{"area":"fun","rank":23,"score":3.82},{"area":"overall","rank":28,"score":3.85},{"area":"mood","rank":46,"score":3.64},{"area":"theme","rank":114,"score":3.6},{"area":"graphics","rank":150,"score":3.55},{"area":"innovation","rank":442,"score":2.68}],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Ascension: The Way","category":"compo","description":"Join an angel on his path to ascension.

You would choose certain evolutions at points during that game that would give you new abilities (Invisibility, poison, ect.) and then you'd carry on until you died and got a highscore (How many heroes you killed).\n\nWhat it is:\nRight now it's a simple little game where you run around a one floor dungeon (Ladders don't work yet), opening doors and running away from an angry looking head. The dungeon works, the line of sight works, simple AI works, death works, and so does some other stuff. Oh and the dungeon is randomly generated (That took me the first 12 hours :D).\n\nWhat it isn't:\nA lot.

LWJGL needs to be added to the java \nlibrary path to run, examples of this are in the Play*.sh files.\n\nEnjoy and rate lots of games, also kittens.\n\n@adventureloop\n\nadventurist.me \n\n\nPostmortem\nhttp://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/08/31/ludum-dare-24-postmortem/","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/fe216cccd0770a60d0a405c2c14bcdce.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=6827","author":{"name":"adventureloop","uid":6827,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5440baa168161b1f3240c5c952479284?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/adventureloop/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/6827-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/6827-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/6827-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/6827-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/6827-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/6827-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"ALL","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/24871892/Adventureloop-LD24-Literally.Earth.Shaping.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/24871892/Adventureloop-LD24-Literally.Earth.Shaping-Source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":248,"score":3.22},{"area":"graphics","rank":447,"score":2.68},{"area":"innovation","rank":447,"score":2.67},{"area":"audio","rank":513,"score":1.94},{"area":"coolness","rank":570,"score":49},{"area":"mood","rank":658,"score":1.86},{"area":"overall","rank":713,"score":2.16},{"area":"fun","rank":758,"score":1.33}],"platforms":["java","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Many Mans and the Mutant Clones from Space","category":"compo","description":"Evolution?

Located on the human brain, she is thinking about looking for a new body (yes, this cell can control bodies), because she finds the human body not good enough for her.\n\nSo she jumps off the human, and accidentally gets on a rat. For her, controlling a rat is horrible, so she begins running and searching a new body.\n\nAfter one level, she finds a dog. She continues to search a better body, though.\n\nI ran out of time, so the game only includes 4 (big) levels. I will provide a link to a version with more levels soon.\n\nThis is my first LD and it was a very, very great experience (very hard too, as this game is my second C++ game on PC).\n\nYou can find my post-mortem here: http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/08/28/egocell-post-mortem/\n\nI streamed on http://twitch.tv/adbook/ if you want to see the records.\nNow, let me sleep for three days, please !\n\n\n\nNote that the game is not complete.\n\n\nEDIT: I noticed a huge flaw in the way the collisions were performing: if the player falls from too high or comes in a platform the wrong way, It would occasionate a buffer overflow and eventually a SEGFAULT (wich would cause a crash...). The same with the screens between each level. I fixed these two flaws, and by some board effect, the player's jump became stable (so the bug was due to some wrong collision detection), as did the mobs jumps. I uploaded the fixed version to avoid SEGFAULTS and memory leaks !","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/f80e75d040ddd9313fc80b461c3f6d9c.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=15476","author":{"name":"Adbook","uid":15476,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e4ada31026d37c7762e8ae32d8e99b0a?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/adbook/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15476-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15476-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15476-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15476-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15476-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15476-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://adbook.tk/ludumdare24/egocell_win.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://adbook.tk/ludumdare24/egocell.tar.gz"},{"label":"TimeLapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmLIPEU77E0&feature=youtu.be"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"humor","rank":121,"score":2.34},{"area":"theme","rank":145,"score":2.71},{"area":"fun","rank":166,"score":2.67},{"area":"audio","rank":179,"score":2.2},{"area":"overall","rank":179,"score":2.78},{"area":"mood","rank":185,"score":2.41},{"area":"graphics","rank":191,"score":2.67},{"area":"innovation","rank":213,"score":2.26}],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Evil Tests","category":"jam","description":"*DOWNLOAD WORKS AGAIN!*\n\nIn this game, you are being tested by evil people and levels evolve as you complete them.\n\nThe game might be a bit buggy, we ran short on time, please report any bugs at https://github.com/raoz/Ludum-Dare-24/issues\nWe are going to make a post-compo version with more blocks, less bugs, more levels and a level editor!\n\nHow to play:\nWASD to move, Space to jump.

It's an unfinished piece of sh*t, it's not worth your time.\n\nBasically, I tried to make a game as a sort of simulator/strategy/sandbox thing with the main goal of evolving life on a planet and then developing it's technology. Every evolvement process (both technological and organic) is scripted and the gameplay consists of influencing the process in some way. \n\nIn the end, I failed and managed to finish only evolutionary process, meaning I've scrapped technological advancement part and conflicts between different species. I've also left behind some more stuff from original concept, such as life transfer between planets.\n\nThe version you see here is shameful to call an alpha even. It's unfinished and there's actually no reason for uploading it here. There's a slight consolation in this being my first actual game project and a game jam, also my first *real* experience with Unity besides testing. I guess it's something.\n\nI will try to finish this in the following days so that the game will be more of a \"game\" rather than a test.\n\nNote: There are other types of planets with other basic conditions in game code, including gas giants and ocean planets. I will add random planet generation in forthcoming updates so that they will be available too.\n\nEDIT 1: Added web version, added 28.8_Data folder to windows build.\nEDIT 2: Fixed some bugs, added a note about game's state, working status messages. Since contest rules permit only small fixes, this version is a 'final' contest one (unless there will be bugs, which I'll fix). Any new updates will be linked as \"(latest)\" in download section, with changelog info here.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d29d721f66233d5882ff5701dfb8a745.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=15409","author":{"name":"Pro_Ice","uid":15409,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9098e2b46a7af7ba0937ca8e07b6cf48?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/pro_ice/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15409-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15409-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/21500584/LD24/28.8-2.rar"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://utkonosinteractiv.narod.ru/LD24_web/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1080,"score":14}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Meow for MUTATION!","category":"compo","description":"Story:\nAn intelligent race of feline-like creatures has just learned about the upcoming attack of ALIENS.

Hot air and cold air makes you get higher and lower, which lets you gain speed, lose water or lose speed, gain water.\n\nThe white arrows manually adjust your course through the map. The blue and red arrows throughout the map are supposed to change your course and height.\n\nIt takes a careful balance between water and speed to make a good hurricane. If you get too low to the ground, you'll gain too much water and crash into the water (aka break the game). Go too high, and you'll be ZOOMING FAST, but you won't have any water.\n\nHTML5 version coming soon.\n\nCredits:\nLead Designer - Mitch Orcino\nProgrammer/Designer - Kyle Bradshaw - @TehSkull\nArtist - Dae in Cho - @Haloflooder\nMusician - Seth White - @HerbivoreZombie","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d6aff268885bf04b165613a0a830394f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=13948","author":{"name":"TehSkull","uid":13948,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c7bd03399d670505a359b604ecd3a0ca?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/tehskull/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13948-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13948-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Android","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/29856467/Betas/The%20Winding%20of%20Isaac.apk"},{"label":"MP3","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/29856467/Cat5.mp3"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/29856467/main.lua"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":141,"score":2.77},{"area":"graphics","rank":215,"score":2.46},{"area":"theme","rank":225,"score":2},{"area":"overall","rank":257,"score":2.08},{"area":"fun","rank":266,"score":1.69},{"area":"coolness","rank":691,"score":42}],"platforms":["mobile","web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"3 Little Pigs","category":"compo","description":"----------------------------------\nThis is a short 3D game where you play as Big Bad Wolf to reclaim your lunch ham.\nGameplay is extremely simple and based on bringing the pig's houses down.\n----------------------------------\n\n-------- How to Play --------\nUse WASD or arrows keys to move and Space to jump.\nEat the pig to pass the level.

To start, click on the flickering energy node to expand your network, this costs 25 energy points. The game will generate a portion of the network that's powered by that energy node (which will now look like a glowing orb).\n\nThe white enemies are attracted to these energy nodes and will immediately move towards them. If an energy node runs out of health points (indicated by the orb shrinking) it and the entire portion of the network that it powers will disappear forever.\n\nTo protect these nodes, click on a hardpoint (a dark circle) which are spawned in various places along the network. This will create a defense turret (costing 5 energy points) which will target enemies and shoot them down. Turrets can also be relocated to another empty hardpoint, useful when a portion of the network is about to go down, you can save the turrets by moving them.\n\nYou can press \"Space\" to reset the game, and you can \"Right Click\" and drag to pan the camera around.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/bdaec7f637992e41ebfde32c2b77bce7.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=16474","author":{"name":"Chimera","uid":16474,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2680e303526101d5bdf3ffe5b2c7ffd7?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/chimera/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16474-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16474-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16474-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16474-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.solidfiles.com/d/33a8e34ece/"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://ld24.zzl.org/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.solidfiles.com/d/68adb54b16/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":29,"score":3.9},{"area":"mood","rank":119,"score":3.2},{"area":"graphics","rank":190,"score":3.41},{"area":"overall","rank":233,"score":3.22},{"area":"theme","rank":294,"score":3.1},{"area":"fun","rank":330,"score":2.86},{"area":"coolness","rank":618,"score":46}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Evolution Jumper","category":"jam","description":"Build your own DNA from fragments to gain and lose attributes and progress through this short game.\nIMPORTANT: Press TAB to open/close the DNA screen.

The only thing you don't get to see is the death screen!\n\n\nEDIT: Many congratulations to Ditto, the first winner of Revolvolution! A few others have won too; can you manage it?\n\nNotes:\nSuitable for Leftys: Both Left-Mouse-Button and Right-Mouse-Button work for shooting.\nWorks with both QWERTY and AZERTY keyboards: Use either ZQSD or WASD to move the player. Is your keyboard not supported? Message me so I can keep that in mind for next time, and just use the arrow-keys.\n\nHere it is, 48 hours later. My entry to Ludum Dare 24, my first Ludum. Revolvolution is a top-down shooter where as the player progresses they receive worse and worse weapons, until they're left with a spoon.\n\n'Evolution' was tough as a theme. But right from the very start, I decided not to go for the obvious cell manipulation. I instead took a twist on the theme and went for 'Devolution', something getting worse over time instead of better (which 'Evolution' can also apply to, if your of the pedantic persuasion). \n\nYou play as Scotty, an old biker still in his helmet. He is being attacked by a rival biker gang (also in their helmets, which match Scotty's. I'm lazy, okay?). However, as he defends himself, the items he's using against his foes overheat, jam, break, or slip out of his sweaty paw. So, he grabs the next most useful thing to fight on. \n\nThere are 3 levels, each with about 12 enemies each. However, once you defeat the enemies in a level, you repeat the level with an inferior weapon. The weapons are, in order  of aqcuisition (with poor humour included): Minigun, Flamethrower, Shotgun, Ass-ault Rifle, Badass Dual Pistols, Revolvolution (Revolver), Smackerel (Mackerel to smack with) and Spoony the Spoon (a spoon).\n\nBecause your weapons get weaker, the game gets harder. It also provides the unique opportunity to take down an enemy with a minigun using only a spoon.\n\nThe levels themselves also get progressively harder, with more, and stronger, enemies spawned.\n\nThe controls (also listed on the menu screen) are arrow keys to move (or WASD for QWERTY folk and ZQSD for AZERTY peoples), mouse to aim, and then left mouse button or right mouse button to shoot. But not the scroll-wheel. My mother thought it was the scroll wheel for some reason...\n\nSo, enjoy Revolvolution! If you manage to win, make sure to post a screenie of the victory screen!\n\nAlso, about the source: The files are in the .pde format, as the game is made in Processing (www.processing.org). You will need to download Processing to make use of them (it's just a Java lib-type-thing). Or, you might be able to open them in a text editor...\n\nBut anyway, enjoy!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/9c41c27157fa2d5cc1f3d5d88aa1a2e1.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=13363","author":{"name":"iandioch","uid":13363,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/310209d3adfd14d794f09541a1234db5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/iandioch/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13363-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13363-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13363-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13363-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13363-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13363-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13363-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13363-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13363-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13363-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web Applet, JAR, and Webstart","url":"http://www.staticvoidgames.com/play/?game=Revolvolution"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.cx.com/mycx/share/bLHxWu-3EeGo2RICOA-R7w/Revolvolution.windows32.zip"},{"label":"Mac OSX","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?gt8g21ode2ldqp7"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://www.cx.com/mycx/share/LpgdXO-3EeG6whICOBql1A/Revolvolution.linux32.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://www.cx.com/mycx/share/Do61Wu-4EeG6whICOBql1A/RevolvolutionSrc.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":53},{"area":"fun","rank":121,"score":3.36},{"area":"overall","rank":211,"score":3.29},{"area":"mood","rank":249,"score":2.88},{"area":"humor","rank":311,"score":2.23},{"area":"graphics","rank":372,"score":2.93},{"area":"innovation","rank":447,"score":2.67},{"area":"theme","rank":622,"score":2.21}],"platforms":["web","java","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Planet Evo","category":"jam","description":"Actually it was idea for compo.\nRight now it super simplified. \nWhat you can play was build in 4 hours on Monday, after everything that was done on Friday and Saturday was trashed.\n(I totally give up on Sunday)\n\nThanks, for moral support for guys from my company who was doing the LD24, too.\n\nIt's my first try of Starling framework.

If the music is still going, it's not actually stuck, just loading the level. I should have made that more clear in the text on the page. Wait for up to 30 seconds. The loading process is sadly very slow.\n\nI'd appreciate it if any comments also included how easily you drew the link to the theme, or if you even found a link between the two. I'm especially interested in hearing if you thought the theme was subtly introduced or very obviously.\n\nThe game has no sounds, except for the music track. There appears to be a bug with the music making it so it might not start up properly on non-Windows OSes.\n\nKeys:\n\nArrow keys - movement.\nEscape - quit.\nM - mute music.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c9142ade222929ffbaed220ac5958100.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14718","author":{"name":"Red Mike","uid":14718,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f2ee31373b0bafccc33548db4a5f42db?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/red-mike/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14718-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14718-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14718-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14718-shot1.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://codingden.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/acoa-ld24-py2exe-win.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://codingden.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/acoa-ld24-source.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://codingden.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/acoa-ld24-source.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://codingden.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/acoa-ld24-source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"mood","rank":42,"score":3.67},{"area":"theme","rank":271,"score":3.15},{"area":"graphics","rank":282,"score":3.15},{"area":"innovation","rank":406,"score":2.77},{"area":"overall","rank":531,"score":2.69},{"area":"fun","rank":653,"score":2.08},{"area":"coolness","rank":904,"score":28}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Barnacles","category":"compo","description":"In \"Barnacles\" you are a predator fish.

The longest time spent was on the genetic algorithm code used to breed the dragons and craft the towers between each wave.\n\nThe only thing left on my todo list, was to give the dragons some basic animation, and then a few more tower attributes such as a damage over time or sticky shots.\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/44a3b976b3ccca0d0ec4fa42163bf522.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14989","author":{"name":"golex","uid":14989,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/caab22408b305d31e87129e49f8fd122?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/golex/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14989-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14989-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14989-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14989-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14989-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14989-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14989-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14989-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14989-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14989-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://ryanaustin.net/ld24/MutatingScales_Win.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://ryanaustin.net/ld24/MutatingScales.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://ryanaustin.net/ld24/MutatingScales_Src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":4,"score":4.41},{"area":"overall","rank":87,"score":3.59},{"area":"fun","rank":163,"score":3.23},{"area":"innovation","rank":187,"score":3.27},{"area":"audio","rank":250,"score":2.76},{"area":"humor","rank":259,"score":2.41},{"area":"mood","rank":320,"score":2.72},{"area":"graphics","rank":382,"score":2.91},{"area":"coolness","rank":667,"score":44}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Survival of the Fitterest","category":"compo","description":"This game is about survival of the fittest and natural selection.

Unity 4 will add Linux support.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/38bbc20aecf896b943442ace814e5e74.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14456","author":{"name":"Desi Quintans","uid":14456,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0cdc97d9cf011f522c38c4e655d86839?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/desiquintans/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14456-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14456-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14456-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14456-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14456-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14456-shot2.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14456-shot3.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14456-shot3.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14456-shot4.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14456-shot4.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Play in Browser","url":"http://cowfacegames.com/ld24/additive.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://cowfacegames.com/file_download/4/Additive+-+Unity+Source.zip"},{"label":"Time Lapses","url":"http://cowfacegames.com/games/additive"},{"label":"Post-Mortem","url":"http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/09/05/additive-post-mortem-spoiler-i-had-fun/"},{"label":"Pages from my notebook","url":"http://cowfacegames.com/games/additive"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":91},{"area":"audio","rank":44,"score":3.63},{"area":"innovation","rank":55,"score":3.75},{"area":"overall","rank":67,"score":3.65},{"area":"fun","rank":91,"score":3.47},{"area":"mood","rank":112,"score":3.22},{"area":"graphics","rank":332,"score":3.04},{"area":"humor","rank":333,"score":2.15},{"area":"theme","rank":583,"score":2.34}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Adversity","category":"jam","description":"UPDATE: Windows executable uploaded!\n\nWelcome to ADVERSITY\nYou begin with 20 organisms.\nOver time, they eat, reproduce, flee predators, and deal with environmental hazards\nEvery so often, they have to face Adversity.\nThat's where you come in...\n\n\nThis is a console interface 'game' where you have only indirect control over the evolution of your organisms.

Unfortunately, since this is the weekend before university starts for me, I didn't have time to finish it. Using a language that I didn't have prior experience in (Haxe) didn't make things easier either. Unfinished also means that only about 10 enemies will spawn throughout the game (This may or may not be because spawning an enemy with a distinct movement pattern requires 5+ lines of code to set up the bezier curve...)\n\nDespite being unfinished and very buggy (especially when it comes to collision and sprites) I decided to submit it anyway.\n\nI used SFXR to create the sound effects and Autotracker-Bu to generate the music track.\n\n--------------------------\n\nAssimilation is a vertical scrolling shooter (Though no scrolling has been added yet...) with a twist. In order to power up your ship, you must absorb powers from enemies using special \"assimilators\" that you fire.\n\nIn this unfinished version, there are three kinds of powers:\n* Assimilation (Enables you to fire assimilators, default power.)\n* Shield (You can put up a temporary shield around your ship. Note that this is pretty unreliable due to bugs...)\n* Bombs (Your ship can fire bombs which explode upon colliding with an enemy, damaging everthing inside a specific radius)\n\nIf you assimilate the same enemy more than once, the associated power will level up, increasing its effectiveness. For example, bombs will have a larger radius and shields will last longer.\n\nControls:\nMove your ship with the mouse cursor.\nPress the left mouse button to shoot, hold to fire repeatedly.\nPress X to use the currently selected power.\nScrolling up or down changes the current power.\n\n(NOTE: Since I was forced to stop the coding process abruptly, I didn't have time to set up a fancy page for the SWF. I therefore decided to add it as an ordinary download link as well, since the web version doesn't show loading progress.)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/efbf0f9a816dcad7dea99db393a9ac1c.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14643","author":{"name":"Merigrim","uid":14643,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3f83149119ed830f0c14a7e5b5a060c6?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/merigrim/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14643-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14643-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14643-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14643-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://sites.google.com/site/abstracthelicoid/Evolution.swf?attredirects=0"},{"label":"SWF

In practice this may not turn out so well as many supporting features were not completed in time and there is unlikely to be a large enough layer base.\n\nControls\n--------\n* Left mouse: place/remove wire or paste selection\n* Right mouse: select/cut area\n* Ctrl+Left mouse: Cycle wire/electron head/electron tail\n* L: load last opponent's circuit\n* Ctrl+z: undo last change to circuit\n* Space: begin battle\n\nInputs\n------\nOn the left of the circuit are three inputs - three different distance sensors that insert electrons when the robots are a given distance apart (as a percentage of the arena width).\n\nOutputs\n-------\nThere are five outputs on the right hand side of the circuit  that are continuously activated by receiving at least one electron every eight steps - three weapons and two movement controls. The three weapons are the Laser (which does the least damage), the Rocket (which also damages you if the opponent is too close) and the Claw (which can only attack at close range). If two weapons are active at the same time, each deals one half of its usual damage (one third if three are active). The remaining two outputs move your robot forward and back (for your robot, left and right on the battle display respectively).\n\nBattle display\n--------------\nThe number in the top right represents your health and the top left your opponent's. The two boxes in the middle represent the relative spacing of the robots.\n\n\nIf you are on windows you can run the windows executable version. Otherwise (on OS/X, Linux or Windows) you need love2d (https://love2d.org/) to run the love file.\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/82467e853a8dbbaac6bc94174269a936.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=7674","author":{"name":"Finn Stokes","uid":7674,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7f76e6a76415b88a29d43d9a102ca6f2?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/finn/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7674-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7674-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Linux & OS/X (Love)","url":"https://github.com/downloads/FinnStokes/rbf/rbf.love"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/downloads/FinnStokes/rbf/rbf_windows_0.1.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/FinnStokes/rbf"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":66},{"area":"innovation","rank":3,"score":4.26},{"area":"fun","rank":173,"score":3.2},{"area":"overall","rank":187,"score":3.34},{"area":"theme","rank":209,"score":3.32},{"area":"mood","rank":409,"score":2.56},{"area":"humor","rank":488,"score":1.77},{"area":"graphics","rank":600,"score":2.29}],"platforms":["linux","desktop","mac","win"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Two Tribes","category":"jam","description":"Less of a game and more of a sandbox toy.

The dot will move ahead (from the middle of the area straight up) and you can control the following:\n- \"Turn At\": If you set it to X, it will turn in every Xth turn, by the amount specified in \"Turn Amount\". Turning happens before spawning. \n- \"Turn Amount\": The degree of turning. Zero degree is continuing in a straight line, negative amounts are turning to the left (-1..-179, -90 is the square angle.) Positive amounts will turn the dot to the right, 90 again is the square angle, 180 is turning back. \n- \"Spawn At\": Setting it to Y, in every Yth turn a new dot is generated at the same position, but turned by the \"Child Dir Offset\" amount. \n- \"Child Dir Offset\": New dot's will be turned by this amount relative to the current direction of their parent. The valid values are the same as for \"Turn Amount\". This affects only the direction, not the location.\nExample: When spawning, your dot has a direction of -90 (going straight to the left). The CDO is set to 100. Your new dot will inherit the -90, then the 100 is added, so the new dot will have a direction of +10, which is a bit to the right from straight up. \n- \"Die At\": Dots will die after living for this much turns. Spawning happens before dieing. New dots start with age=0.\n\nIn Challenge Mode, you need to match your rule to the randomly generated one. The information message above the canvases will tell you how many of the five are currently matched. Tip: Before doing challenges, experiment with the values, so that you have a general understanding of the effects caused by changing a parameter. Start with simple turning first, then play with the \"Die At value\", then with the Spawing and CDO. \n\nIn Freeform mode, all you need to do is to experiment with different rules. I hope you will share any interesting rules with us in the comments, should you find one. :D\n\nEnjoy!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/70e420b57ee7fd675c6637a42308491c.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=16505","author":{"name":"VagabondEx","uid":16505,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/537c4a980415e34050875c515615d0a4?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/vagabondex/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16505-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16505-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://e-volve.appspot.com/"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://e-volve.appspot.com/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":86,"score":3.59},{"area":"theme","rank":561,"score":2.41},{"area":"overall","rank":647,"score":2.39},{"area":"fun","rank":662,"score":2.06},{"area":"graphics","rank":685,"score":2},{"area":"coolness","rank":832,"score":33}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Evoluball","category":"compo","description":"Evoluball is a small game where you transform the ball you control as you gain points.

Also, with every new generation of bunnies, mutations are possible, so over time the population can get faster, gain better eyesight (for avoiding your bombs), or tougher.\n\nControls\nBombs place themselves automatically several times a second, so keep your mouse cursor moving to where you want an explosion to occur. The bomb will go off in 2.5 seconds, damaging or killing bunnies in its blast radius.\n\nConfession\nThis game represents the result of many concessions that ultimately had to be made as a result of a very, very busy weekend that left with me with only about half a day of actual programming time. As such, I must apologize if the game is poorly balanced or rather shallow.

However, since I didn't make enough levels in time to do that (or write a story, or make anything but the most barebones art and the most barebones platforming mechanics because I spent most of my time getting the text thing to work), I just have it so the graphics upgrade every time you die on the graphical level, you can at least get an idea of what it would look like.\n\nDespite its degree of unfinished-ness, I submitted it anyway, because at least it's playable and somewhat challenging, and I'd hate to see all that work go to waste (after all, I did write a text-based platforming engine from scratch in 48 hours, and I think that's something to be proud of).  Originally, the game was going to be played on this very ratings page (the text would've transformed into a game window from whatever link you clicked on to start the game), but unfortunately, the submission form didn't allow me to do the Javascript shenanigans I needed for that to happen.

Programming was done by Joseph Thomson and art was done Robert Thomson.\n\nPre-compo synopsis:\n\nYou spawn on the inside of a circle, headless, and all you seem to be able to do is run. You run around the inside of the circle, and then you see something fading into existance as you reach 1 full revolution. It's a mask! A very poorly made mask but a mask nonetheless, you put it on and when you channel your energy through it, a knife appears! floating and disembodied, how useful! especially since an enemy seems to have just spawned! headless, and what you think looked like an 'R', but it faded. You put your knife to work on the poor guy and you are alone once more. You run around a bit and as you reach another revolution you see, yes! another mask! You decide that this one looks noteably nicer, so you put it on and channel your energy through it again. A sword appears! and around the other side of the circle, another headless little guy, and a guy with a knife and a very familiar looking mask, one with an 'R' above him, and the other with an 'E' and they both seem to be coming towards you.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/7c9eca5253a1d9f463c781f064a6834f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=12722","author":{"name":"BrothersT","uid":12722,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/de11f6d1b73fb394a50ba324038e593d?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/brotherst/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12722-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12722-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12722-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12722-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12722-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12722-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12722-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12722-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12722-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12722-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?jad9b5ro4kea90m"},{"label":"BLOG (with animations)","url":"http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/author/brotherst "},{"label":"Timelapse (art, code + cam)","url":"http://youtu.be/ZWDbmqXts9U"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":81},{"area":"overall","rank":11,"score":3.89},{"area":"innovation","rank":14,"score":3.85},{"area":"fun","rank":17,"score":3.69},{"area":"audio","rank":24,"score":3.78},{"area":"graphics","rank":26,"score":4.28},{"area":"mood","rank":36,"score":3.47},{"area":"humor","rank":77,"score":2.84},{"area":"theme","rank":105,"score":2.94}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Silent Game of Death","category":"compo","description":"This is \"Silent Game of Death\" the result of my first shot at Ludum Dare. I felt it went okey until 4 hours to the end when I realized I totally forgot about the audio! At that point I still had some major features left to fix so the game simply had a change of name, from \"Game of Death\" to \"Silent Game of Death\", oh yeah you probably want to know what it's about!\n\nSilent Game of Death (SGOD) is a top-down shooter, you use the mouse buttons to control most of the action, the left button lets the ship shoot a stream of plasmabullets when held and by holding the right button the player attracts the ship towards the mouse. There is also a small help in case of emergency, press the spacebar and the ship overloads its main battery and lets out a huge energy burst! After letting out a burst the battery must recharge, preventing you too use it too often.\n\nThe enemies in this game are no ordinary aliens, since the theme of this was \"Evolution\" I began to think about using a \"Game of Life\" simulation as the enemy, your goal is simple, all you have to do is destroy the game of life, when there is no more life you win. The simulation might kill it self after a while, but that's not the points. It's all about speed, destroy all the life and prevent the simulation from evolving to set a new fastest time.\n\nThis is not a complete game, there is still a lot to add to it and I will. There is only one map shipping with this game, it contains a couple of \"gliders\" and some \"spinners\", after that the maps are randomly generated, but saved to the disk. This means that the next time you play, you can try to set a new high score(fastest time) for that specific map!\n\nOk, I feel like I covered most of it. Enjoy yourself and try to have fun with my game (even if it has no audio in it).\n\nJoakim Rosenstam","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/882f369a77b9269647ce3259e588e968.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=15147","author":{"name":"everchanger","uid":15147,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4d64dc196aa11b12e7e215605cbab767?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/everchanger/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15147-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15147-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://gamedevarena.com/LD/Silent-GOD.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://gamedevarena.com/LD/SGOD_Src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":72},{"area":"innovation","rank":131,"score":3.47},{"area":"graphics","rank":143,"score":3.58},{"area":"theme","rank":276,"score":3.14},{"area":"fun","rank":278,"score":2.97},{"area":"overall","rank":280,"score":3.14},{"area":"mood","rank":313,"score":2.74},{"area":"humor","rank":522,"score":1.67},{"area":"audio","rank":612,"score":1.13}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Sphere","category":"compo","description":"Not really a game, but my first attempt at a web game.

The HTML5 version is preferred, but the Java fallback version has better performance and can be used if the HTML5 version is too slow. To use the Java version extract the ZIP file somewhere, and if on Windows, run one of the batch files appropriate to your screen resolution. On other platforms you will need to call the JAR file manually using commands similar to those found in the batch files. Getting music in the Java version requires a 32-bit JRE. If it is installed in the default location, the batch files should be able to find it.\n\nThis game uses RTS style controls, with standard left click select and right click move. Press the middle mouse button to scroll around, or use the arrow keys.\n\nTo breed a new bacteria, select one or more of your bacteria (your bacteria have a faint blue background and show up blue on the minimap) and press B. A new bacterium will be created at your cursor. The result will be a hybrid of all the ones you have selected. You can also just order a completely random one by pressing B with none selected. You will need to do this at the beginning to get started.

For instructions on how to play, see ingame help. Playing requires a mouse.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nUPDATE 2012-08-29, by popular demand/criticism:\nHere's a longer and probably complete explanation of what's going on. This has been added AFTER the deadline, so if you want to be as confused as the first testers were, please stop reading at this line!\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCONTROLS\nEverything is mouse-only. LMB+Drag moves the map, RMB+left/right-drag rotates, LMB+RMB+Up/down-drag zooms. For convenience, arrow keys scroll as well.\n\nBLOCKS\nTo select a block, click it. The right menu changes from the Main Menu to the Block Menu. At the top, there's a representation of what's currently on this block. Click a building icon to see its stats below. If you need the space, you can order it torn down there (returning 60% of the cost). Click an empty building slot to open the build menu.\n\nBUILDING\nBuildings are grouped by their main attributes into 5 categories: Education, Luxury, Housing, Industrial and \"special\". There is one special building for each category. These can only be built when the block is completely empty, the block is suited for it (shown by colored floor) and they have really high requirements.\n\nECONOMY\nOn \"Next round\" (or 10 times a second on Autoplay), every block is affected by those in a range around it and it's new state is computed. Housing (obviously) provides living space for the population. Industry generates money, but also Pollution. Pollution makes people want to move away. The same goes for overpopulation (i.e. after demolishing an appartment tower). Luxury does the opposite, it attracts people. As a bonus, the Park also decreases Pollution. Educational facilities add to the global Education Level of the city. The Education Level determines which advanced buildings can be constructed - most builings require it, and all Special buildings require very high education levels in addition to their price.\n\nACRONYMS\nWe really like them! They look oldschool!\nPPL: Population\nRND: Round counter (the ingame date)\nMON: Money\nEDU: Education\nIND: industry (generates money)\nSPA: Living Space (how many people fit in that area)\nPOL: Pollution (the bad side effect of industry)\nLUX: Luxury (keeps people happy)\nRNG: Range (how many blocks affects this)\nLPB: how much effect is lost per unit distance\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/07d05371299802e3ee616ede18680638.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=16293","author":{"name":"Bitspace","uid":16293,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2c238f76d09efae63e33733f0eebba8f?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/bitspace/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16293-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16293-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16293-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16293-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16293-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16293-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://files.muo-game.de/GOCL1_1.zip"},{"label":"Source

Mouse aim; left click to fire.\nW, UP, SPACE: Jump.\nQ, E, ENTER: Shift weapons.\n\nThe game theme revolves around evolution, but in addition to that, enemies in the game are controlled by a massive genetic algorithm. All movement is selected at random and bred out as you succeed in killing them.\n\nThat said, this game is, ideally, self-balancing. If you go out of your way to kill enemies, you ensure that they become stronger and stronger. If you run from them, you'll probably take a licking, but they won't get any less schizophrenic.\n\nTools used:\n=================\nENIGMA Development Environment: Windowing/Graphics/Controls/Compiler\nLateralGM: Visual resource organizer\nSFXR: Simple sound effects\nGIMP: All graphics\n\nAlgorithm:\n=========================\nEnemies are equipped with a 24-protein DNA. Like ours, the DNA comprises a four-letter alphabet. Unlike ours, each letter represents an entire action, and I don't represent numerals in the same alphabet. At the beginning of the game, the behavior is generated randomly. That's why you see bugs jumping around acting all crazy-like, without really attacking. As enemies spawn, their genes are inherited from the original bug at that position, and from a second parent selected deliberately by virtue of \"merit.\"\n\nMerit is calculated by adding two factors. First, the time alive, in frames, wherein the enemy was within shooting range of you, and you had a clear shot of their exposed starting position. So if you are near a bug for 2 seconds, and fail to kill it (or just do not), the bug receives 60 points of merit.\n\nThe other factor is the damage inflicted. For each point of damage dealt, the bug who dealt it receives 200 points of merit.\n\nNow, as for the genome. I preserved the letters \"A\" \"T\" \"G\" and \"C\" out of irony.\n\nA: Attack. Drop out of hiding and let 'em have it. If the ant/termite/whatever is underground, it will flail up and blast at you from mid-air. If the eye-bug-thing is hidden, it will appear and fire unceremoniously.\n\nT: Take Cover. The ant/termite/whatever will burrow under ground, the eye-bug-thing will vanish. If a \"T\" is encountered and the bug is already hiding, it will simply come out of hiding without attack (a genetic weakness).\n\nC: Charge. You'll see a small burst of yellow sparkles as the enemy's attack power increases. Only one shot will have this added attack power.\n\nG: Go move somewhere. Ostensibly the next four letters of the DNA will say where to move; in actuality, it's just an integer, because I'm lazy. Essentially, this is coupled with a signed byte. The ant/termite/whatever moves to a position that is right of his starting position by that value (so a negative number moves him left of it). The eye-bug-thing interprets the byte as a set of polar coordinates; a positive value denotes the distance from his starting point, and a negative value denotes the direction from it.\n\n\n\nStory:\n=================================================\nYear 2512: Mutant bugs have overrun much of the earth.  \n\nOver the course of several hundred years, common insects have evolved to harness energy within them and expel it toward unsuspecting prey.  \n\nIn an effort to combat them, human scientists constructed artificial versions of their weaponry with an internal power source.\n\nDespite the hightened potency of the human weapons, the insects were able to breed at a much higher rate than they could be erradicated. Eventually, the lab was overrun from the inside, and later from the outside. \n\nThe bugs tore throgh nearly everything within the laboratory.\n\nWhile the research team is presumed dead, others hope that their findings can still be recovered. It is possible that given more time and with a better delivery mechanism, a gene therapy can be produced to reverse the effects of their evolution.\n\nYour mission is to recover any weapons and research that can be used against the bugs.\n=================================================\n\nYou begin the game with nothing but the clothes on your back. There are three weapons to collect before you can beat the game.\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/0dc12cf47055f5d9d6d0eb8f7c8a9642.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=5818","author":{"name":"Josh @ Dreamland","uid":5818,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/75b516e3ec5c2cca92a13d57bc4e34d1?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/josh-dreamland/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5818-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5818-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5818-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5818-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5818-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5818-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5818-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5818-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1052740/LudumDare/24/Submission/evolution.egm"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1052740/LudumDare/24/Submission/SuperBugs_Win32.zip"},{"label":"Linux (x64)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1052740/LudumDare/24/Submission/SuperBugs_Linux64.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1052740/LudumDare/24/Submission/SuperBugs.app.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"fun","rank":189,"score":3.16},{"area":"overall","rank":196,"score":3.31},{"area":"humor","rank":263,"score":2.4},{"area":"graphics","rank":332,"score":3.04},{"area":"mood","rank":375,"score":2.63},{"area":"theme","rank":401,"score":2.84},{"area":"innovation","rank":435,"score":2.69},{"area":"audio","rank":461,"score":2.14}],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux","mac"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Ugg's Travels","category":"jam","description":"This is a game that is pretty terrible (due to poor physics) after I tried fixing the physics for around 6 hours I gave up, I will upload the source code soon, this was made by:\nSciBerC - 15 years old - Programmer\nSciYaps - 15 years old - Graphics Artist/ Level designer\n\nYou will need the .Net 4 framework and XNA 4.0\n\nThe font (Quartz MS) made/ owned by Microsoft.\n\nthis is our first Ludum Dare and we are pretty happy with what we have by our next Ludum Dare we should be alot more wiser.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/da207ffe873cfac83b4256a72f21f3ca.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=13956","author":{"name":"SciBerC","uid":13956,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/40aa67c92e4177e7d986fac8d5b697cc?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/sciberc/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13956-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13956-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13956-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13956-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/52325119/Games/LudumDare/Ugg.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/52325119/Games/LudumDare/Ugg-source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1171,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"AdapTanks","category":"compo","description":"Initially I decided to simply have the enemy stats develop based upon what appears to be effective against the player.

After that keyboard turns green.\n\nTo compleate level you have to press specific amount proper keys in a row (streak). Required streak lenght is showed in top lefthand side screen corner.\n\nWhen you compleate all 3 levels you'll get reward. To play again you should reset levels from special menu.\n\nLevels differ amount of given time, lenght of streak, and a computer that you work on.\n\nIn future i'll add other computers and inprove graphics, so stay tuned.\n\nCheers :)\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/179f61057cd890a39aa8e415a65f358c.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14326","author":{"name":"Vircung","uid":14326,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/22b98139ad93be8b7a8e558d548be4c9?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/vircung/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14326-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14326-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14326-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14326-shot1.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14326-shot2.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14326-shot2.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14326-shot3.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14326-shot3.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows (Compo)","url":"http://goo.gl/d2RK5"},{"label":"Web (Compo)","url":"http://goo.gl/Fqg55"},{"label":"Makeing of","url":"http://goo.gl/oQhGC"},{"label":"Web (Post Compo)","url":"http://goo.gl/t5ZRH"},{"label":"Source (GitHub)","url":"http://goo.gl/tXBe9"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":57},{"area":"humor","rank":208,"score":2.6},{"area":"audio","rank":600,"score":1.2},{"area":"mood","rank":691,"score":1.24},{"area":"innovation","rank":741,"score":1.71},{"area":"graphics","rank":748,"score":1.41},{"area":"theme","rank":756,"score":1.17},{"area":"fun","rank":757,"score":1.35},{"area":"overall","rank":758,"score":1.55}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Build that tower!","category":"jam","description":"This is Build that tower!

version)\nDrawings : Paint Tool Sai and Photoshop\nMusic : GarageBand (yeah, i suck at music so i just assembled some loops :<)\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n=======\nIt's my first time participating in this event so of course, I thought something too big for me so I couldn't finished in time for the other LD48. \n\nIt's not totally finished, polished and tested, but I hope someone will be able to finish it at least once. \n\nSTORY:\n====\nAs a newborn, your character has not yet a personality. He is very motivated to be someone, but there are obstacles on his way. \nGrown up monsters will try to discourage him from growing up and bully you.\nFortunately, his friends will support him and cheer him up.\n\nHis evolution into someone good or evil will depend on positive and negative support from his environment.\n\nThe more positive energy you get, the better you will become. \nHowever, if you receive too much negative energy, your character will give up and become a bad person.\n\nGOAL:\n====\nEach word will affect your determination represented by your positive energy points (blue bar).\nPositive word will give you positive points.\nNegative word will make you loose positive points.\n\nYou start at 100 points, try to get 1000 points to finish the game.\nThe game is over if you reach 0 positive points (determination loss) OR 1000 negative points.\n\nCONTROLS:\n=====\n- Use the arrow keys (left and right) to move forward and backward on screen.  Try collect positive words and avoid negative ones.\n- Double dash by pressing an horizontal arrow key twice.\n- Jump with the up arrow key. \n- You can double jump in mid-air.\n\nUPDATE:\n- 28/08/2012 : Added Web Player link (I forgot Unity3D could do this one...)\n\n\nHave fun !\n\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/1abf66082841f9d903da4665165418aa.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=15526","author":{"name":"ReveLorenfield","uid":15526,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2f123e238bc9b10749569bb7700f84cd?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/revelorenfield/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15526-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15526-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15526-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15526-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15526-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15526-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15526-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15526-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?y3nstyb6ul5zu74"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?x9e2xvlqz3hezwk"},{"label":"Web (Unity3D)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/40501912/LD48-24/PursuitOfTrueSelf-Web.html"},{"label":"Youtube gameplay","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZPC029F3rI"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":72},{"area":"graphics","rank":42,"score":4},{"area":"mood","rank":53,"score":3.29},{"area":"theme","rank":61,"score":3.3},{"area":"humor","rank":74,"score":2.85},{"area":"audio","rank":76,"score":3.29},{"area":"fun","rank":88,"score":3.11},{"area":"overall","rank":89,"score":3.29},{"area":"innovation","rank":93,"score":3.08}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Rise of the Meebas","category":"compo","description":"Rise of the Meebas is my puzzle-platformer/sadistic torture app for LD#24 - Evolution.\nGuide the Meebas through the caves and as they evolve, they will be able to take on increasingly difficult challenges!

Each opponent starts in a corner with the three monsters that are on their side. Its more fun if you find someone to play with you.\n\nUse the turns to either move yourself into a protective defensive position.  Or use your monsters turn to breed them a nearby monster that you click on or train one of your monsters by making him fight with either another one of you monsters or your opponents monster.\n\nThe winner is whoever gets their monsters to the opponent and fights with him.  \n\nHere's how the game works:\n\nEach team starts with 1 player and 3 monsters.  The color, size and particle effect height represent the strength of the monster.  Whenever the player gets attacked, that side has lost.\n\nWhen you control a unit, they have a green tile under them, and all the people on their team have black tiles under them.  That's how you tell who's turn it is.\n\nMost actions involve two clicks, the click to select the action, and the click to select the target.  All actions can only be used in the 8 tiles around the active unit.\n\nWhen you breed two monsters: both are destroyed.  Then 4 new monsters are placed above, below, to the left and to the right of the target monster.  These monsters have stats that can be up to as much as the added stats of their parents.  You must control both monsters.\n\nWhen two monsters fight:  Each picks one of: red, green or blue.  They tend to pick the color they look most like.  A monster who is equally green and red will choose both with equal frequency.  Once they pick a color, one of the monsters may get a 2x bonus depending on the color they picked.  The bigger monster wins.\n\nRed beats Green, Green Beats Blue, Blue beats Red.\n\nIf you're really interested in how combat plays out, here's an example:\n\nMonster 'A' has:\n{red: 70, blue: 30, green: 0}\nfights Monster 'B' with:\n{red: 33, blue: 35, green: 32}\n\nAB A B %\nRR _ X 23.1\nRB X X 24.5\nRG _ X 22.4\nBR _ X 9.9\nBB X _ 10.5\nBG X _ 0.6","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/6ee189367c454bccaec4f323afbd1e95.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=9290","author":{"name":"foxor","uid":9290,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2a4463357cdb79a2c1307397cc0f1c99?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/foxor/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/9290-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/9290-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.isaacjames.com/ld24/CandyWars.exe"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.isaacjames.com/ld24/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.isaacjames.com/ld24/src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":308,"score":3},{"area":"theme","rank":529,"score":2.48},{"area":"coolness","rank":618,"score":46},{"area":"mood","rank":690,"score":1.31},{"area":"overall","rank":691,"score":2.29},{"area":"graphics","rank":712,"score":1.86},{"area":"fun","rank":736,"score":1.67}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Challenge Evolve","category":"compo","description":"This is my first attempt at LD.

The game doesn't include the much needed instructions, as I spent the last few hours fixing what I'd broken. Also, it was never intended to have a bot playing it. It's strictly multiplayer.\n\nThe music was improvised by Andre Sobral, a friend of mine who's a professional guitarist: http://sobral-avainferi-wako.blogspot.pt/\n\n--------------------------------\n\nThis is a Chess variant with an emphasis on promoting your pieces. In each turn, you may move/capture (just like in regular Chess) or you may promote one of your pieces. It's a multiplayer game, but unfortunately you have to play in on a single computer.\n\nThe board is divided in to 3 types of terrain: Sea, Land and Castle. Only Sea units may move on the Sea, only Land units may move on Land and all units can move in the Castles. Units close to the opposite type of terrain have the option of promoting to a different terrain version of the same piece (e.g. a Land pawn can promote to a Sea pawn).\n\nThe goal of the game is to \"checkmate\" the enemy castle (the 8 squares colored black, white or shades of grey, half belonging to each side). However, because of the time constraints the game doesn't know when the game has been won, so you have to confirm by yourself.\n\nBy reaching the final row, instead of promoting to whichever piece you want, you earn the option to promote to a Knight (though not immediately), which is the strongest piece in Promotion Chess. Knights are Flying units, which means they can move wherever they want.\n\nThis isn't explained in the game because I didn't have time, so here's how each piece moves. Please refer to the second \"screenshot\" (it's not really from the game) for graphic instructions.\n\n- Pawn (starting unit): These are just regular old pawns. They move and capture like in Chess.\n- Land-side Pawn: These move/capture one square diagonally. They're only available on the land side.\n- Sea-side Pawn: Moves/captures 1 square forward or 1 square to either side.\n- Square with a hole in the middle: Moves/captures like the King in Chess; 1 square in any direction\n- Cross-shaped thing: Can move/capture 3 squares to either side or 1 square forward/backward\n- Double-crossed-shaped thing: Moves/captures 2 squares diagonally and can reflect off the sides of the board or off terrain it can't walk on.\n- Knight: Just like in Chess.\n\nThis really isn't a convenient game. Not only is it single-computer multiplayer, it doesn't include in-game instructions. However, it's a pretty interesting design, so please give it a try if you've got someone to play with. Thanks!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/185fa3bcee66428a21b0da0d893db82e.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=1477","author":{"name":"Petzi","uid":1477,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e720844e7c57e26577a59090908255d2?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/petzi/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1477-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1477-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1477-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1477-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/17269641/promotion_chess.rar"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":67,"score":3.25},{"area":"audio","rank":121,"score":2.85},{"area":"theme","rank":191,"score":2.29},{"area":"mood","rank":228,"score":2},{"area":"overall","rank":249,"score":2.24},{"area":"fun","rank":253,"score":1.88},{"area":"graphics","rank":268,"score":1.63},{"area":"coolness","rank":832,"score":33}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Rabbit Evolution","category":"compo","description":"Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe game is set in current times, where it is common to see laboratories doing research with animals.\nThe idea of the game is the evolution of a rabbit that has mutated which released his intelligence, but the government does not want to make this public disclosure and will kill the rabbit.

The mines reopened. The money poured back into the county as the international Cybernetic Implant market boomed. To avoid the distasteful strikes and greed of capitalist mining companies, AI Entities were implemented to run the country's larger concerns. South Africa was important again. It was the only country that seemed to have an endless supply of the metal needed for complete cybernetic integration. \n\nDe Beers, once almost bankrupt, became a \"world power\" and extend their operation to the manufacture and sales of Cybernetic Implants. Those who could afford the implants became more powerful, more intelligent, lived longer, looked beautiful and, of course, wealthier. Technology and science prevailed. Workers were given implants so they could lift and extract more from the deep tunnelling mines. \n\nWhile De Beers continued its climb as a world player inequality and disparity grew drastically. The Cities started to separate, half slums and ghettos and the rest pristine technological wonders. The Rand became the most sought after currency in the world. The Government started to appoint De Beers board members into all the major positions and they grew fat. \n\nFor some time this turmoil reigned over the country. Protests, uprisings and strikes were quelled with hysterical violence. How can a mere man compete with the CRP (Cybernetic Regulation Police)? These \"policemen\" were hardly men; their augmentation was almost complete. Their regulations were only there to protect those already in power. \n\nThe 11 Judges of the Constitutional Court led the only modicum of resistance in favour of the Old Democracy. The Court was allowed to exist only while the Government tried to maintain their international image as the \"Rainbow Nation\". They had no real power; their decisions were never implemented; they served as a glorious illusion of the prosperity and sanctity of augmented life. They did however organise rallies, spend days in court holding the De Beers board members in contempt and generally being a nuance. They continued this meagre resistance for years, never quite achieving what they hoped to, never quite brave enough. \n\nOver the years the city has been torn apart. The implants gave those who could afford them too much power, too much wealth and too much beauty. It drove all of them mad. \n\nIt was after the 2022 murder of the Chief Justice that action was taken. The ConCourt rallied the people and isolated the CBD from the rest of Joburg. They built massive walls, expelled most of those who had implants and declared themselves independent. \n\nFor 8 years following they were under besieged. The siege only ended after those on the other side of the wall lost their sanity. The implants drove them mad and they became violent scavenging animals. De Beers and South Africa collapsed. All that remained was the ConCourt and the 2 million in the CBD.\n\nCreative Commons; Map Data is Copyright © 2012 AfriGIS (Pty) Ltd., Google.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/765728482e510209bd66b75e4afd2154.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=7278","author":{"name":"ProjectX","uid":7278,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/677ee99f606bd5a7d9fda7db458a6eb7?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/projectx/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7278-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7278-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7278-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7278-shot1.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7278-shot2.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7278-shot2.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7278-shot3.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7278-shot3.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://gamejam.co.za/Games/ReConstitution_Hill"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1171,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Sun God","category":"compo","description":"IMPORTANT NOTE: Use PageUp/PageDown to zoom in or out!

But unfortunately this idea proved to be too much for my limited experience and time.\nAlso, I used up too much time composing a 4 minute soundtrack which some of it didn't get used.\n\nEnjoy it somehow!\n \n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/84c7774718ed61fe49a43814664258b4.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=16518","author":{"name":"cricklewood","uid":16518,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6891070145663e796762f834470e1181?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/cricklewood/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16518-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16518-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/42402228/Adaptation/index.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1080,"score":14}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Castle Defender","category":"compo","description":"My first enrty to Ludum Dare.\nDidn't have much time, so don't expect the best game.\n\nGet Love2D from here: http://love2d.org","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/74bb948e273de40da51c443fb5f975c0.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=11722","author":{"name":"mad1231999","uid":11722,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d959997242f4705198f8560b14c4e2c4?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/mad1231999/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11722-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11722-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hg48c1yk88ylnid/LudumDare24.zip"},{"label":"OS/X(needs Love2D install)","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hg48c1yk88ylnid/LudumDare24.zip"},{"label":"Linux(needs Love2D install)","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hg48c1yk88ylnid/LudumDare24.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://www.github.com/M-Clausen/LudumDare24"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1171,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"CellVolution","category":"compo","description":"Link: http://www.tsj666games.altervista.org/ZipFileCV/CellVolution.zip\n\nHere it is!\nIt doesn't really fit the theme, but it's not completely wrong, so what the hell!\nI worked so hard and I'm pretty proud of it.\nSo, let me introduce you...\n|---------------------|\n| CELLVOLUTION |\n|---------------------|","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/7df207bbf3397cee69a766371b655fce.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=10565","author":{"name":"TSJ666","uid":10565,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3134f63cebc9dd29db59a86afd29fda5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/tsj666/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10565-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10565-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10565-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10565-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10565-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10565-shot2.png"}],"links":[],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":54},{"area":"mood","rank":302,"score":2.76},{"area":"audio","rank":308,"score":2.58},{"area":"theme","rank":316,"score":3.04},{"area":"graphics","rank":317,"score":3.08},{"area":"fun","rank":321,"score":2.88},{"area":"overall","rank":425,"score":2.88},{"area":"humor","rank":493,"score":1.76},{"area":"innovation","rank":619,"score":2.23}],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"ColourTron","category":"compo","description":"Use the coloured blocks to destroy the barriers and reach the other side of the screen.

When any two Mesh pixels overlap, they're knocked loose and float freely. Pick up the free pixels to regenerate yourself. If your \"brain\" pixel collides with anything, your entire Mesh will explode (game over).\n\nNot Working: The idea was that you'd add a pixel onto your Mesh at the end of every level (evolution). Play would start each level in the same \"+\" form, but as you gathered more pixels you'd grow into your final form.\n\nI was planning to make ~10 or 20 levels (there's an AI system complete for setting up paths for the AIs and the engine supports resizing to much smaller pixel resolutions). After 20 \"set\" levels, you'd enter a free-form arena where you battle your ancestors!\n\nStretch Goal: I'd also love to add support for multi-tier Meshes--a \"mount point\" would act as a second-tier brain. You could add pixels to either your main Mesh or your sub-Mesh, and even define paths for your sub-Mesh (think rotating blades or Dhalsim-arms).\n\nMega Stretch: It would be pretty easy to store all these in a database and load random enemy meshes to battle against (offline). It would be harder, but pretty cool, to make a live battle arena.\n\n\nsource link is the specific commit for the entry--i'll probably keep tinkering with it, but that source will construct the SWF i linked to as my \"play\" entry","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/bc018dc5c3e09af0e5ddd164792aaefc.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=15570","author":{"name":"SimianLogic","uid":15570,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c4cad413c9d6fef51eccbcdb4a727aba?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/simianlogic/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15570-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15570-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15570-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15570-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15570-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15570-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15570-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15570-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.simianlogic3d.com/fun/mesh/"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/SimianLogic/Mesh_LD24/tree/feaa16479d7aa5148d89088d45112e9f08bfddf7"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":51},{"area":"innovation","rank":31,"score":3.88},{"area":"fun","rank":239,"score":3.04},{"area":"overall","rank":442,"score":2.85},{"area":"humor","rank":595,"score":1.38},{"area":"theme","rank":598,"score":2.29},{"area":"mood","rank":623,"score":2.05},{"area":"graphics","rank":682,"score":2.04}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Monkeyectomy","category":"compo","description":"Straight from the readme:\n\nHello and welcome to my second Ludum Dare entry!\n\nI made this in the span of six hours this morning, after two other ideas just didn't work at all.\nI had figured I'd drop out of the LD this time around but hey, look what happened today! :D\n\nYou may notice it is an incredibly small resolution: it's 160x144, the same resolution as the Gameboy Color.

To compile from source, you'll need LibGDX (~Aug 24, 2012).\n\n\"Gameplay\" is limited to tweaking the three stats for your Religion and letting it rip.  There are various controls to pause and change the speed of the simulator.

The traits that you can tweak are mostly violent (dramatic population changing) ones--I would have liked to have modeled peaceful conversions if there was time, as well as more frivolous stuff.  The sim also needs some way to depict splitting / Schisms in addition to mutation, to really be an evolutionary sim.  Oh well.

I think this part would be improved in the next LD.\n\n- Audio: no audio, between now and December (next LD) I think I'll learn how to add audio in SDL.\n\nNothing else, I'm very happy to contribute to this event.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/341f742d56f405f2ec069ce8ab85aa63.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=16480","author":{"name":"Xaconi","uid":16480,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2a8628f9cef8094682efba91b7b7d645?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/xaconi/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16480-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16480-shot0.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/uj5pc2dqf9i6jx7/Survival%20Sea.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1171,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Tonality","category":"compo","description":"Can you sequence the bacteria's DNA fast enough to keep them in check as they grow and mutate?\n\nNote: You need sound enabled on your computer in order to play this game.\n\nTo run: You should just need to download the JAR and run it.

one of the bundles I've created.\n\n-- INSTRUCTIONS ------------------------\nOpen up the game, make sure to read the text. It'll tell you what you need to do.\n\n\nSOUND\nIf you do not want sound, use the command line argument \"nosound\". Not sure if this will work with the bundles, but it very well may.\n\nExample:\n\nlove ./path/to/And\\ Thus\\ She\\ Spake.love nosound\n\n\nINPUT\nThis game works best with a mouse. Trackpads tend to be jerky because you have to keep picking up your fingers.\n\n\n-- INSTALLATION ------------------------\n\nAll of the bundles have been compressed into an archive container of some sort, so all you need to do with them is unzip to where you want them, and play!\n\nNOTE: For Ubuntu (and other distro) users, I apologize, I do not know enough about packaging apps in linux to really give bundling a shot. Perhaps for next LD, if I don't go back to the web!\n\nNOTE: For the windows x64 bundle, I cannot test it out since I do not have a 64 bit install. If anyone reports a problem, I'll just take the bundle down. If you don't see a bundle, I'd just recommend getting LOVE from their website (love2d.org).\n\nSome quick instructions for installing love (refer to love2d.org for full instructions):\n\nUBUNTU (PPA)\n- sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bartbes/love-stable\n- sudo apt-get update\n- sudo apt-get install love\n\nOS X:\n- get https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/love-0.8.0-macosx-ub.zip\n- unzip and install into your applications directory\n- right click on And Thus She Spake.love, Open With -> Other...\n- check Always Open With and browse and select the love.app you just copied to your applications directory\n\nWINDOWS (32-BIT):\n- download and run installer: https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/love-0.8.0-win-x86.exe\n\nWINDOWS (64-BIT)\n- download and run installer: https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/love-0.8.0-win-x64.exe\n\nOTHER\n- You can get the source code, zipped versions for Windows (instead of an installer), and specific Ubuntu versions for various releases and for 32/64-bit versions, just take a look at love2d.org","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/65aa17eeadcf232d3ba2cd2271cdb2ce.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=7263","author":{"name":"pbdiode","uid":7263,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f0af2f99b39df43c6d94aa81dec0141b?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/pbdiode/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7263-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7263-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"LOVE File","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/48144436/LD48/24/And%20Thus%20She%20Spake.love"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/48144436/LD48/24/AndThusSheSpake-osx.zip"},{"label":"Windows x64","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/48144436/LD48/24/AndThusSheSpake-win-x64.zip"},{"label":"Windows x86","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/48144436/LD48/24/AndThusSheSpake-win-x86.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/zombified/ld48-24"}],"ratings":[{"area":"fun","rank":154,"score":3.25},{"area":"audio","rank":250,"score":2.76},{"area":"mood","rank":274,"score":2.82},{"area":"overall","rank":287,"score":3.13},{"area":"humor","rank":298,"score":2.27},{"area":"innovation","rank":399,"score":2.78},{"area":"theme","rank":510,"score":2.54},{"area":"coolness","rank":570,"score":49},{"area":"graphics","rank":641,"score":2.18}],"platforms":["win","mac","linux","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"CellAnt","category":"compo","description":"Cellular automata ant colony game. Control your own colony of ants in your battle to take over the environment and evolve your ants to specialise in particular skills. But be warned, the other AI colonies wont take too kindly to having their territory invaded!\n\nAnts start with a length of 2 blocks, these are the \"children\" and cannot reproduce, after 120 seconds these become \"adults\" and gain a 3rd block (this is how they remain for most their life, before becoming old [4 blocks] and then dying of old age).\nDuring the life of your ants they can be assigned one of 3 tasks, digging, reproduction or fighting/attacking. The chance of each of these succeeding is based on the ants level in the respective area (and so will not always work first time, be patient). A child ant takes the highest of its parents levels, and breeding specialised ants is to your advantage. The colour of the ants head indicates how specialised it is the 3 stats (R,G,B colour components, one for each stat).\nAnts move randomly around the grid unless you use the \"Set Target\" button and click another ant to head towards, the selected ant is highlighted green and the target red, if you cannot see the target use the \"Find Target\" button to centre it in your view.\nSome of the blocks that your ants dig are converted into indestructible blocks (shown in the HUD) which can be placed for your own amusement with right click.\n\nThere is some sound! for death, killing and reproduction. If you play it long enough you may hear them ;)\n\nExtract the entire zip before attempting to run!\n\nMay also run on OS/X and Linux using mono (tested and working on ubuntu 12.04 with mono-devel package and suitable opengl drivers)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/f786d023d35b3dea186e2d999cb296c0.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=15242","author":{"name":"Bzaraticus","uid":15242,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2d62c84b2d6ac5bb4df4d73e6c54e7a1?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/bzaraticus/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15242-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15242-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15242-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15242-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows/Linux/OSX","url":"http://www.leet.cc/CellAnt_Build.zip"},{"label":"Mono (Required for OSX and Linux)","url":"http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.leet.cc/0CellAnt_Source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":95},{"area":"innovation","rank":229,"score":3.18},{"area":"theme","rank":324,"score":3.02},{"area":"mood","rank":465,"score":2.45},{"area":"humor","rank":488,"score":1.77},{"area":"overall","rank":526,"score":2.7},{"area":"graphics","rank":550,"score":2.43},{"area":"audio","rank":567,"score":1.48},{"area":"fun","rank":696,"score":1.91}],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux","mac"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Beetlefield : The Forecast","category":"compo","description":"---- GOAL ----\n\nBid for the team that will win the battle.\nIf you success the loser team gain a new evolution. \nThen, you'll have to think again the issue of next battle until you fail.\n\n---- DNA CODE ----\n\nOn the gameover screen you can generate a DNA Code for saving the best beetles team.\nYou can exchange those codes with friends and make them fight in the skirmish mode.\n\n---- MY BEST DNA ----\n\n->  benjamin;10;0;6;1;9;7c940 <-\nplease tell me if you can beat it :)\n\n---- WARNING ----\n\nI had no time for a loading screen so please be patient with the white page :)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/9ee8faff946b7d341f12619fa7d95e73.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=2952","author":{"name":"Benjamin","uid":2952,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d3ad03e91ef9147ec0358d1022129121?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/benjamin-soule/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2952-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2952-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2952-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2952-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2952-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2952-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://ncannasse.fr/file/beetlefield/index.html"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jSxixymHqA"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5708192/LD24/src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"innovation","rank":3,"score":4.26},{"area":"overall","rank":5,"score":4.17},{"area":"theme","rank":7,"score":4.34},{"area":"fun","rank":24,"score":3.81},{"area":"audio","rank":39,"score":3.66},{"area":"graphics","rank":39,"score":4.16},{"area":"mood","rank":100,"score":3.3},{"area":"humor","rank":224,"score":2.53}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Dorobou Neko!","category":"compo","description":"I......................'m...............done............................................\n\nOK, here you go with Postman Chicky in 'Dorobou Neko'!!

If you really can't stand the major graphical glitch of the original version (like I do), do give the updated one a try!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/75acccb12fd1031e6aa6e2a1edc54dc3.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=16255","author":{"name":"Joana","uid":16255,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/52874ae6de87bf5a22d9c96796307643?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/iohanna/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16255-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16255-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7510280/Games/LudumDare24/GoldenEgg_Win.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7510280/Games/LudumDare24/GoldenEgg_Mac.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7510280/Games/LudumDare24/Golden%20Egg/WebPlayer/WebPlayer.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://bitbucket.org/iohanna/golden-eggs"},{"label":"Web (Updated)","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7510280/Games/LudumDare24/Golden%20Egg/v0.8/WebPlayer/WebPlayer.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":158,"score":3.53},{"area":"mood","rank":352,"score":2.67},{"area":"innovation","rank":556,"score":2.41},{"area":"theme","rank":579,"score":2.35},{"area":"fun","rank":647,"score":2.12},{"area":"overall","rank":667,"score":2.33},{"area":"coolness","rank":816,"score":35}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Men In Wings","category":"compo","description":"Unfinished.

However, if your species does survive, at the end of the game you're given a summary based on the scores.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/3e20e6600b1f18d84674e1e527069764.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=13914","author":{"name":"garygreen","uid":13914,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/32ceacb380a21dcdf07131a7bbb7e808?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/garygreen/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13914-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/13914-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web/Scratch site","url":"http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/garygreen/2748603"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jx1dz4t57o0xeh5/ZLFEoof3Ao"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":91},{"area":"innovation","rank":208,"score":3.21},{"area":"audio","rank":343,"score":2.5},{"area":"humor","rank":449,"score":1.86},{"area":"theme","rank":458,"score":2.67},{"area":"mood","rank":630,"score":2.03},{"area":"graphics","rank":661,"score":2.11},{"area":"overall","rank":705,"score":2.21},{"area":"fun","rank":709,"score":1.83}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Adventure-Man vs the Evo Monsters!","category":"jam","description":"Here's my entry for the game jam!\n\nUnfortunately, since I stupidly used GameSalad, there are inexplicable problems that only appear after uploading and publishing to their Arcade site.

it was backwards, it was supposed to target civilian units before military ones\n-Fixed horse archer - after researching it, it wasnt listed in the city build menu sometimes\n-Fixed barbarian spawn rates (was glitched, always spawned, and too often)\n-Fixed F3 ending the turn, and F1 now correctly cycles turns fast.\n-Fixed barbarian healthbars appearing in fog of war\n-Unit select fixed, sometimes not selecting units\n-Barbarians fortify fixed- they stop moving when hp is less than max (so hp is restored)\n-A battle now correctly cancels a \"move to\" action\n-Cities now correctly make the last made unit, when done production\n-Horsearcher tech now correctly requires warrior tech\n-Years were incorrectly growing by 100 years/turn up until 3000AD, not 3000BC, which is fixed  (purely trivial counter but still)\n\nKnown issues:\n-S settles a city, but is also the alternate down key.\n-When research finishes, the city doesn't update status to clarify that (but it does finish, it just says \"building research\" instead, indefinitely, which does nothing).\n\nEDIT3:  List of features I managed to do in 48h:\n-Fully working (excluding the fixed glitches) 4X engine with unit movement (including a primitive move-to), health, battles.\n-Primitive barbarian AI and spawning, which wander until near a unit or city, and head towards it -

each unit has a specific movement, and terrain affects it - mountains cost a lot of movement, rivers a lot too, roads are much faster\n-Improving tiles - workers can be built, that can build farms, roads, quarries, mines, plant or remove forests or clear improvements\n-Can create new cities with colonists.\n-Very little but still *some* unit variety (A weak Conscript, a moderate Warrior, a moderate but fast Horse-archer, against your standard Barbarian)\n-Units affected by terrain (stronger if on a mountain or river, weaker in desert or tundra if I remember my code correctly)\n-Healthbars, but the bugfix release may have broken them altogether.\n-Save/load (F2 to save, F3 to load, F5 quicksave, F6 quickload)\n-Basic text UI, but it should suffice.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/39670d4e0a5ad88cff133efbb8cc23b1.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=5791","author":{"name":"Spaceoff","uid":5791,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0cd8e05e4e44f0ea10a4dcdbe85d93e6?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/spaceoff/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5791-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5791-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5791-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5791-shot1.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5791-shot2.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5791-shot2.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5791-shot3.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5791-shot3.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows (BUGFIX RELEASE)","url":"http://localhostr.com/3TbiUm9guYCL"},{"label":"Windows (original)","url":"http://localhostr.com/xUy3m0DluP4e"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://localhostr.com/6QEkzB6vcx5t"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpyG4wB18Dg  "}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":73},{"area":"overall","rank":79,"score":3.62},{"area":"mood","rank":139,"score":3.13},{"area":"graphics","rank":176,"score":3.46},{"area":"fun","rank":222,"score":3.08},{"area":"theme","rank":340,"score":2.97},{"area":"innovation","rank":474,"score":2.61},{"area":"humor","rank":481,"score":1.78},{"area":"audio","rank":490,"score":2}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Fantasy Map Tactics","category":"compo","description":"FANTASY MAP TACTICS\n\nViva la evolution!\n\nThe evil red science-denier armies are slowly roaming the land looking for blood. \n\nYou control three green unarmed bards intent on swiftly spreading the word about science to the Mapletree kingdom.\n\nCapture 15 cities to rule the kingdom while avoiding any bloodshed!\n\n----------------\n\nI've always loved the \"fantasy maps\" that you find at the beginning of all fantasy novels (LOTR, Game of Thrones, etc). There's something exciting about seeing the map, with all sorts of interesting looking places just begging to be explored. I thought it would be fun to make a turn-based strategy tactics wargame based on this visual style.\n\nI created my game in HTML5 using jquery, because something like this doesn't need 3d rendering performance, and because it is very easy to turn the game into a mobile (android, ios and ouya) app using phonegap. \n\nI started by first drawing some typical fantasy map icons using marker on paper. After scanning in the images and creating a spritesheet, I wrote a simple random map grid creation class. It uses deterministic random procedurally-generated terrain (a seeded mersenne twister PRNG) so that a complex map can be recalled with a single integer seed value (no need to save a huge array to disk/cookie/localstorage). I then add extra water tiles around the edges by varying the shoreline randomly. \n\nFinally, I scatter hamlets, towns, cities, forts and castles in non-blocked tiles and give them random location names by combining two syllables from an array of three-letter strings. \n\nThis results in a fantasy book-style map with scattered forests, mountains, hills, swamps, and deserts that hold a plethora of interesting-sounding locations.\n\nFinally, I implemented an A-Star pathfinding algorithm that can navigate a character around obstacles to get to any waypoint on the map (the green and red dots: green is how far you will move in a single turn before running out of \"energy\"). \n\nI also coded a line-of-sight (LOS) algorithm for use in the combat, which means that eventually projectiles and magic spells could be cast in a straight line but would be blocked by mountains or towns. The white dots are tiles that you are able to \"see\" - but in this version you control peace-loving bards with no attack skills.\n\nHOW TO PLAY:\n\nThis game is more like CHESS or a puzzle game than a typical tactics title like Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem. \n\nDrag with the mouse button held down to scroll the map. You can zoom in and out with the + and - buttons.\n\nIf you want to restart with a completely different random map, enter any number into the box in the top left and click the world button.\n\nYour green bards move very fast but die instantly if touched by a red army (unless you are really lucky). The red enemies move very slowly, but you are vastly outnumbered.\n\nChoose which army you want to control by clicking the buttons on the bottom in the middle. \n\nClick the location you want to move to and advance the turn (bottom left button) to start moving. \n\nYou only get ONE order per turn, so choose wisely.\n\nENJOY!\n\nPost Compo (JAM) edition: featuring enhanced terrain generation and new sprites for proper shorelines!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e64a820708c0ca7c481c8c97048f44d7.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=2297","author":{"name":"McFunkypants","uid":2297,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/90dd410a837fb6f38b309f7f2bc989cb?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/mcfunkypants/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2297-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2297-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2297-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2297-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2297-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2297-shot2.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2297-shot3.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2297-shot3.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2297-shot4.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2297-shot4.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (HTML5)","url":"http://www.mcfunkypants.com/LD24/"},{"label":"Jam (Post Compo) Version","url":"http://www.mcfunkypants.com/LD24/jam"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.mcfunkypants.com/LD24/src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":92,"score":3.81},{"area":"mood","rank":134,"score":3.15},{"area":"fun","rank":229,"score":3.07},{"area":"overall","rank":249,"score":3.19},{"area":"innovation","rank":253,"score":3.14},{"area":"audio","rank":328,"score":2.54},{"area":"humor","rank":409,"score":1.96},{"area":"theme","rank":689,"score":1.83},{"area":"coolness","rank":691,"score":42}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Fungus Wars with Tone Matrix","category":"compo","description":"Note: Fixed.

Well, you've got a block, and you can capture some other blocks to grow. But take care of the color of the blocks because each one gives you special ability (see Intro section of the menu). And you can get killed by bigger/stronger combinations.\nIf you manage to grow enough, a boss will spawn.\nHe is easy to kill because i didn't have time to implement everything (see section bellow).\n\nWhat's next?\n- Web version: there's one but I've got performance issues at this time.\n- Android version: it's working but there's huge performance issues. I'm working on it.\n- Multiplayer: I just need a little bit of motivation (tell me if you'd like it!)\n\n<SPOILER>\nI like to make people understand things by playing but if you can't find out the logic of this game, read the next lines.\nOk so you die and you don't understand why. There are 3 main kind of blocks (red, yellow, green).\n- Red gives 3 of power, but no speed\n- Yellow gives 1 of power, but 10 speed\n- Green is your protection against insta kills, but if the enemy is far (x3) too stronger than you, it won't protect you.\nYour blue block is 2 of attack, so you can kill yellow and green, but get killed by red. If you have 1 yellow, red won't kill you. If you have 2 yellow, you can kill a red.\n\nIf you can't find the boss, just go up when the message appears.\nHave fun.\n</SPOILER>\n\nA web version will be available soon. Maybe android too.\n\nI hope you will have fun!\nIf you liked it, please leave me a comment. And if you found my game sucks please don't tell because it would break my heart! I put too much of myself in the making of this game :D (just kidding, don't hesitate to point out some problems)\n\nAbout the making of this game:\n\nHi everyone!\nThis is my second LD and this time I am a very happy with my work because it is far better than my last game! Plus, I learned to use some cool tools like libgdx and bfxr.\nI also learned some tips about java during this LD, so my programming skills have been improved too.\n\nThe bad thing is that i spent 48 hours working on a primary idea and i had to throw everything away because my first project was far too complex to be made by me in 48/72h (My first project was to make a game where each level reprensented a different kind of game... Too many bugs...). You can take a look at the source code of my first project there: https://github.com/eoj/Evolution\nSo i made this game alone and in 24 hours (minus 3 hours of sleeptime!). I really killed myself making it because I didn't want to drop the LD, or send a game I wouldn't be proud of.\n\nI feel so happy and tired now :)\n\nAbout Evolution:\n\nI voted for Evolution because I though this theme was good to make some new gameplays but finally it was hard to find an idea both feasible and interesting.\nMaybe 1000 kittens would have been better. I had some good ideas about parallel world.\n\nCredits for the font: Yuji Hochimoto\nCredits for the music: Ozzed http://ozzed.net/\n\nTwitter: @DaMightyCthulhu","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ed67bca796f88bed4a0e1d0f2dbc3421.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14665","author":{"name":"Cthulhu","uid":14665,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fc9ce5eccb6619de49897bdeb2129397?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/cthulhu/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14665-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14665-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14665-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14665-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14665-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14665-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows / Linux / Mac","url":"http://0xg.fr/game.jar"},{"label":"Android (Post Compo)","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.me.cleverblocks"},{"label":"Sources","url":"https://github.com/eoj/CleverBlocks"}],"ratings":[{"area":"fun","rank":3,"score":4.03},{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":65},{"area":"overall","rank":15,"score":3.84},{"area":"innovation","rank":15,"score":3.84},{"area":"theme","rank":27,"score":3.69},{"area":"audio","rank":46,"score":3.53},{"area":"mood","rank":66,"score":3.22},{"area":"graphics","rank":141,"score":3.16},{"area":"humor","rank":158,"score":2}],"platforms":["desktop","java","mobile"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Convergent","category":"compo","description":"Run the runme.sh or runmeinwindows.bat, depending on your platform.\n\nIf they don't work, try running \"java -jar ./Convergence.jar\" from the command line.\n\nTips:\nYour amount of blocks on the left hand side is your health.\nIf you lose all your health, the game will pause until you gain some more (you can't lose, though the game may crash at some point (that is a kind of losing)).\nMatch up different blocks side by side to improve your capabilities - place a damage enhancer (green sword) or rate of fire enhancer (green dots) next to a gun block to fire better.

The main thing that's missing is a win condition. At first, you were just going to get three chances to beat any one level. If you died three times in a row: game over. Your score would have been either the number of levels completed or the number of generations survived. We scrapped that though after realizing that some levels took a lot more than three tries to \"figure out\" and that it was quite satisfying to finally beat them. Now we're thinking about having a set number of levels and your score would simply be your completion time.\n\nThe level generation uses a genetic algorithm. You play a set of procedurally generated levels, and the game evaluates them for fitness; then, it takes the most fit levels and mates them together, creating a new generation of offspring levels. Since there is no mutation and the levels only have a single \"chromosome\", they tend to evolve into a very uniform population after a few generations, which eventually leads to getting very similar levels until you restart, and since there is no win or end condition to force a restart, you can essentially get stuck playing levels that are nearly identical to one another repeatedly.\n\nThere are also a lot of sound effects we didn't get around to putting in but those will be added in future versions.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/bec991464eb2d573b8df392c601b66e5.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=12165","author":{"name":"Incredible Ape","uid":12165,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b89af7e25f12d4c40cf4559f934ebdca?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/incredible-ape/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12165-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12165-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12165-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12165-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12165-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12165-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12165-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12165-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12165-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/12165-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://schonstal.org/swf/LudumGame.swf"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/schonstal/ludum-dare-24"}],"ratings":[{"area":"fun","rank":10,"score":3.82},{"area":"overall","rank":21,"score":3.82},{"area":"graphics","rank":37,"score":4.09},{"area":"audio","rank":57,"score":3.47},{"area":"innovation","rank":63,"score":3.28},{"area":"mood","rank":79,"score":3.11},{"area":"theme","rank":105,"score":2.94},{"area":"humor","rank":122,"score":2.33},{"area":"coolness","rank":719,"score":40}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Death Cell","category":"compo","description":"Death Cell, a Cellular Automata/Game of Life-based Shoot 'Em Up by @fohx.\n\nLeft/Right arrow keys to move, space to shoot.

This seemingly \nunwieldy nano-bot can do your every bidding after a few rounds of calibration, through some process the box \n(yes, a very tiny box indeed) calls \"Random Mutation!\" After a few rounds though, you begin to question whether or \nnot the controls are really evolving to you liking... \n\n//// \n\nTIRED OF RANDOM CONTROLS? \n\nWell, you are in luck, the E-Motion Inc. tech support crew just offered a firmware update, just for you complainers! \nIt gets rid of all that mutation jumbo and allows a simple WASD and SPACE BAR interface. \n\nJust drag \"GameplayState.class\" into your bin folder. Backup the old \"GameplayState.class\" if you ever want to go back.\n\n//// \n\nRUNNING THE GAME\n\n* I do believe if your screen cannot support the resolution of the game (1250x800), you will still see some of the game cut off, \nbut it may actually run alright now due to a fix, try moving the LDGame.class into the bin folder. That may allow you to\nplay the game (1250x750), but if your character still flys off the screen, please don't downrate.\n\n\n\nTo Run The Game:\n\nExtract and make sure folder containing bin and data and the other folders is named exactly \"LD24\" \n\nWindows: Double click run.bat\n\nFor other OS or if its still not working in Windows:\n\nRun the following console command when you are inside your games directory:\n\njavaw.exe -Djava.library.path=%CD%\\lib;%CD%\\lib;%CD%\\lib -classpath %CD%\\bin;%CD%\\lib\\slick.jar;%CD%\\lib\\lwjgl.jar LDGame\n \nIf its still not working it may be because you are using an old version of javaw.exe for some reason, despite the fact you\nmay have the latest jave installed. Try running a command like one of these instead (would be different for other OS, just find javaw.exe for your OS in a jre7, or java 1.7 kind of folder):\n\nFor x86 java install on 64 bit machine (Most likely): \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre7\\bin\\javaw.exe\" -Djava.library.path=%CD%\\lib;%CD%\\lib;%CD%\\lib -classpath %CD%\\bin;%CD%\\lib\\slick.jar;%CD%\\lib\\lwjgl.jar LDGame\n\nFor x64 java install or x86 intstall on 32 bit machine (Most likely): \"C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre7\\bin\\javaw.exe\" -Djava.library.path=%CD%\\lib;%CD%\\lib;%CD%\\lib -classpath %CD%\\bin;%CD%\\lib\\slick.jar;%CD%\\lib\\lwjgl.jar LDGame\n\n//// \n\nNotes: \n\nYou may notice that some features did not get implemented. Originally, you would get a best score with an \niteration, and then try and beat that score with the next iteration. \n\nThen the iteration you did the best with would play a bonus round, and get saved in the High Score list. These \ncontrol configurations that made it to the High Score would be reloadable at the player's will. \n\nTo do a little bit of that now, you have to relaunch the game itself. Annoying, but I sadly ran out of time to \nimplement those features, although I was quite close. \n\nI also have only tested on Windows. Mac and Windows peeps, let me know how its going!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/f540f285ea96f7370cb27e701a1de5e3.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=7245","author":{"name":"jsjwooowooo","uid":7245,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0b40e0ae75670b9ea2529744d5f047b2?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/jsjwooowooo/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7245-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7245-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7245-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7245-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7245-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7245-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7245-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7245-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7245-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7245-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/122720/LD24.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/122720/LD24.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/122720/LD24.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/122720/E-Motional%20Progression%20Source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":932,"score":26}],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"EvoProbe","category":"compo","description":"A simple puzzle game where you should control an EvoProbe - a special device made by Creturian race. \n\nEvoProbe lands on a planet and starts a process of controlled evolution from spores it carried aboard.

Still the same game code as the compo version, so featuring all your favourite bugs, but more visible on laptops etc.\n\nCurrent Known Bugs:\n- No top speed when in car mode\n- Player speed not reset to 0 at start of new sheet\n- 'Free movement' doesn't shoot in last moved direction\n- 'Random' enemies are always the same (static)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/cf5ee421c849b0808135ee3651c9d954.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=15980","author":{"name":"CdrJameson","uid":15980,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bd69017f876b776020cee1ae74197c23?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/cdrjameson/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15980-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15980-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15980-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15980-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15980-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15980-shot2.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15980-shot3.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15980-shot3.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (1280x960)","url":"http://www.mostlyharmless.co.uk/LudumDare/OntologyRecapitulatesPhylology/V5/MonkeyGame.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.mostlyharmless.co.uk/LudumDare/OntologyRecapitulatesPhylology/V5/Ontology1.monkey"},{"label":"Web (960x720)","url":"http://www.mostlyharmless.co.uk/LudumDare/OntologyRecapitulatesPhylology/PostCompoV6/MonkeyGame960x720.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":31,"score":3.88},{"area":"theme","rank":75,"score":3.75},{"area":"overall","rank":623,"score":2.47},{"area":"fun","rank":689,"score":1.94},{"area":"graphics","rank":736,"score":1.69},{"area":"coolness","rank":832,"score":33}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Hey, Little Amoeba!","category":"compo","description":"In this game you control a cluster of green spheres that supposedly represent an Amoeba, and run around picking up green food boxes while avoiding the red poison boxes (which will kill off one of your spheres).\n\nNo win or lose conditions, but still pretty happy with what I was able to accomplish over the 48hrs, considering I was building an engine at the same time as making the game.\n\nSpeaking of, new engine features added over 48hrs:\n\nBasic GUI with text labels and buttons, spring force driven network graph, scene graphs, mouse input interactions, sprite sheets, tile maps, sprite animations, and more... productive days!\n\nCode available at github: https://github.com/decultured/ludum_dare_24_evolution\n\nEngine at:\nhttps://github.com/decultured/glomp-engine/","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/94f89010f4531244393f7c7555393815.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=11438","author":{"name":"decultured","uid":11438,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2936ae5f9cc0c3393b51f5e0de8c3515?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/decultured/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11438-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11438-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11438-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11438-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://vivaresolution.com/glOMP.app.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1171,"score":0}],"platforms":["mac","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Land of Piiu","category":"jam","description":"Play the small Piiu and help him to grow up.

It's about the main character's 16th birthday. He's a cell and birthdays are when cells evolve.\n\nI hit some technical snags with this one: My initial idea to use Photoshop and Flash and a map of 16,000 x 16,000 pixels caused me all sorts of headaches. Who'da thunk it? I succeeded at about 10,000 pixels square, but this ate out of my time I had hoped to spend making massive content. So the map is a little empty or MS-Painty in places and the game is silent except for the Tom 7 Special Title Screen Theme Song. But there is lots to do and I even just played through the whole game and it is winnable and I don't think you can even get stuck. You'll definitely learn a lot of accurate science on the way.\n\nhttp://evolution.spacebar.org/compo.shtml\n\nHints, in increasing spoiler order:\n - I had also planned on a built-in map system, since the thing is pretty huge. The second screenshot is the map. Use it if you like.\n - If you're stuck after talking to the scientist, there's nothing else down there. You can get back out with a few well-timed rave jumps. This is the hardest part; take a look at the map.\n - First visit Gene, the shellfish.\n - The mine is flooded, to non-swimmers.\n - With new powers, tree climbing is indicated. No reason to take the long way from above.\n - The scientist detector is fooled by labcoats. That floaty thing is the way back out.\n - You can win up in space. Aren't you curious?\n - Everything else is just icing. Maybe I'll add some more trasures in the crannies for the jam.\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c97bb0845b3790ef588770d8e57ca7c0.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=1984","author":{"name":"Tom 7","uid":1984,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6b5688ba98c8e3bdbe1e24781110459e?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/brighterorange/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1984-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1984-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1984-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1984-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1984-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1984-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1984-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1984-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1984-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/1984-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://evolution.spacebar.org/compo.shtml"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://tom7misc.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/tom7misc/trunk/evolution/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1013,"score":20}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Paprika Blue","category":"jam","description":"Enthropy\n\nA very awesome engine/editor made in c++/sfml/box2d, by Eugene Paik.

Candy Hill, and you control  a little ball. As you collect various candy you get bigger (you \"evolve\"), but you are also constantly shrinking, so keep collecting the candy to keep going. You also should be wary to not let the ball get too big, as you will lose if you get to a certain size. (It will say \"Warning!\" if you're close to losing) You also lose if you let the ball get too small, too, of course. ;)\n\nAll in all, I'm happy I participated in LD24. Learned a bit, had a lot of fun, didn't sleep (xD), and came out alive with a pretty good little game. Could be much better, yes. Rushed, yes. I will keep working on it and release an enhanced version sooner or later. \n\nEnjoy, hope you all enjoyed LD24.\n\nControls:\nMove: Left/Right Arrows\nJump: Space/Up\nGoal: Collect candy to let the ball get larger, don't let it get too big and of course, not too small or you lose. Also, don't collect the evil tomatoes or the ball's size will decrease quite a bit.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/53bfc8fbff44a0d82c26c43d73851564.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=7354","author":{"name":"CaptainIcy","uid":7354,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/661c17772e9f934610f8c0c4abfa1cef?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/captainicy/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7354-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7354-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7354-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/7354-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51004934/LD24/Windows.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51004934/LD24/WebPlayer.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51004934/LD24/LD24candyhillsrc.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":52},{"area":"humor","rank":150,"score":2.86},{"area":"fun","rank":215,"score":3.1},{"area":"audio","rank":221,"score":2.83},{"area":"mood","rank":235,"score":2.92},{"area":"graphics","rank":291,"score":3.13},{"area":"overall","rank":432,"score":2.87},{"area":"innovation","rank":536,"score":2.47},{"area":"theme","rank":628,"score":2.17}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Complexitivity","category":"jam","description":"Intruder alert!

To evolve the kind you want, you'll have to remove Poggles with undesired traits from the gene pool. Achieve success by strategically killing off sections of the population via climate change and sniping individuals with lightning bolts!\n\nThere are further instructions in the game. For the best experience, please use an up-to-date browser like Firefox or Chrome.\n\nTips:\n- The features of a new Poggle are chosen randomly from its parents. Identify which Poggles could have the baby that you want, then try to get them together.\n- Colors don't mix: red and blue Poggles have either red or blue babies, not purple.\n- Don't be afraid to control the population by wiping out whole sections with climate change.\n\nKnown bugs: The lightning doesn't reach to the bottom of the screen.

Each round, the enemies that appear are mutations of those enemies that dealt the most damage to you on the previous round.\n\nYou can steer the direction of the enemies' evolution by taking more damage from the ones you like. It might not be easy to see that it's working, because of the game's difficulty. Therefore you can start a game in easy mode by pressing Ctrl-Alt-R when the game is paused. In this mode you can for example try to cause the enemies to become a particular colour.\n\nThe game has been found to run OK on a netbook with Ion graphics. It requires the .Net and XNA redistributables (the \"installer\" version of the game should be able to download them).\n\nThanks go to Brian Corr for moral and technical camaraderie.

The progression and challenge aren't as broken now, but I'm afraid the gameplay is beyond saving without strong rule changes, a disadvantage of being designed in about an hour.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b9fea6cc0a6e495c04aafa8d2961488f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=15691","author":{"name":"Prealpha","uid":15691,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9ecad5a5e7194cf966f325ed7b4f99aa?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/prealpha/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15691-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15691-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15691-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15691-shot1.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/101140435/dna_soup_windows.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/101140435/dna_soup.love"},{"label":"Post-compo Windows","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/101140435/DNA_Soup_post.zip"},{"label":"Post-compo source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/101140435/DNA_Soup_post.love"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":71},{"area":"innovation","rank":98,"score":3.56},{"area":"fun","rank":169,"score":3.21},{"area":"theme","rank":171,"score":3.44},{"area":"overall","rank":270,"score":3.15},{"area":"mood","rank":364,"score":2.65},{"area":"graphics","rank":548,"score":2.44},{"area":"humor","rank":570,"score":1.48},{"area":"audio","rank":576,"score":1.36}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Evolution Through Alchemy","category":"compo","description":"Yay my first ludum dare entry!

Unfortunately, that was too many robots and we never quite realized our goal of actually making a win/lose condition or progression on the character's side.  So what we have left is more of a toy than a game; more of a preview of our generated robots.   We have art for about 9 times as many chassis as you can see in the game, in addition to a large number of traps and things the robots could do to counter the traps.  All the artwork was originally produced since the beginning of the jam.\n\nThe game would have worked as such:  You are an employee in a lab who's robots suddenly go haywire, forcing you to protect various important assets.  You can place barricades and traps, but the robots are varied and diverse, and among their ranks are robots built perfectly to compromise your defenses.  The better the individual robots do, the more likely their GONADS (galvanized ontogenetic nanobot assembled deployment systems) are to transmit their own designs back to the manufactury, guaranteeing more similar robots.  The goal of the player, therefore, is to misdirect this reaction.  Build walls and walls of wood until every robot carries a saw and an axe, then switch to metal bars and sprinkler traps and watch as they fall against your defenses... until the one nerdy robot carrying an umbrella and an arc welder makes it to the front of the pack, impressing all of the lady robots,* spreading his seed far and wide.\n\nThis is more of a general proof of concept for the pathfinding that that game would use.  You can place blocks from the panel in the upper left that add to the 'cost' of the path based on the hardness of the block (wood<stone<metal), and robots will re-path mid route, even to other goals.\n\nWe (just two of us) do plan on fleshing out this concept in the coming weeks.  Check out http://madleedesign.com/ for updates as we release a finished version in the next month.\n\n*(There are not actually lady robots)  ","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/415473e2de27907c7deb9f1b00bd72be.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=15236","author":{"name":"madlee","uid":15236,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/159906c471e93641c70edec686226ebc?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/madlee/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15236-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15236-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15236-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15236-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15236-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15236-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15236-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15236-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://merc-arch.com/GONADS/ui/base.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1013,"score":20}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Goo","category":"compo","description":"Note: This is my first LD\n\nIn post-compo i just fixed the text at intro by changing background(i plan on adding more content though).

It fits into the theme of evolution in a way that I hope is different to other games in that it is the player that must evolve and not elements in the game. There is a very steep learning curve to playing this game. Not much help is given during play and the player is expected to work a lot of it out on their own, thus evolving. As keys used are similar to vim, it can also help the player to use vim better by creating muscle memory. JS/Linux and 32-bit binaries may not work perfectly. They have not been tested as much as the 64-bit version. If you want to compile the source yourself, you'll need to have the development files for ncurses and gcc. Important keys are: h,j,k,l to move, y to pick things up,  p to drop things or place them, b to see notepad, q to quit, o for OK and i for ordering supplies.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/edb34ae48f82bcbc7197552b0d6f663e.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=8784","author":{"name":"irl","uid":8784,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7e6e504ede43a10fc728698002e1d9cf?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/irl/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8784-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8784-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8784-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8784-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/irl/la-cucina"},{"label":"Linux (64-bit)","url":"https://github.com/downloads/irl/la-cucina/la-cucina-linux64.tar.gz"},{"label":"Linux (32-bit)","url":"https://github.com/downloads/irl/la-cucina/la-cucina-linux32.tar.gz"},{"label":"JS/Linux","url":"https://gist.github.com/3474363"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1040,"score":17}],"platforms":["linux","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Life Forms","category":"compo","description":"Every life form is made from cells, You are a life form too.\nCollect DNA so you can buy new cells and improve your life form!\n Each cell have different power:\n Body cell - Increase your you maximum health - Costs 10 DNA.\n Speed cell - Improve your speed - Costs 20 DNA.\n Defense cell - Improve your defense - Costs 30 DNA.\n Attack cell - Improve your attack power - Costs 30 DNA.\n Health cell - Improve your health regeneration - Costs 30 DNA.\n \nThere are other life forms too, when you kill them you get their DNA.\n \nOnce you have enough DNA you can enter the editor by clicking on the \"Store\" button and buy new cells.\n \nMade by Galman33 for Ludum Dare #24 in 48 hours.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/6e6d54a7644c56864cc33fc328001dc0.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=5971","author":{"name":"galman","uid":5971,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ca2d7ef03427835caf0e645e9dcec63a?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/galman/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5971-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5971-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5971-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5971-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5971-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5971-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5971-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5971-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.kongregate.com/games/galman33/life-forms/"},{"label":"Live Stream","url":"http://www.twitch.tv/galman33"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6AzHy6AnMQ"},{"label":"Post Mortem","url":"http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/09/01/life-forms-the-post-mortem/"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/42020614/Ludum%20Dare/LudumDare24/LD24.rar"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":53},{"area":"audio","rank":46,"score":3.61},{"area":"mood","rank":79,"score":3.43},{"area":"theme","rank":90,"score":3.69},{"area":"fun","rank":134,"score":3.32},{"area":"overall","rank":222,"score":3.25},{"area":"innovation","rank":296,"score":3.04},{"area":"humor","rank":419,"score":1.93},{"area":"graphics","rank":556,"score":2.41}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Paradigm Shift","category":"compo","description":"Hey there!\nPhew!

They all do different things when you push any of the buttons from A to Z. (Or combinations of buttons) If you get slimes to the flag, then your new slimes will be descended from them. To finish the later, more difficult levels, you need to play the earlier levels with the goal of training certain keys to do the moves you'll need for the difficult levels.

It's essentially a post compo version, or a jam version whichever you prefer to call it.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/5de1c7a83d55afe24ae81725a90bf35f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=5432","author":{"name":"Andrew","uid":5432,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/548dd261a9eb1458e4d64cd7cd0549e1?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/andrew-2/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5432-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5432-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5432-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5432-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5432-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/5432-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (unity)","url":"http://software.o-o.ro/ld24/index.html"},{"label":"Kongregate version","url":"http://www.kongregate.com/games/Sqloud/the-evolution-games-unnatural-selection"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/550111/ld24/ld24.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":85},{"area":"humor","rank":135,"score":2.93},{"area":"graphics","rank":388,"score":2.88},{"area":"mood","rank":392,"score":2.6},{"area":"audio","rank":394,"score":2.34},{"area":"fun","rank":563,"score":2.37},{"area":"overall","rank":577,"score":2.59},{"area":"theme","rank":625,"score":2.18},{"area":"innovation","rank":696,"score":1.98}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"The Evolution Of The BlobFish","category":"compo","description":"FOR THIS GAME YOU NEED NET FRAMEWORK 4 : http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851\n\nif you have any problems running this game. try donwloading this file: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914\n\nThis is a game based on the first stage in Spore.\nYou are a little blobfish that wants to evolve to a sharklike fish.\n\n\nIn order to reach that goal, You need to eat other fishies, and run away from the bad fishies.

A central online server is used to breed together the most difficult levels and propagate them to other, future players.\n\nThere is no win condition. The purpose of this game is not to be won. The purpose of this game is to get progressively better at killing you.\n\nNOTE: Because the levels of this game are born in the cloud, this game will necessarily continue to change after the 48 hour Ludum Dare period completes. I fully intend to continue tinkering with and improving the breeding pool on the server after the 48 hour period.\nNOTE 2: I did not test this at ALL before submitting.\n\nUPDATE: This game was edited after the 48-hour period to fix a game-breaking bug (a big, critical chunk of data that was being collected was not being sent to the server) and to add a missing license disclosure. Nothing else was changed. The Windows and Linux versions were added after the 48-hour deadline and also incorporate these changes.

They can reproduce a lot and that causes a mutation on their attributes, creating a natural selection of your minions.Some have special powers, like flying (or having loads of HP)\n\nThe game objective is to carry the purple crystals (one by one) to the altar.\n\nStill a lot of unexpected behaviors my happen in the game, and the game is very easy.

Your goal is to cultivate plants that survive longer than 5 minutes in a hazardous environment. Plants get pollinated by fireflys. Plants have a genetically coded resistance agains the environmental effects that surround them (heat, cold, rain). Try to kill all those fireflies that bring pollen that you don't want to have in your plants genetic code. Recombine those resistances that you want selectively to survive the dynamicly changing weather.\n\n\nTUTORIAL: There is an ingame tutorial that I added in the last second. It is not very intuitively written (although it does explain everything needed to play the game). I wrote an offline-tutorial that should explain much better. Of course you can also just start the game, but don't complain about not understanding what is going on afterwards please :) \nSo here is the tutorial: http://timtips.com/ld24/tutorial/\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdded android version. You can get it from google play by using the above link, using a QR-Scanner to scan the 2d bar code that is one of the screenshots attached further down this page (leads to google play too) or download the apk directly here: http://www.timtips.com/downloads/Firefly.apk. Not tested on smaller displays (eg. 480x320). Larger displays (up to 10\" tablet size) should work.\n\nThe only control change is that you can swap between plant spots with a fling/pan gesture and instead of right clicking things, you can make a long press (keeping your finger on the same position for about a second).\n\n28.08.2012 Few people are still experiencing problems to start the game. Some thoughts: \n\n* Please let the game load, I didn't have the time to add a loading screen. It may take a couple of seconds until the black screen dissapears and the game starts. \n\n* If the applet version doesn't work for you, try the jar please. On windows double-click on it should be enough to start it. On linux just start it from console with java -jar filename.jar\n\n* If none of it is working, please consider sending me a stack trace to [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */ or to leave a more detailed description in your comment. I would really like to make this game playable for everyone. Thanks :)\n\n* One user (Thurig) told me that only after disabling jar/zip-scanning in his antivirus software he was able to play the game. Be assured, its not because there is a virus in it :) So if you like, you may try that too.\n\n27.08.2012 EDIT: Fixed a bug that causes the game to crash on many windows PCs.

In this game you guide a colony of bacteria (initially red [and created as a Brownian tree]) down a tunnel, trying to minimize collisions with the walls (blue) and obstacles (yellow). As you progress, you will unavoidably run into something. When a collision happens, the section of your colony that collided dies, while surviving bacterium mutate and replicate, creating new members. As you continue, the shape of your colony evolves, sometimes helping you avoid obstacles (an advantageous mutation), sometimes making them unavoidable (deleterious mutation).\n\nThe title of the window tells you how many collisions you've had. The right most number in for the current session. The previous numbers are for previous sessions. A \"*\" denotes that the session wasn't finished.\n\nControls:\nArrow keys move\nSpace starts and resets\nEscape exits\n\nResources:\nI used Java, LWJGL, Slick-Util, Eclipse, and Audacity for this project.\nI started with this base code: http://lwjgl.org/wiki/index.php?title=LWJGL_Basics_3_(The_Quad)\nI used some code from here for sound:\nhttp://lwjgl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Slick-Util_Library_-_Part_2_-_Loading_Sounds_for_LWJGL\nI also reused an old drawCube() method I had written a while ago.\nIf any of this isn't kosher please let me know.\n\nInstructions:\nDownload/unzip/run Cocci.jar in the folder it's in\n\nNotes:\nI ran the gamut of emotions while making this, from caffeine induced glee to frustration and anxiety that the whole thing would end up terrible. Overall, although it's a bit janky, I'm really happy with how it ended up. Also, save yourself the headache and me the embarrassment and don't look at the source code, it's a tangled horrible mess.

I loved working with it, it was my first time and I think its a great tool.\n\nMy source is on github, I included the link.\n\nAll comments are welcome!\n\nNOTE: This is a WEBGL/HTML5 game. It is best played in the newest chrome and barring that the newest Firefox. Some of the effects will not show up in IE and it may run slowly if your browser hasn't been restarted in a while.\n\nNOTE 2: The controls for the final round are: Arrow keys move you around, you auto aim towards the mouse cursor, HOLD the left mouse button to fire. Right mouse button will fire the breakout ball but you can only have one in play at a time. Running into it will pick it up again and you can then reshoot it.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/54048c51317d933887b346f5be51b4f9.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=11378","author":{"name":"Lacutis","uid":11378,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7cfb21e44ea467da0d4fb22c2f3251fe?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/lacutis/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11378-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11378-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11378-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11378-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11378-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11378-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11378-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/11378-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5/WebGL","url":"http://www.unimatrix01.org/ludum24/"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/wrroper/Gameage"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":301,"score":3.08},{"area":"humor","rank":396,"score":2},{"area":"audio","rank":454,"score":2.17},{"area":"mood","rank":481,"score":2.42},{"area":"fun","rank":503,"score":2.54},{"area":"graphics","rank":553,"score":2.42},{"area":"innovation","rank":575,"score":2.36},{"area":"overall","rank":611,"score":2.5},{"area":"coolness","rank":641,"score":45}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Hero's Evolution","category":"compo","description":"My most complete ludum dare entry yet! \nIf you are wondering about how it fits into the theme, I thought the evolution of character would work, as I didn't feel like making a more literal themed game.\nPress \"M\" to mute the game if you so desire.\n\nWARNING!

We would like to present you our second game created for Ludum Dare Jam. Powered by Crafty, it is smooth to play and easy to enjoy ;-) Darwin is watching you.\n\nInstructions:\nTo win you have to hide your white player. To do so, move it to a place in between four tiles that matches with the pattern your player consists of. If this place is not arranged yet, you can pass items to slide the traces and modify patterns. When an enemy has found its place time runs out faster. Before the round ends, make sure your pattern matches at least with two or three tiles you are placed on. After each round Darwinci eleminates one of the least hidden players. Get through the four rounds to win the game.\n\nHave fun and post your comments!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/4367da06aaab002032165d5c4a9088e3.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=15017","author":{"name":"wlad","uid":15017,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6d1854791e9dec2b9d80a4b0d4f5165b?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/wlad/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15017-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15017-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/wgusew/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/wgusew/src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":71},{"area":"innovation","rank":12,"score":3.89},{"area":"graphics","rank":76,"score":3.72},{"area":"audio","rank":82,"score":3.22},{"area":"overall","rank":90,"score":3.28},{"area":"fun","rank":119,"score":2.94},{"area":"mood","rank":137,"score":2.72},{"area":"humor","rank":155,"score":2.04},{"area":"theme","rank":166,"score":2.49}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Age runners","category":"compo","description":"","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c4b306a1667840645efea3d2c347bf36.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14374","author":{"name":"balauru","uid":14374,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/93f1354c83415286e6774a4e61fdde03?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/balauru/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14374-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14374-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/46062762/Age%20runners.rar"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/46062762/Age%20runners%20-%20source.rar"}],"ratings":[{"area":"audio","rank":205,"score":2.89},{"area":"humor","rank":337,"score":2.14},{"area":"graphics","rank":363,"score":2.95},{"area":"fun","rank":421,"score":2.7},{"area":"overall","rank":442,"score":2.85},{"area":"mood","rank":488,"score":2.41},{"area":"theme","rank":494,"score":2.58},{"area":"coolness","rank":601,"score":47},{"area":"innovation","rank":676,"score":2.05}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Combine And Conquer","category":"compo","description":"In this game, your aim is to survive through five rounds of natural selection.

This is my first time participating in a LD, and I'm happy to have finished.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/0bf2527991d5791e2344fb8f9b4aac7e.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14357","author":{"name":"zatyka","uid":14357,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/71277e4c10b62928325ab7a206aacadf?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/zatyka/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14357-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14357-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14357-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14357-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14357-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14357-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14357-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14357-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://zkatz.com/games/LD24"},{"label":"Video Walkthrough","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWYW_xQz0Sg"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4756521/LD24/Source.capx"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"humor","rank":120,"score":3},{"area":"mood","rank":129,"score":3.16},{"area":"audio","rank":178,"score":2.98},{"area":"overall","rank":246,"score":3.2},{"area":"fun","rank":275,"score":2.98},{"area":"graphics","rank":379,"score":2.92},{"area":"innovation","rank":465,"score":2.62},{"area":"theme","rank":540,"score":2.45}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Planets","category":"compo","description":"Hi there,\nThis is my first time in this contest.

I am Rubicon and I thought that I would try Ludum Dare 24! I am really new to making games and do not know that much. But while I was trying to make a game I learned a lot so I am not walking away empty handed.... I still have a lot to learn though.. and the game is not an executable or anything it is just the Eclipse code files. There are things in the code that i could not figure out. But I thought that since I put in the work, I might as well share what I have accomplished :) I hope that I can participate in the next Ludum Dare and actually get a complete game out for you all to enjoy. I will continue to try and learn! Thanks for stopping by!\n\n**Edit** Thanks to Cthulhu I fixed the enemies not following the path after level 3 and Towers can not be placed on the path now. Also there is a Game.jar file in the file that will run the game.

You can now move at any time, a lot of strange events due to speed incoherence have been fixed.\n\nSince there is sound, you can activate/deactivate it with the \"m\" key, and WASD control are now available","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/76e1afc6c5a594f262cd00bced8d02eb.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=3984","author":{"name":"Colapsydo","uid":3984,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b7b0ef15e8009e05c08fc8dbd8c89ed4?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/colapsydo/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/3984-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/3984-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/3984-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/3984-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/3984-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/3984-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://digilander.libero.it/Colapsydo/games/ld48/ld24/LD24.html"},{"label":"Web (Post Compo)","url":"http://digilander.libero.it/Colapsydo/games/ld48/ld24/LD24-PostCompo.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/49521293/LD48/LD24/Sources%20Ulovetion.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"theme","rank":96,"score":3.68},{"area":"innovation","rank":183,"score":3.28},{"area":"humor","rank":456,"score":1.85},{"area":"overall","rank":512,"score":2.72},{"area":"mood","rank":523,"score":2.33},{"area":"graphics","rank":530,"score":2.48},{"area":"fun","rank":563,"score":2.37},{"area":"audio","rank":581,"score":1.32}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Unlikely Companion","category":"compo","description":"First LD!

Congratulations to everyone who participated in Ludum Dare!\n\nRegards, \n\nWanderlands","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/2310cb84825a42d1054253e19ea764b6.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=8643","author":{"name":"Wanderlands","uid":8643,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2f96388aabc3585757188428964c6e39?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/harrylee/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8643-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8643-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8643-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8643-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8643-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/8643-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://wanderlands.org/icarus.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1171,"score":0}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Move forward","category":"compo","description":"Firstborn is looking into way to evolve.

Also, my first heart attack. You see, I was in the middle of the development of a clever, smart, smooth comedy puzzle. However, like all good things that happen to me, I encountered a problem with it and therefore gave up on it and tucked it away in a dark corner where I was sure to never see it again. Meaning, my \"Open This Folder When I get a Girlfriend\" folder.\n\nAnyway, second of all, the INSTRUCTIONS and DEDICATED TO NEIL ARMSTRONG text files are blank. That is because I realized I forgot to fill them out after I had already compressed, uploaded, and shared my game link, and am too much of a lazy bum to update it. So I will just write those here.\nSUMMARY-\n-This is a local multiplayer game where the 2 players control a blue single-celled organism, and a red single-celled organism. The objective of the game is to collect 10 black cells, which will randomly appear at random locations on the screen. The first organism to collect 10 cells will evolve straight to the age of Space Flight. My innovative Indie game element is that if the 2 cells touch each other (bow chicka bow wow), they BOTH will lose ALL their cells. By \"touch each other\" I mean fully overlap one another- one organism can go halfway through another, for example. This gives a nice twist to the gameplay where one has to avoid the other player while trying to race them to the same spot. This can lead to some very Scooby-Doo chase scenes.\n-To move, the players mash their WASD or arrow buttons, depending on the player. The faster they mash the buttons, the faster they will go and the more they will complain and not play this game anymore.\n-An announcer, who I like to call \"Very Low Budget Crappy GLaDOS\", will announce things at specific points of the match.\n-Though there is no distinct Multiplayer or Singleplayer mode, if you have no one else to play with, try to keep the balls as close together as possible and to follow the black ball. Make sure that the balls are touching(without one fully overlapping the other so your score doesn't get reset), while still maintaining a speed to follow the black ball with. If the organisms overlap or disconnect, you lose.  Ambidextrous players will have quite the advantage.\nINSTRUCTIONS-\nPlayer One(Blue/Smurf)-\nW-Up\nA-Left\nS-Down\nD-Right\nPlayer Two(Red/Commie)-\nWell, the arrow keys.. You know.\n\n\n\nLastly, I would like to dedicate this game to Neil Armstrong. I find it tragic that the theme was Evolution, and man who helped in the evolution of science and technology so much as Neil Armstrong passed away. Rest in peace. You were the very first to leave this world, and you do it now once again. Safe travels, Commander.\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d422ba468b0e332aa6ee35a939245821.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14314","author":{"name":"thetyk1337","uid":14314,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bd5f63aadbaedd8fac28bda7256b5121?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/thetyk1337/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14314-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14314-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14314-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14314-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"All Operating Systems(Source)","url":"http://www.4shared.com/zip/twJ3obs5/Praegressus_Bellum.html?"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1112,"score":10}],"platforms":["desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Probes of fury","category":"compo","description":"First time entry, didn't go as expected, but i at least got something running.\n\nControls are \nWSAD or left gamepad stick for movement\nQE or right gamepad stick turns the probe\nSpacebar or R1 fires the weapon\n\nESC quits the game","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/715e95ac7cf6b2718830d6d489c6d978.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=15513","author":{"name":"zeoverlord","uid":15513,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/62533597a69a8276322ae164c5404803?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/zeoverlord/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15513-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15513-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://flashbang.se/download/probes_of_fury.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://flashbang.se/download/probes_of_fury_source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1171,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Save The Memepool","category":"compo","description":"A game where you help Richard Dawkins restore society's long lost cultural genes.

The game's \"gimmick\" (and the connection to the theme) is that the control scheme gets significantly more complex as you get further and players have to adapt to the new controls. This gimmick doesn't really show itself until maybe stage 8 or 10 or so, and the stages are rather difficult due to hastily done level design, so for most people it will just seem like a generic platformer that has nothing to do with the theme. And even for players who got to the later stages, the connection to the theme probably wouldn't have been obvious without this explanation. So I expect low marks for \"Theme\", but I had fun making the game.\n\nAbout the two download links: I noticed a stupid bug right after the submission deadline passed, so I fixed it. The bug was easy to fix but fairly serious (the \"infinite\" lives on some difficulty settings were not actually infinite) so I think it's okay to rate the late version.

Once a flower has been buried, it must be watered to reach its full maturity. Watering requires energy, which you can get by harvesting kinetic energy from mature flowers (using the shears). Be careful not to over-harvest, or you will kill the plants!\n\nTo get more seeds, you must use the cotton swab to mix the pollen of two flowers. Select the swab tool and two flowers and hit space to generate seeds. This also requires energy.\n\nIf you don't have enough energy to continue your garden you can press [r] to restart.\n\nBe cautious while moving plants, if they are stressed too much (spinning, immature, recently bred) they may not survive.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/1c9d0946901fa7a4b60d4e44fc7a3925.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=15443","author":{"name":"sclark39","uid":15443,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/45de5ef58f16a17b5f1ad2bf89b01445?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/sclark39/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15443-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15443-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15443-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15443-shot1.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15443-shot2.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15443-shot2.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15443-shot3.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/15443-shot3.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://skylerclark.com/a/ld24/"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://youtu.be/XzZwZ-JIf0U"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://skylerclark.com/a/ld24/AscensionGarden.7z"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":65},{"area":"innovation","rank":208,"score":3.21},{"area":"theme","rank":260,"score":3.18},{"area":"overall","rank":442,"score":2.85},{"area":"graphics","rank":502,"score":2.56},{"area":"audio","rank":540,"score":1.75},{"area":"humor","rank":570,"score":1.48},{"area":"mood","rank":590,"score":2.19},{"area":"fun","rank":619,"score":2.21}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"being a Vampire Is Not Very Fun","category":"compo","description":"It's not an easy life for a vampire these days....\n\nbeing a Vampire Is Not Very Fun at all.

Requires Java 7\n\nControls: Arrow Keys - Move, Z - Attack, X - Absorb. \n\nThis is an arcade style survival game. The goal is to stay alive as long as possible.\n\nTribes of ink soldiers are fighting for control of a piece of paper. Each tribe has genetic traits that dictate its base attack power, defense power, speed, regeneration rate, and upgrade rate. So some tribes are innately better than others. \n\nYou are an ink soldier like any other, with one additional ability. You have the ability to absorb the ink dropped from fallen ink soldiers around you. To do so, be over the corpse of a slain ink soldier and hold X. This ink makes up your gene pool, which is shown as a bar at the bottom of the screen. Each tribe has its own unique color of ink, and your gene pool is comprised of the colors of ink you have absorbed. The dominant color in your gene pool dictates what your genetic traits are, so you can join different tribes by absorbing the ink of their fallen soldiers.\n\nInk soldiers come in four classes:\nEach soldier class can upgrade into the next one by killing enemies or being near\nallies killing enemies.\nSpear - These are the basic soldiers, and have a thrusting attack.\nSword - Melee soldiers with a cleaving sword slash attack.\nBow - Ranged soldiers that can shoot arrows from a distance.\nCannon - The ultimate soldier. Has a powerful ink cannonball attack.\n\nThe only goal of this game is to stay alive for as long as possible. The score is the number of seconds you've stayed alive. New tribes get stronger over time, so you will eventually need to switch tribes in order to be on par with other soldiers. Whenever you manage to switch tribes, you will lose all of your class upgrades, and your absorption power will also become less effective.\n\nTips:\n- Ink soldiers in your current tribe will be striped to make them stand out more.\n- Try to observe tribes fighting each other to figure out who the stronger tribes are. \n- Stick with your tribe to stay safe, but be ready to convert into a genetically superior tribe in case your current one becomes overwhelmed! You will want to upgrade into the cannon soldier as quickly as possible to have a fighting chance against stronger tribes. \n- Tribes will roam the map randomly. Try to avoid getting mobbed by really fast enemies.\n- The more of your gene pool is comprised of the dominant color, the stronger your attack multiplier will be. Absorbing ink from fallen allies is a safe way to increase your damage.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d38cf5e79895a94eceab9ca8f3c94f12.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14556","author":{"name":"Cixelyn","uid":14556,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8724e6883365049009fac108e247a623?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/cixelyn/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14556-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14556-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://coryli.scripts.mit.edu/ld48/mina-bin.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://coryli.scripts.mit.edu/ld48/mina-bin.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://coryli.scripts.mit.edu/ld48/mina-bin.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://bitbucket.org/esports/mina"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1171,"score":0}],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Natural Selection: breeding by God","category":"compo","description":"You are a God.

This happens in some computers, but it doesn't happen in other computers. This is an issue with how GameMaker handles MP3s. We should had used an external library to handle the music of the game, but as we didn't state it before, it would break the rules, and there were no time to code one from scratch.\n\nWe really only noticed that when we begun testing the game in other computers and saw it happening.\n\nIt's a real shame, since the music is actually very good IMO, when it's not cracking :/\n\nPorting the code to GameMaker Studio would probably solve the problem, but this would require some changing in the code, which I am not sure would break the rules.\n\nIf you want to skip levels, there's a cheat to do it: press enter+end at the same time. You can keep skipping levels up until you see the ending, though you will miss all the bosses of the game, which are all very cool I think :)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/4a5137a8284d87e56015d5e8829274a1.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=16030","author":{"name":"gbellgames","uid":16030,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/59e391ed20578cdcd368ae4df89b0709?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/gbellgames/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16030-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16030-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16030-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16030-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16030-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16030-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16030-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/16030-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://shatterhand.beatthegame.net/rings_of_evolution.rar"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":63},{"area":"theme","rank":138,"score":2.75},{"area":"humor","rank":140,"score":2.17},{"area":"mood","rank":153,"score":2.58},{"area":"audio","rank":156,"score":2.48},{"area":"overall","rank":161,"score":2.91},{"area":"fun","rank":168,"score":2.66},{"area":"graphics","rank":210,"score":2.5},{"area":"innovation","rank":243,"score":2.06}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Stevie Asteroid Rescues the Hovercredits","category":"compo","description":"I made this game using tools I had basically no experience with at all other than going through a few tutorials.

I'm hoping that the effect this creates is interesting to others. I'm most happy with the animations and some of the drawings, because I'm not graphically inclined and this is not something I've really ever done.\n\nUses XNA and .Net 4.0.

I couldn't figure out how to distribute the game without an installer (it just kept crashing, probably some prerequisites thing).\n\nSpecial note: you can duck under the horizontal bullets in stage 3, I suspect some people might miss that.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b067ffbb8d958d400b0156f8ddf4e451.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14228","author":{"name":"KHANanaphone","uid":14228,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1bba6e385d17ef3f7a86a65b07cc5f85?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/khananaphone/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14228-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14228-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14228-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/14228-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.dungeorama.com/Files/StevieAsteroid.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.dungeorama.com/Files/Source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":57},{"area":"theme","rank":153,"score":3.48},{"area":"humor","rank":221,"score":2.54},{"area":"audio","rank":236,"score":2.79},{"area":"fun","rank":255,"score":3},{"area":"overall","rank":375,"score":2.97},{"area":"innovation","rank":395,"score":2.79},{"area":"mood","rank":474,"score":2.43},{"area":"graphics","rank":520,"score":2.52}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Super Tree Evolution","category":"compo","description":"The source and resources can be found along with the JAR in the downloaded ZIP file.

If you kill just the weak ones, the new ants will be stronger, if you kill the strong ones the weak ants will breed.\n\nHow do the robots work?\nEach robot consist out of parts, needing at least a core (body) and one other part to survive.\nThere are two buildings, a stealmine and baracks, and two materials, steal and synthetics.\nEach robot produces synthetics - more, if he has a \"Syntheter\" - steal is produced inside a stealmine.\nYou can build a stealmine on stealdeposits (black), and baracks on grass (green) or stone (gray).\nTo create a robot you need to produces enough parts (inside a barack) and then create a robot out of it. Each robot can have at most one part of each type.\nRobots can stand still, move to a point and attack ants.\nIf a robot does not have enough energy, he can't move. To get more energy (weapons and the syntheter need much) the robot can contain a \"reactor\" or be near baracks or stealmines, because nearing to buildings there is more energy. A full robot - with a core/body, legs, reactor, syntheter and both weapontypes needs to have baracks near to have enough energy.\n\nThe ants decide themselves to idle, to move, to attack or to breed - that's the reason the game is called AInts vs Robots. Ants need no ressources.\nThe Robots have less AI, but shoot themselves when they shall attack.\n\nThe game is controlled nearly complete with the keyboard:\nArrows: Move Camera\nMouse Wheel: Zoom Camera\nW,A,S,D: move cursor (green block)\nChange module to produce: N\nBuild: B (stealmine on stealdeposit, baracks on grass/stone)\nProduce module: P (while the cursor is above baracks)\nCreate robot: R\nMove robot (to the cursor): M\nAttack ants (near the cursor): T (like \"tackle\")\nEquip robot: E (while it is in baracks)\nChange robot selection: PageUp, PageDown\n\nThe selected robot is shown at the top of the screen in the middle, at the side of it the next robots to change to with PageUp and PageDown.\nIn the lower left corner the current selected module to produce is shown, right of it all modules lying at the baracks (selected by the cursor).\n\nI have prepared four maps (which are stored as images), because of the lack of a menu a random one is chosen.\n\nFor the game I used my own little XNA frontend library (so C#, XNA and .NET).\nBecause of the lack of time (and what you can read below \"Annotation\") I was not able to release a version with Mono/MonoGame for Linux/Mac.\n\n\nAnnotation:\n\nSince I have huge performance drops since today evening (when I added breeding), I was not able to add many sounds, a menu, more animations or any music. The game may not be playable if I do not find the bug the next days and upload a new version. I have already profiled the game and removed/changed everything which needed a lot of time, but it has not become better (strange, because I did not add time intensive code before the first performance drops came). \n\nUnfortunately I did not commit the last perfectly running version to SVN, which did not had breeding (so no evolution), but was a nice RTS (with robots, ants, production and fighting).\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nIt was a lot of fun to program a whole weekend, even if I am not satisfied with the result. 48 hours are enough for a small, neat game, but not enough for a huge project, so I need to plan to do less next time. I needed a lot time to create the models, so I am going to write a blender export script for my own XML model format, because with blender I should be able to create models faster. Maybe I will use 2D graphics next time, for sure I will take some more looks at Mono and MonoGame. \n\nI hope, you (who have read the text till the end) will have fun playing the game (if that is possible - I hope I will find the bug).\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/602a02e86dde5f62b56d62172fa54aa2.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=10854","author":{"name":"YSelf Tool","uid":10854,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0b36e0c1c211fd320143b93a82242570?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/yselftool/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10854-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/10854-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?j3yey830f3tej3e"},{"label":"Windows Reach","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?cf9mfdq2mgscive"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?gy06y954gc8d0dd"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":50},{"area":"graphics","rank":312,"score":3.09},{"area":"humor","rank":473,"score":1.8},{"area":"innovation","rank":515,"score":2.52},{"area":"audio","rank":541,"score":1.73},{"area":"overall","rank":604,"score":2.52},{"area":"theme","rank":633,"score":2.15},{"area":"mood","rank":634,"score":2},{"area":"fun","rank":688,"score":1.95}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"Azyle","category":"compo","description":"== Controls:\n  W/S/A/D - Walk\n  Space   - Jump\n  Mouse 1 - Shoot\n  1/2     - Build tower (must be near a green spot)\n\n  Walk right to start the test level\n\n\nOkay so let's say this is a prototype and not a full game.\n\nI've had the idea of a tower defense + platformer combi stuck in my head for a long while so I finally decided to try it out.\n\nIt's veeeeeery basic.

I especially focused on the combat feedbacks, taking great ideas from Diablo 3 & Street Fighter 4 : slow motion, shakes, loads of particles...\n\nAnother thing I was really happy with were the character animations. You have to know : I can't draw. I mean, really. I never learned and if you ask me to draw a human face, it will look like a childish drawing of the monster under my bed. I'm just really bad at it. Digital painting is another story: I see it more like a technical thing rather than an artistic approach. The pixel grid is my friend. So, trying to animate a human character to make it look cool and powerful was really a huge challenge to me.\n\nA big problem in this Ludum Dare entry was the theme, Evolution. I first wanted to stick to something like Corporate Climber, but with combat gameplay. But the timing was too short, and making a decent beat-em-up needed lots of details and attention. So I gave up most of the \"evolution\" related ideas (climbing hierarchy and unlocking special moves). Maybe I will add them back later?","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c1ac67c6a0ddf430436626eaad4d1603.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=2982","author":{"name":"deepnight","uid":2982,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e379073d70dab2195716d99c9bae0f6a?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/deepnight/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2982-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2982-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2982-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2982-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2982-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2982-shot2.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2982-shot3.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2982-shot3.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2982-shot4.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/163678/2982-shot4.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Play (web)","url":"http://deepnight.net/games/ld24-strikeofrage/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://deepnight.net/games/ld24-strikeofrage/source.zip"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://youtu.be/3w2JMINr2sg"},{"label":"Play (post compo entry)","url":"http://deepnight.net/games/ld24-strikeofrage/extended/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"fun","rank":1,"score":4.31},{"area":"graphics","rank":2,"score":4.7},{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":55},{"area":"overall","rank":4,"score":4.22},{"area":"humor","rank":13,"score":3.92},{"area":"mood","rank":30,"score":3.76},{"area":"audio","rank":55,"score":3.51},{"area":"innovation","rank":385,"score":2.82},{"area":"theme","rank":598,"score":2.29}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":24,"title":"textcraft","category":"compo","description":"A very simple (text) world editor.
