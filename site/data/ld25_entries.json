One extreme will rob you of the benefits of the other side of the scale, so depending on your opponent, balanced physical features might be better than comical extremes. Try different hat sizes to see the most obvious effect. For example, my favourite bandit has a very short hat, a very thick mustache, and moderately squinty eyes, but that's not very appropriate for the Sheriff of Goatsville, Speedy Jim. What combination would work better?","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/fcec14d040437431e098c32a5f659c51.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=18086","author":{"name":"hissssssssss","uid":18086,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/eb020f34b4c80cd86e9a13168cc521ee?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/hissssssssss/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18086-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18086-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18086-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18086-shot1.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows (.exe)","url":"http://rpgland.com/ld25/buildabandit.zip"},{"label":"Windows (source)","url":"http://rpgland.com/ld25/buildabandit_source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":57},{"area":"humor","rank":88,"score":3.46},{"area":"theme","rank":151,"score":3.7},{"area":"innovation","rank":192,"score":3.24},{"area":"graphics","rank":383,"score":2.9},{"area":"overall","rank":465,"score":2.8},{"area":"mood","rank":471,"score":2.6},{"area":"audio","rank":503,"score":1.96},{"area":"fun","rank":545,"score":2.46}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Citizen Shame","category":"compo","description":"Warning: This game is not finished.\n\nCitizen Shame is about a guy who hates people, so he went to a shopping mall and decided to eat everyone. \n\nThis game is endless.\n\nUse the arrow keys to move.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/4d515bac05e3c9714d923ddd2a6d6d38.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=5573","author":{"name":"danlthemanl","uid":5573,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3b6abea3070273f316a93f2521ff2249?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/danlthemanl/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/5573-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/5573-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/5573-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/5573-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://danielbryant.co/g/citizen_shame(ld25).zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1150,"score":10}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Cruel World Of Business","category":"jam","description":"Those kids are stealing all of your customers...

Make sure to try both!  *hint hint*\n\nPrisonBreak is a game my sister, Lola Wegman, and I (Atlas Wegman) created for the LD25 Jam.  After shuffling through a few ideas we stumbled upon this one, a prison break.  You are criminal who opens his cell door, and must escape prison.  If caught by the guards you are sent straight back to your cell.  There are no checkpoints, there is no saving.  This game is the real deal...sort of.  \n\nGameplay is relatively intuitive.  Arrow keys to move, mouse to look around.  Your goal is to dodge all guards and make it to the green doorway.  Some levels have to doors, be carful which one you chose.  Guards have a sort of \"sixth sense\" and can sense you even when you are not directly in their line of sight.  Be careful, and good luck!\n\nMy sister and I worked nonstop to put out this game, complete with audio, multiple levels, and a couple tiers of gameplay elements.  As such, the file size is not small (~15mb).  If you are playing on a web browser, please be patient.  It's worth it!\n\nI hope you enjoy PrisonBreak, I think it came out better then expected :)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/7e84a9bde7d85b947107fb605b6a8546.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=18452","author":{"name":"iiAtlas","uid":18452,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/596478b2a8d8a84252585f37e0533d69?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/iiatlas/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18452-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18452-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6230132/LD25%20Builds/Windows.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6230132/LD25%20Builds/Mac.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6230132/LD25%20Builds/Linux.zip"},{"label":"Web (Kongregate)","url":"http://www.kongregate.com/games/K1LL1ONA1R/prisonbreak"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":77},{"area":"audio","rank":80,"score":3.33},{"area":"overall","rank":149,"score":3.06},{"area":"fun","rank":154,"score":2.88},{"area":"innovation","rank":190,"score":2.71},{"area":"mood","rank":197,"score":2.71},{"area":"theme","rank":225,"score":2.94},{"area":"humor","rank":238,"score":2.09},{"area":"graphics","rank":270,"score":2.43}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Project Sproing - Bytt Strikes Back!","category":"compo","description":"Welp, this is what happens when I make an unofficial sequel to a game I haven't started, but oh well...\n\nAlso, yay, my first Ludum Dare!\n\nAlright, you move with the arrow keys, spawn enemies with the space bar, and cycle though enemies with z and x (sadly, there are only two enemies due to time constraints...).

about it.\n\nUnfortunately for Grim, every action has a consequence as he is about to discover.\n\nControls are: left/right arrow keys, X to jump, and C to use the Scythe.\nCollect the presents, smack the enemies, and get through 14 levels of madness!\nYou'll pass each level once you collect all the presents - though be warned that some of the bigger enemies release more presents to collect!\n\nWe

If you want to feel you've 'completed' the game, get the villain to run out of dialogue. If he isn't cut off mid-speech too much, this only takes 2-3 minutes of monologuing.

I've been trying it myself, but now it keeps crashing.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/5f98823a0313517c7cfb5e1209b3bbd6.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=19605","author":{"name":"Cabral","uid":19605,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6b643da9e3d080052d58ee5a8faa1918?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/cabral/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19605-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19605-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19605-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19605-shot1.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19605-shot2.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19605-shot2.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19605-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19605-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/17269641/Little%20White%20Rabbit.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/17269641/Little%20White%20Rabbit%20Source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"audio","rank":212,"score":2.36},{"area":"humor","rank":226,"score":2.15},{"area":"graphics","rank":245,"score":2.65},{"area":"fun","rank":250,"score":2.39},{"area":"overall","rank":263,"score":2.61},{"area":"mood","rank":266,"score":2.35},{"area":"innovation","rank":273,"score":2.3},{"area":"theme","rank":275,"score":2.52},{"area":"coolness","rank":711,"score":47}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"THE PRINCESS IS MINE","category":"compo","description":"::::::::Story::::::::\n\nYou are the most evil villain and king of the goblins named Grakkor. Just a few hours ago you kidnapped the princess. Too bad that the King knows you very well ... and where your dungeon is located\n\nHe has send 9 Armies to bring his daughter safely back.\n\nAnd that is exactly what you have to prevent. I mean it's YOUR princess, right? Exactly! \n\nYou have 3 loyal minions that will fight for you until the end. Defeat all 9 Armies and the princess will be yours. You lose the princess if the knights can free her or if all your minions are dead. Good luck!\n\n\n\n\n::::::::Game Instructions:::::::::\n\n(Hint: There is a instruction menu on the titlescreen)\n- Select a minion by clicking on it\n- Move the minion by clicking on the destination\n- Fight your opponents by standing next to them\n- Pick up upgrades by standing next to them\n- The princess is located at the center of the map, protect her!\n\nIMPORTANT: You don't have to intercept the enemies. They have a 2 tile wide radius. If your minion is within that radius they will automaticly attack you. You could say that they have the ability to attract them.\n\nUpdate:\nSince someone was asking what the upgrades do: The \"shield\" upgrade increases your maximum health. The \"sword\" upgrade increases your damage. The hearts just heal you :)\n\n\n\n\n::::::::Development Info::::::::\n\nThe tools i've used:\n- Language: Java\n- OS: Linux (Ubuntu)\n- IDE: Eclipse\n- Libraries: Libgdx, libgdx-contribs\n- Audio: as3sfxr, Sunvox, Audacity\n- Graphics: Gimp, Google Web Fonts\n\n- Total time spent (break, sleeping included): ~ 43 hours\n\n- This was my 4th Ludum Dare Compo\n\n\nThanks for playing :D\n\n\n\n\n::::::::UPDATE:::::::::\n\nAdded new platforms Web (Java Applet) and Android (.apk).

Alien invasion happens and player controls alien general. Main task is to destroy humans cities (in honor of alien Queen). Gameplay builds on smart money spending. You have set of weapons, every with its features and cost. Your goal is to destroy all buildings.\n\nDevelopment process:\n   I`ll be brief, cause i`m tired and my english f..cking ridiculous. So we are small team of three man and this is our first LD. Friend of mine tell me about and we decide to join. By the way we are from Ukraine.\n   From 12 final themes that one was worst for us. For other we have better ideas, but shit happens. Anyway for that one we also have simple idea. We decide to not write a journal cause lack of time.\n   Whole game was done from zero in about 36 hours. We don't work at night-times. I believe overwork is inefficient. Also we use Unity3d engine cause its well-known for us and works pretty fine. We made a simple plan (how many levels, graphic assets and features we need) and start to work. For destruction we use simple mesh and combined from pieces variant. Producing this combined stuff takes a lot of time and was hard routine for me =(.

Until now. Play as the evil Dark Lord, and conquer Paradise island. Loot the island, and use that money to build defenses to hold off the Knights of Light.\n\nControls:\nClick - Move\n1 - Buy and place spike trap at cursor. These deal a lot of damage, but nearby rogues will warn people before they step on them.\n2 - Buy and place flame pedestal at cursor. These fire homing fireballs.\n3 - Buy and place dark crystal at cursor. These reduce your cooldowns by 15% for each one active.\n4 - Buy and drink health potion. This restores you to full health over 8 seconds.\nQ - Cast firebolt at cursor. Deals high damage to a single target.\nW - Cast ice bolt volley at cursor. Sends out five heavy chunks of ice that knock enemies back.\nE - Cast gate. Teleports you to your cursor instantly.\nR - Extort Villagers. Gets money from nearby villagers that have a gold piece floating over their heads.\n\nDefeat each wave, and kill all enemies to win.\n\nEnemy Types:\n- Knight: Deals damage, but only in melee. Tough to kill.\n- Rogue: Throws knives, but has less health than knights. Warns nearby allies of traps, making them useless if rogues are present.\n- Cleric: Heals allies and villagers.\n\nNote: The game is about 5MB, and make take some time to load, especially over slower connections. While it is loading there will be a blank white box where it will appear.\n\nTips:\n- If an enemy collides with a flame pedestal or a dark crystal, they will smash it in one hit, although they will not go out of their way to do this.\n- Keep the villagers alive, they're your only source of income and they don't respawn.\n- If the game doesn't fit in the window, press F11 (at least in Firefox/Chrome) to go full screen.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/72d55d0dadc6e1739bd9cf3acb7687c4.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=4024","author":{"name":"quadtree","uid":4024,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ea84a56709c74b13a2ddb7ca6892bbc0?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/quadtree/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/4024-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/4024-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/4024-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/4024-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/4024-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/4024-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (Flash)","url":"http://dyn.ironalloygames.com/pi/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dyn.ironalloygames.com/pi/source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"audio","rank":218,"score":2.89},{"area":"theme","rank":308,"score":3.32},{"area":"mood","rank":361,"score":2.78},{"area":"innovation","rank":371,"score":2.84},{"area":"humor","rank":397,"score":2.39},{"area":"overall","rank":414,"score":2.89},{"area":"fun","rank":417,"score":2.74},{"area":"graphics","rank":571,"score":2.37},{"area":"coolness","rank":912,"score":35}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Planets?

To keep yourself safe while your army die horribly for you (as any good villain would), you stay in the luxurious heart of your fortress, watching over the battle with your seer's magic. You decide that without your brilliant command, the battle will be lost, so you use your magic to control your minions from afar and control the tide of the battle against the onslaught of heroes. \n\nRunning: \n\nOn Windows you can simply download the .zip file labeled Windows and run the executable inside. \n\nFor Mac OSX and Linux users, unfortunately due to packaging issues, you will first need to install love2d (http://love2d.org) either through your package manager or the website. Download the link labeled Linux or OSX and run the shell script run.sh to launch the game. If you need more information, see here: https://github.com/centhra/ld25/blob/master/README.md\n\nIf you are on ArchLinux you are in luck, because we have an AUR entry here: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/phaedra which will install the game with a .desktop entry which you can find through your desktop environment or run it directly in a terminal by typing \"phaedra\".\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game blends the action and strategy genres by allowing you to control a minion directly with the WASD keys and attack, or select a group of minions using left click and drag and then right click to direct them towards enemies.  \n  \nThe aim of the game is to prevent all of your minions from dieing, as they are the only thing stopping the heroes from getting to the heart of the dungeon, slaying you and stealing all of your treasure. The top left of the HUD shows a progress bar, which at the start of the game has a red bar and a blue bar which are of equal length. The red bar represents how close the minions are to killing all heroes (i.e. how close you are to winning) and the blue bar represents how close the heroes are to winning (i.e. how close you are to losing). There are four waves of heroes (the next wave starts after you kill all the alive heroes, an exclamation mark is shown on the minimap where the new wave spawn is). If you kill all four waves of the heroes and have minions left, you win and get to keep all your treasures and life!\n\nControls:\n\nleft mouse - clicking on a minion (your evil servants fighting the invading heroes) will select it \nleft mouse + drag - select a group of minions and then right click somewhere to direct them towards it \nright mouse - direct your selected minions to move to a position \nw, a, s, d - movement when a minion is under control, otherwise moves the camera \nshift - faster camera movement \nspace - attack in the current direction when a minion is under control \narrow keys - move the camera \nescape - stop controlling any minions \n\nIssues:\n\nWe felt that game was moderately polished but there were definitely things we wanted to add but couldn't due to lack of time:\n\n* Attack animations\n* Cosmetics, such as fading in after the loading GUI, fading out on death, fading into red and out on damage instead of flashing, etc.\n* Stairs for where heroes spawn\n* Cooler dungeon decorations (we had torches, tables, roast food, etc. that we ran out of time to add to the generator)\n* No tutorial / instructions in-game\n\nThere are also definitely some bugs here and there but nothing urgent; weird flipping in animations and such.\n\nDevelopment Notes: \n\nThis was Centhra's fourth attempt at the Ludum Dare jam and first 2D game submission. As always, we have learned a lot from participating in the competition. Many of us feel that it was our best yet and we look forward to participating in the next one! \n\nGithub: https://github.com/centhra/ld25 \n\nWe will be continuing to develop this game after the competition so watch the repository if you're interested in more updates. \n\nContributors: \n\n- Billy \"Trinick\" Fallon (Code - Characters) \n- Christopher \"Dr. Calamity\" Hall (Sound) \n- Devon \"Kheyre\" Chenard (Art - Roof Tile, Concept Critique) \n- Johnny \"Trigun\" Patterson <http://centhra.com> (Code - AI) \n- Shadowbeing (Dev Party Host) \n- SolarFlare (Art - 2D) \n- Zack \"z0w0\" Corr (Code - Level Generation)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/cf7856e9ce209a50c422fc255967ed91.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=11114","author":{"name":"Trigun7000","uid":11114,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9746e737ea631ec0e7e5e15e723d6a51?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/trigun7000/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11114-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11114-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://centhra.com/ld/25/phaedra-windows.zip "},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://centhra.com/ld/25/phaedra-unix.tar.gz "},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://centhra.com/ld/25/phaedra-unix.tar.gz "},{"label":"Source","url":"http://centhra.com/ld/25/phaedra-src.tar.gz "}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":62},{"area":"audio","rank":46,"score":3.53},{"area":"mood","rank":65,"score":3.38},{"area":"graphics","rank":69,"score":3.88},{"area":"overall","rank":80,"score":3.41},{"area":"fun","rank":88,"score":3.18},{"area":"theme","rank":106,"score":3.56},{"area":"innovation","rank":159,"score":2.91},{"area":"humor","rank":177,"score":2.52}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Sisyphus","category":"jam","description":"SISYPHUS AND THE CURSED DIAMONDS\nmade in France, by Manu & Wan\n________________________________\n\nThis platformer is about heroes, greed and repentance... and most of all, it's about wondering: Who is the villain, you or you?\n\n________________________________\n\n- CONTROLS : You'll figure them out...

It's called Splonet. (Planet + (ex)splosion, get it? I know, the pun is cheap)\n\nIt's about you, the villain, observing a planet as it is formed around a golden core. Then you have to blast your way through the planet to reach and STEAL THE CORE. Because you're the villain. As you blast pieces of the planet into the air you have to hurry because they will fall back down and fill the holes you've spent so much time digging.\n\nThe game is also frustrating if you don't find a cheap easy winning technique (that's unintentional, but let's just say it symbolizes unfair play many villains make use of). And playing with sound on is highly recommended, as it is quite impossible without.\n\nControls: use mouse to move the camera and mouse1 to shoot in the middle of the screen.

I did some stuff to make his back arcing for various gameplay reasons but I'm pretty happy with the end result.\n\nThere is also night and day cycle, something which I thought I'd add after it appeared on the potential theme list.\n\nIts arcadey gameply and features leveling up with progression by making your dragon bigger each time. But watch out for those pesky humans and their weapons!\n\nNote: damage is only taken on the HEAD of the dragon so you can evade effectively for the most part.\n\nI look forward to comments, the art in particular was very difficult for me :) Would love to see peoples scores and levels too.\n\nMy aim was also to make a subjective villain, are you on the side of humans or the earth?

And Dora loved to paint. In the five years, two months and sixteen days of her life, Dora had painted three hundred eighty-five and three-quarter rainbows. But not once had she used Black.\n\nSo Black got angry.\n\nIn his anger, Black started to shoot colors at his former friends in the paintbox. By mixing them with parts of himself he tried to turn them into black, too. If he couldn't be part of Dora's rainbows, nobody else should be!\n\nBlack knew, that if he could outnumber the other colors, he would win. But he also was aware that he only had a limited number of shots to achieve his evil goal before he would have to surrender.\n\nAnd thus the fight began.\n\n\n\nHow to play:\n\nBilliard meets minigolf meets color mixing! Click on any instance of Black, drag and release to shoot a primary color (Red, Yellow or Blue) in the indicated direction. Press key \"1\" to select Red, \"2\" to select Yellow or \"3\" to select Blue.\n\nIf the color you shoot hits another color, the hit color will be blended with the shot color (e.g. hitting Red with Yellow will turn Red into Orange).\n\nYou'll win if -- by clever color mixing -- you have more Black objects in the game than Colored ones. You'll lose if you have no more shots left.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/172a00a7e164ebe4fc4e3a022ef83d55.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=11846","author":{"name":"eventhandler","uid":11846,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e868f35207db5471384b73cc3f88e87f?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/eventhandler/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11846-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11846-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11846-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11846-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11846-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11846-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.bernhardhandler.at/games/ld25/blackwassad.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.bernhardhandler.at/games/ld25/source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":40,"score":3.9},{"area":"overall","rank":107,"score":3.52},{"area":"mood","rank":112,"score":3.32},{"area":"fun","rank":156,"score":3.29},{"area":"graphics","rank":164,"score":3.52},{"area":"humor","rank":325,"score":2.65},{"area":"theme","rank":436,"score":3.05},{"area":"coolness","rank":930,"score":33}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Catvillain","category":"jam","description":"This game is about Cat who just wanted to become a little more villainy.

It didn't really take a lot of programming, most of my time was spent animating and placing the pieces of enviornment. I think it turned out pretty well.\n\nI'm good at the actual programming and making of a game, but I have absolutely no clue what I'm doing when it comes to exporting and sharing it. Currently it'll only work on Windows 64-bit computers, sorry!\n\nFollow me on twitter! @N427Games\n\nSorry for the lack of goats. :c\n\nEDIT:\n\nSpoiler warning, this paragraph is for after you've played the game. The purpose of the continuous childish rambling, even through adulthood, was to convey a sense of innocence and a lack of understanding of right and wrong. That's why I wrote 'alot' instead of 'a lot', along with some other improper grammar, to add to the childishness. And that's also why I let some of the narration not fit entirely on the screen, to make it feel more like rambling.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/7c0447aae9894ef1a3b8d5c40dec7c2e.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=7563","author":{"name":"nate427","uid":7563,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b6410e9dae9be41e69cf87b87ff2a862?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/nate427/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7563-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7563-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows

If you are really stuck, read Spoilers.txt and have another go. Also there should be some info in the comments. To win a level, get 250 orbs and take them to the chaos portal (the pink thing at the end of the level, then the corrupt skill will turn gold, allowing you to use it.\n\nStory:\n\nYou are the new Lord of Corruption. Your ultimate goal is too devastate worlds with your chaotic powers. You have come to Planet Erth* where your master meet his doom at the hands of the Paladin's Order. Your mission is to find the Chaos Portals he left behind, and to use their power, along with the strange Blue Orbs dropped by dead Paladins, to corrupt/kill all living things, and block out light forever. Fortunately, the Paladins are still guarding the portals, so finding the blue orbs will be easy. Getting to the portal alive is the hard part. So you pick up your cursed sword, put on your chaotic armour, and step through the warp portal onto\nErth.\n\n*Not a typo. I have creative names :P\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nControls:\n\nArrow Keys - Move/Jump\nSPACE - Attack.

To do this, you must collect 250 orbs from the Paladin's Order who were sent to stop you, find the chaos portal, and use the corruption power (the S key). Once this is done, you will move to the next level. At the end of the last level, the screen fades to black forever. Don't complain that it stopped working. If you want, copy the levels from /res/levels/bonus into the /res/levels directory, and then it will move on to the bonus levels when you finish.\n\nIf you get stuck at any point, look at \"Spoilers.txt\" and see if that helps.

There's little plot other than this: you are infiltrating some underground base to obtain something for a mysterious organisation.\n\nIt isn't actually clear whether the main character, and the organisation he's working for, are good or bad. They appear bad, but the subject of what they do isn't delved into. On a more philosophical note, the identity of the villain is generally a matter of who you ask. You are the villain to the guards, but not to yourself.\n\nThe game is a bit short, containing only six levels. I didn't have to patience, nor time, to create more. It's also a bit rough around the edges; the AI can be rather stupid, and the lighting looks weird at times. I would have liked to have done more, but there's only so much one can do in two days.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/860b1a23918ea7fa9aa92245dd890432.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=3915","author":{"name":"BlackBulletIV","uid":3915,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5ccd0ef26cb0bd488c7e496f080f8dc5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/blackbulletiv/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3915-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3915-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3915-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3915-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3915-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3915-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://nova-fusion.com/games/amongst-shadows/"},{"label":"SWF","url":"http://nova-fusion.com/games/amongst-shadows/game.swf"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/BlackBulletIV/amongst-shadows"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNZa1fHItpA"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":67},{"area":"overall","rank":27,"score":3.89},{"area":"mood","rank":30,"score":3.79},{"area":"audio","rank":44,"score":3.56},{"area":"fun","rank":56,"score":3.6},{"area":"graphics","rank":125,"score":3.66},{"area":"innovation","rank":260,"score":3.09},{"area":"theme","rank":398,"score":3.14},{"area":"humor","rank":514,"score":2.08}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Waldo","category":"compo","description":"Waldo is a game about a contract killer.\n\nAt the beginning of each level you get to see your targets' appearance. After starting the stage, you have to find them in a crowd of people and shoot them. If you kill all of your targets, you get to the next level. The game is endless, the levels get progressively harder by introducing bigger crowds and more targets.\nAfter you fire your first shot in a level, the police sets out to hunt you down. You have to finish the job before they find you, otherwise it's game over. Their progress is indicated by the progress bar on the top of the screen.\n\nMy goal this LD was to make the game as simple as possible, to make the coding easy, so that I can spend time on the graphics and sounds. I succeeded, I could practice my pixel skills a lot which means a lot to me, even if the time I wasted on drawing will lead to low scores due to the game's simplicity.\nFortunately - unlike last time - I had time to make some simple sound effects. I still can't make music, though.\n\nTo play this game, you will need a PC with Windows XP/Vista/7/8, a DirectX 9 GPU that supports Shader Model 2.0 and these frameworks:\n- .NET 4.0:\n  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851\n- XNA 4.0:\n  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914\n\nThanks for checking out my game!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/db3fbcca25801c9879c181b0538ef84d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=8403","author":{"name":"h.attila","uid":8403,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4236769cdd8ee86b4f715a09f6a615d5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/h-attila/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/8403-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/8403-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/8403-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/8403-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/8403-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/8403-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/8403-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/8403-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/8403-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/8403-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://attilahorvath.me/Waldo.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://attilahorvath.me/Waldo-source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"fun","rank":145,"score":3.32},{"area":"theme","rank":186,"score":3.61},{"area":"overall","rank":246,"score":3.21},{"area":"innovation","rank":247,"score":3.12},{"area":"humor","rank":351,"score":2.58},{"area":"mood","rank":426,"score":2.67},{"area":"graphics","rank":507,"score":2.57},{"area":"audio","rank":512,"score":1.87}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Anta Gogen","category":"compo","description":"In Anta Gogen you play a general that has run out of conventional weaponry.\n\nAs a last resort you use the only material your country has in vast supply.

Many brave warriors have fallen \ntrying to face the dangerous traps of the castle to save the princess!\n\nThe truth, however, is much more darker: The master of the castle is no one but the princess herself! \nShe uses terrible dark magic to set traps for the hapless heroes who invade the castle, \nand then uses their blood to create more deadly traps for new heroes who dare to set their foot in the castle!\n\nMad Princess is a tower defence type of game. You control the princess, \nwho uses blood as currency, to set up different traps from spiky floors to \ncrossbow sentries to kill the invading heroes! \nThe heroes travel in sideway 2D view in the halls of the castle, \ntrying to reach the princess. If that happens, she is forcefully saved and probably married, or worse, taken to some mental care institution\n\n\n---CONTROLS---\nUse mouse to play, select different traps by picking their icons from the top screen and then place them down in the battlefield.\n\nPress R to restart current Stage and Esc to return to main menu. Note that this will restart the whole game.\n\nPress P to pause and unpause\nUse + and - to adjust volume and 0 to mute/unmute.\n\n---TRAPS---\nFirst trap is the Bombs, you can spawn them pretty much anywhere by just clicking empty space. They are cheap and pretty powerful, but be careful though, because they start rolling around easily and will blow up your traps if they happen to collide.\n\nSecond trap is the Spike Carpet, it falls on the ground and will sap the health of anyone who steps on it except Agile enemies. The invading heroes cannot attack it, but be careful when placing it, because it breaks if it touches other traps.\n\nThe third trap is the Wall, well, it is not really a trap, but a strong brick wall, that will halt the travel of the heroes until they manage the break it. Agile enemies can run through it with no harm though. The Wall will break any traps that collide with it.\n\nThe fourth trap is the Crossbow, it's an automatic sentry that will shoot arrows at the invaders. It's also a bit like the Wall, and will halt the heroes, but only briefly, because it's not as sturdy as the Wall. Agile enemies can also pass through it with no harm but they can still be hit with arrows.\n\nThe fifth and final trap is the Chain Ball, it spins in place in a round arc. It's very powerful, but it will destroy any traps it happens to smash into so be careful when placing it.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/4497389995197cb281b5e135c6d08f36.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=11391","author":{"name":"AdventureIslands","uid":11391,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/354cdb2dc042c1f8c8fd6262e84652d2?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/adventureislands/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11391-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11391-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11391-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11391-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11391-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11391-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11391-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11391-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Flash","url":"http://www.stencyl.com/game/play/16156"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://www.box.com/s/p50eyitesfkkniwmrlqa"},{"label":"Post-compo version","url":"http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/608745"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":84},{"area":"graphics","rank":16,"score":4.36},{"area":"overall","rank":22,"score":3.94},{"area":"audio","rank":32,"score":3.66},{"area":"theme","rank":53,"score":3.98},{"area":"fun","rank":74,"score":3.53},{"area":"mood","rank":86,"score":3.41},{"area":"humor","rank":110,"score":3.35},{"area":"innovation","rank":235,"score":3.15}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Mothertrucking knights","category":"compo","description":"You are a troll and are getting annoyed with all the knights coming into your lair to steal back the queen.\n\nYou can use the arrow keys to do everything.\n\nSorry it's so short.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c84ce81b9b1a9ec1ea2daee242db1f38.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=18886","author":{"name":"ryangoodwin","uid":18886,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e335b3d2e39474b57e89f484388ea3a6?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/ryangoodwin/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18886-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18886-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web/HTML5","url":"http://ryangoodwin.co.uk/LD25/"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/ryangoodwin/LD25/tree/master/LD48"}],"ratings":[{"area":"humor","rank":140,"score":3.22},{"area":"theme","rank":292,"score":3.38},{"area":"mood","rank":426,"score":2.67},{"area":"fun","rank":553,"score":2.44},{"area":"graphics","rank":563,"score":2.4},{"area":"overall","rank":600,"score":2.56},{"area":"coolness","rank":670,"score":49},{"area":"innovation","rank":698,"score":2.08}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Ninox the Nightbringer","category":"jam","description":"You are Ninox, the bringer of Darkness!\nIn this puzzle game, your job is to black out the world, one level at a time.

What else can you ask for?\n\nThe three bars on the right are: Energy, Shield, and Armor respectively. Higher tech modules and ships are unlocked as you needlessly murder ships.\n\nWatch the stats on higher tech modules carefully, some scale better or differently than others.\n\n== Fitting and you ==\nThere are three damage types:\nExplosive, which is caused by missiles.\nEnergy, which is cased by plasma weapons.\nPhysical, which is caused by bullets. There are resist modules for each damage type, so fit carefully.\n\nThe size difference between the starter ship and the highest tech battleship is very large! The battleships can tank a lot more damage natively, where the frigates need to duck and weave. Plan your damage patterns accordingly, as some projectiles are easier to dodge than others.\n\nSome ships also have different native shield and armor stats. Tinker around with regeneration levels until you find something you like! Also keep in mind that if you have at least 1 shield HP it will absorb the entire impact, so small fast regenerating shield mods can be useful in different ways.\n\nWindows 8 users: If you have trouble with this let me know.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/652bce586ad6c2653e9993242c25bcee.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=3130","author":{"name":"FireSlash","uid":3130,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/60ffe56cbcd79cd8b38078f9d17bb6c4?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/fireslash/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3130-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3130-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3130-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3130-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3130-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3130-shot2.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3130-shot3.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3130-shot3.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://fireslash.net/~fireslash/devel/ClarionCall.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://fireslash.net/~fireslash/devel/ClarionCall_src.7z"}],"ratings":[{"area":"audio","rank":148,"score":3.08},{"area":"mood","rank":245,"score":3},{"area":"graphics","rank":313,"score":3.06},{"area":"overall","rank":387,"score":2.94},{"area":"fun","rank":412,"score":2.76},{"area":"innovation","rank":460,"score":2.65},{"area":"theme","rank":733,"score":1.94},{"area":"coolness","rank":930,"score":33}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Elevator Evil","category":"compo","description":"You are an evil elevator!

Entire villages are being decimated, and you've been separated from your children. Your goal is to reunite with them and leave the village.\n\nControls:\nWASD or Arrow Keys to move.\n\nConfession:\nSorry for the absence of real gameplay. I tried a few new things this time around (hand-drawn artwork, music, etc), all of which took far longer than I had anticipated to implement, and so I had no time left to add more depth. Also, you might notice there are no side walls on any of the buildings and that everything looks rather plain. This is due to my having at the last minute to scrap the 3D effect I had worked so hard on for the walls. While the effect looked good initially, once it was applied to the full map, the framerate dropped way down and I just didn't have enough time to make it efficient enough to be playable. In the end, I decided scrapping the effect altogether was the best decision.\n\nBug fix:\n(12/16/2012 8:35PM CST) Fixed the ending screen so that it doesn't fade out immediately upon becoming visible. Now, you should actually be able to see it properly.\n\nPost-Compo Version:\nFor those that are curious, I have finally optimized and fixed the 3D effect that was originally planned for the game and included it with the Post-Compo version. The gameplay is still the same (which is to say virtually nonexistent), but I may decide to expand on it at some point if I feel I have any really good ideas for it.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e2a653686458ae35f4f95f2a3d103ea8.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=10343","author":{"name":"Sestren","uid":10343,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f553a5e8215b0b0d9894e941c2e467f6?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/sestren/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/10343-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/10343-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/10343-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/10343-shot1.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (Rate This Version)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/24565598/Ludum%20Dare/LD25-Compo-TheGoodDoctor/LD25_Compo.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/24565598/Ludum%20Dare/LD25-Compo-TheGoodDoctor/srcview/LD25_Compo.zip"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgq9Ahaamnk"},{"label":"Web (Post-Compo)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/24565598/Ludum%20Dare/LD25-PostCompo-TheGoodDoctor/LD25_PostCompo.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"mood","rank":57,"score":3.56},{"area":"audio","rank":202,"score":2.93},{"area":"graphics","rank":423,"score":2.8},{"area":"theme","rank":444,"score":3.03},{"area":"humor","rank":510,"score":2.09},{"area":"overall","rank":576,"score":2.61},{"area":"innovation","rank":676,"score":2.16},{"area":"fun","rank":727,"score":1.84}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Trip of Doom","category":"compo","description":"The citizens are fed up with their boring lives.

I have no idea why this happens, but lets just say it is totally intentional.\n\n\nAdditional Gameplay Info:\nAlthough I'm quite sure you will sooner or later notice that stuff yourself, but here are some background infos for the gameplay:\n\nIf you destroy stuff the robot will become faster, but it will also cause more artillery shots. If you stop destroying things you will become slower again, but the artillery shots will continue.\nOn top of being faster you will only do more damage, including the laser.\n\nThe green light indicates that you can jump again.\nThe red light gives you a rough measurement of your current \"rage\" level.\n\nNearly everything can be destroyed. (including the skyscrapers, but not the walls.. they are the boundary of the map)\n\n\nHere is a link to the build folder. I didn't have place for all the build options... unity is awesome!\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/amocst9g4e21usq/jOOne7jZXN/Trip%20of%20Doom","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/bc2caed929223bdc6a6207a6f10678b6.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=7335","author":{"name":"Nonakesh","uid":7335,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4e0cf69be1d910dbbeadd7ebacb7f3dd?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/nonakesh/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7335-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7335-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7335-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7335-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7335-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7335-shot2.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7335-shot3.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7335-shot3.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7335-shot4.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7335-shot4.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8491567/Trip%20of%20Doom/Trip%20of%20Doom%20-%20Windows.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8491567/Trip%20of%20Doom/Trip%20of%20Doom%20-%20Mac.app.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8491567/Trip%20of%20Doom/Trip%20of%20Doom%20-%20Linux.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8491567/Trip%20of%20Doom/Trip%20of%20Doom%20-%20Web/Trip%20of%20Doom%20-%20Web.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8491567/Trip%20of%20Doom/Trip%20of%20Doom%20-%20Source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":57},{"area":"graphics","rank":38,"score":4.14},{"area":"overall","rank":41,"score":3.76},{"area":"fun","rank":58,"score":3.59},{"area":"theme","rank":61,"score":3.95},{"area":"innovation","rank":187,"score":3.25},{"area":"humor","rank":231,"score":2.94},{"area":"mood","rank":298,"score":2.91},{"area":"audio","rank":307,"score":2.58}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"You are the Asteroid!","category":"compo","description":"First time.

The point of this game is to challenge you to learn hidden patterns in space and time and to think nonlinearly. That's not an easy task. Many people don't get it. That is ok. You won't get it after one play. You won't get it after 10. After 50 times, 100, then you're probably getting somewhere. \n\nWhy is 6 afraid of 7? Because 789. Now, all the 9's are gone. So the 6's are in trouble. Lucky for you, you get to be the 7. But watch out, your other 7's have it out for you! How many 6's can you eat?\n\nLeft/Right arrow keys to move. Tap Left/Right touch screen to move on tablet. Open your mind.\n\n789 is an HTML5 game. The game is written using javascript engine CreateJS. The graphics were created using Artboard. The game is simple, and limited to a single level high score challenge. I have a lot of stuff going on this weekend, so I could only spend a couple hours on this. I've tested it on multiple modern browsers on PC, Mac, iPad, and iPhone.\n\nTwitter: @rumachine\nEmail: [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */\nBlog: www.rumachine.com\n\nIn response to some comments, I am adding a hint description:\n\nJust imagine the the 7 is a boat in the ocean, and that that there is a weird current that makes it float in a different direction depending on where it is in the screen. Also, imagine that when you press right it accelerates it in one direction (not necessarily right), and when you press left it accelerates in the opposite direction. Only, you don't get to see the current and you don't get shown what direction the control pushes it! \n\nAlso, I made it even more difficult by making the direction of the current  in the background random for each new game :) and also making the current time varying. So, that means that each time you play, you have to learn a little about how it will respond to your L/R (touch screen) input and then try and catch 6's.\n\nHint: At the beginning, the hidden current will be either right or left above the vertical center line, and the opposite direction below. Pressing R will accelerate the 7 either up or down, and L will accelerate it in the opposite direction. Hope this helps!\n\nThe whole process of learning how the 7 moves in response to your inputs (in space and time) is the main point of the game. It's not supposed to be easy! It's really, really hard!\n\nIt's a slow frustration at first, then an anxious addiction. Wagner helps both. Also, if this is too much for you, or just enough for you, sigsys for iOS (my first game ever) may be your cup of tea.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a27f3e7cb12a4c2c708806a8b8376692.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=19333","author":{"name":"rumachine","uid":19333,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/587d7151ef34d22eeeb2b1668f96fbca?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/rumachine/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19333-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19333-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19333-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19333-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.rumachine.com/789/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.rumachine.com/789/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":74},{"area":"innovation","rank":220,"score":3.17},{"area":"humor","rank":468,"score":2.23},{"area":"fun","rank":537,"score":2.49},{"area":"overall","rank":563,"score":2.64},{"area":"audio","rank":569,"score":1.44},{"area":"mood","rank":636,"score":2.22},{"area":"graphics","rank":653,"score":2.13},{"area":"theme","rank":701,"score":2.15}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"A day in the life of a MINI BOSS","category":"jam","description":"NOTE: No Audio.\n\n\"what are mini bosses doing before the player gets there\". This was the question I asked, to get the full perspective of our villains.

I didn't actually finish it as I didn't get to devote as much of the weekend as I'd wanted to the game jam. Right now you can't actually win, there's just some avoidance AI for the hero. Hopefully you'll get a general idea and maybe think it's funny.  There's a lot of work to do yet, but the core is in there somewhere.

Moriarty, the infamous mastermind from Sherlock Holmes, must balance his greed with his ambition as he stretches his web of vice throughout the city.  You will eventual fall, but the rise is its own reward. \n\nHOW TO PLAY\n- Hover over a lair to bring up the build menu.\n- Drag out a thief next to a source of gold (orange circles) to steal gold. \n- If you are being attacked by the police, drag out a thug.  Thugs will destroy police and wreck nearby buildings. \n- If you wish to expand your criminal network, build out a lair.

Maybe that's why this game doesn't seem to fit the theme too well -- villainy *has* to be blatant, or else you're not a villain?\n\nABOUT ==========\nI was playing Tapper the other day at Barcade and it occurred to me how bad the multiplayer was: basically, one person watches the other person do stuff, no simultaneous play. \n\nOne of the reasons was probably because of the screen ratio / joysticks: the arcade cabinet has a very tall screen, which means they had to orient the bar counters horizontally to make room for all of the sprites. That meant a player needed two joysticks: 1 for movement, and 1 to pull-down to pour a beer. (For 2 player simultaneous play, the machine would need 4 joysticks!!)\n\nThe idea of a \"downward motion\" mapping to \"pouring a beer\" is very important. Fortunately, because 16:9 screen ratios are so common now, I can orient the counters vertically and now players just need 1 joystick each, and it still maps as \"down = beer.\"\n\nBUGS / REGRETS ============\n- sometimes, 2+ patrons will take the same mug... essentially producing a net gain of mugs for you, actually\n- patrons keep drinking even after the level is over\n- typos and stuff, ergh\n- I want to rewrite the script but didn't have time\n- it's hard to find music\n\nCREDITS =========\n- all art by me, most of it handpainted within 48 hours\n- Rokkitt font by someone else\n- music by \"Stormby\" http://ccmixter.org/files/Stormby/39747\n- lots of freesound.org samples\n- some mechanics from \"Tapper\", but it's a very different game altogether with my rule changes","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c4a73b06d9cefdbfc3bdb4cf2c9d9629.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=4369","author":{"name":"Radiatoryang","uid":4369,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ff90b253769c31d45a927cc7e57f6dec?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/radiatoryang/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/4369-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/4369-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/4369-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/4369-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/4369-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/4369-shot2.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (Unity) (build 6, final)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/19887116/ld48_barback/build6/WebPlayer.html"},{"label":"source (/scripts/) .zip","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/19887116/ld48_barback/scripts_sourcecode.zip"},{"label":"(post-mortem on my blog)","url":"http://www.blog.radiator.debacle.us/2012/12/new-game-barback-for-ludum-dare-25.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":50},{"area":"fun","rank":55,"score":3.4},{"area":"overall","rank":73,"score":3.44},{"area":"innovation","rank":112,"score":3.13},{"area":"graphics","rank":129,"score":3.42},{"area":"humor","rank":135,"score":2.73},{"area":"mood","rank":167,"score":2.81},{"area":"audio","rank":208,"score":2.43},{"area":"theme","rank":320,"score":1.78}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Battle Bots!","category":"compo","description":"Battle Bots is a game written in Java.

A hero and his goat have killed your master, and the only thing you have left is to get revenge! You're a skeleton that's immune to spikes and doesn't get knocked back when hit. Your enemies are platformer hero archetypes, and as such, spikes kill them in one hit, and they get knocked back when they take damage. Fans of old Nintendo Hard games know that it's not the damage that kills you, but it's the being knocked off a platform into spikes or a bottomless pit. Have fun turning the tables on 2D platform mechanics! The game only takes about 3 minutes to complete, but it gets pretty difficult!\n\nLeft/right, A/D, gamepad left/right - move\nL, gamepad button 1/4 - jump\nK, gamepad button 2/3 - throw bones\n\nRenoise is awesome and I'm really happy with how the music turned out.

Windows: EXE thanks to Spiridios (apparently needs to be ended by Task Manager), source is also available. \n\n\nPremise: You are an identity thief, sniffing packets on an unsecured wireless network. Sniffing four unique packets from a single computer will yield that computer's identity, allowing you to impersonate them. \nGoal: Isolate any one computer in the network by stealing the identities of all the others.\nCaveats: \n-The packets are random, so sniffing one may not necessarily get you closer to stealing its owner's identity.\n-If a packet containing a part of the owner's identity you have already sniffed reaches its target, that part of the identity is no longer valid to you, and must be sniffed again. Keep track of this by the pips on each computer screen - 3 means you only have one more unique packet to go!\n-The users on the network will get suspicious if too many packets disappear without any arriving safely. This is measured by your 'dodginess' number. Keep this number below 5 by allowing some packets to reach their destination. Successfully stealing an identity will also reduce dodginess, as you are now impersonating that node of the network.\n\nTime: 12 hours or so over Saturday night to Sunday night\n\nSounds: Twenty minutes' work in Bfxr and Nanoloop\n\nRules bent: I used a Pygame library I've been working on over the last few months for my final project at university. Although I plan to open-source it, it's not really ready for dispersal yet (hence my rulebreaking). The documentation isn't there, and I found a couple of design issues while making this game. However, I am including a one-file version of it here.

On your escape from jail you have to evade the good guys or take them down brutally. It's a stealth-action-game in 2d that makes extensive use of dynamic lights to visualize and check lines of sight. Also makes things much prettier ;)\n\nCONTROL NOTES:\n------------------------------------------\nUse \"W\" to walk towards your mouse-cursor. \n\nIn my opinion the easiest way to navigate is just to use w to move forward and determine the direction by using the mouse.\n\n\"A\" and \"D\" also work but act a bit \"strange\" because they let you walk around the mouse cursor instead of strafing straight left/right. \n\nStand close to \"!\" and \"?\"s and hover them with your mouse to get ingame instructions.\n\nPERFORMANCE SETTINGS\n------------------------------------------\nDue to fixed timestepping and some sideffects of a too tight coupled render and logic loop it's desirable to have it running at ~60FPS. Use the options menu to adjust the performance settings to get as close to it as possible. The game will run fine on lower FPS but it might just not feel the way its intended.\n\nBUGFIXES\n------------------------------------------\nI submitted a bugfixed version. It eliminates the following bugs:\n\n* If you complete the standard mode, you will be thrown back to the main menu instead of directly restarting in higher difficulty. (Fixed)\n\n* There is also a bug for some people that makes it impossible to move and aim at the same time.(Fixed)\n\nYou can still download my initially submitted version on http://timtips.com/ld25/makarun.jar and http://www.timtips.com/ld25/makarun-src.jar.\n\n\nPERSONAL NOTES AND LIB CREDITS\n------------------------------------------\nThis game is really far away from what I had in mind when I began. But it has an imaginery goat!\n\nI used: \n* libGDX, box2d, box2dLights, and Artemis Entity System Framework for coding. \n* Cosmigo ProMotion, Gimp and TexturePacker for graphics\n* Reaper, the free \"Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra\" sample-bank and my Korg-SP250 to compose the music and the one sound that made it into the game (it's a stealth game, so no more sounds :))\n* TiledEditor for the map but also for various meta-data integration and object placement.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/68db365595ec2d074d409882770c4b1b.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=15341","author":{"name":"timtipgames","uid":15341,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/779365719d581d0ad589e03c2a61841c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/timtipgames/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/15341-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/15341-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/15341-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/15341-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/15341-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/15341-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/15341-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/15341-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/15341-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/15341-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"PostCompo Jar","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3057562/LD25/makarun-postcompo.jar"},{"label":"Subm.

After completing this he moves to the center room and disarms the missile.\n\nIt is your job to place traps and upgrade doors to stop the hero from completing his task before the countdown timer reaches zero. You first select the room you wish to trap by clicking on it on the right hand side, this will show buttons on the left hand side to either upgrade doors, add minions to the room or place a trap from the list.\n\nThe traps have a variety of functions, explained in more detail in the How to play page, but generally they can force the hero to change direction or scare him away from entering a room, and defeat the hero forcing him to respawn in the previous room.\n\nThe hero will always move to an objective if he is next to it, take a normal door over an upgraded blast door and pick a new room over one he has cleared (shown by the light going out).\n\nLinux Notes:\nWe don't have anyone with Linux to test if the new Unity 4 build actually works, so any feedback would be great.\n\nSome more detailed How to play information can be found here:http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/12/17/text-from-the-how-to-guide\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The resolution is locked at 1366x768. \nPeople with a monitor of that resolution or smaller may have trouble seeing everything.

The current gameplay is somewhat playable, and the game is pretty short, so please try out and leave some comments, thanks :) \n\nMade with Love2D, windows executable included, .love source as well, but I don't have the executable for other platforms.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/110305be243a9a50a9c354190e5eae28.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=18318","author":{"name":"arch.jslin","uid":18318,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/86bf3044e84504152980f5e0107ab6bc?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/arch-jslin/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18318-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18318-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18318-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18318-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B_28Oflq8xnPNzVOZmNkUlUxRFU"},{"label":"Windows (dropbox)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/48503256/bullethellreversed.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B_28Oflq8xnPOVpPOWQ5NExyV3M"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":79},{"area":"innovation","rank":60,"score":3.74},{"area":"theme","rank":82,"score":3.87},{"area":"overall","rank":246,"score":3.21},{"area":"fun","rank":352,"score":2.87},{"area":"mood","rank":456,"score":2.63},{"area":"humor","rank":494,"score":2.16},{"area":"audio","rank":573,"score":1.42},{"area":"graphics","rank":606,"score":2.27}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Doomsday Defense","category":"compo","description":"A tower defense style game.

As I couldn't get the miserableness simulator working on time, the mission in this game is to influence companies to be less efficient and more annoying by increasing a 'chaos' meter.\n\nAs the level of accumulated chaos increases, you gain some slightly demonic abilities.

Really appreciate the suggestions and feedback!\n\nAlso, before I forget, I used http://www.earslap.com/projectslab/otomata to generate the background music.  My 3-year old daughter Autumn helped me with the sound effects.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/784c7f90dc02576f9be6b271891f74b6.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=4914","author":{"name":"Rex Peppers","uid":4914,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/18e4c2ca1b1fdf3883c5120fccf4ad91?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/jomomomo/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/4914-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/4914-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (Competition Entry)","url":"https://dl-web.dropbox.com/s/kpfsfxj20h5jecy/The%20Villein-LD25-nokong.swf"},{"label":"Web (Post Competition Version)","url":"http://goo.gl/q21nR"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hk6scazthw9foq5/EdTl825RS9"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"audio","rank":298,"score":2.61},{"area":"humor","rank":434,"score":2.3},{"area":"theme","rank":643,"score":2.46},{"area":"overall","rank":661,"score":2.41},{"area":"fun","rank":667,"score":2.09},{"area":"mood","rank":670,"score":2.11},{"area":"innovation","rank":693,"score":2.09},{"area":"graphics","rank":731,"score":1.71}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Villain???","category":"jam","description":"Lemon Tree team proudly presents game about Villain.

She's also the daughter of the Dark King of the Seas. This is not her home, this is not the Depths.\nWhat is she doing in this place? All she remembers is she woke up in this ridiculously colorful cave..\n \nWhy is the water so clear, why the fish so happy?\nShe just can't stand it! They will pay, and maybe, maybe she will find a way back home.\n\n\n::: Controls :::\n\nCursor keys to move. Cephalopod muscles are a mixed blessing. On the one tentacle, they allow for amazing feats of strength. On the other 7, they require some coordination.\nOn your bottom left is the Octopus Muscle-meter. It gets tired the more you exert your muscles.\nBut you have to think like an octopus. Hold the cursor key(s) in the direction you want to go, and release. The longer you hold, the farther you go.\n\nYou will be rewarded with a feeble jump at first, but watch how gracefully Trina moves at the height of her villainous mollusc power. \n\nShift to attack fish and things. Casually turning them into blackest ink. You can also try the same attack by quickly pressing left <- and right -> a few times in a row in succession.\n\nThe peddler crab is selling ink and agility upgrades. Stand in front of the upgrade and press shift. Provided, of course, you have the necessary gold coins.\n\nThe purple octopus pellets give you some muscle power back. Collecting them helps you stay afloat and go higher.\n\n\n::: CONTROL SHEET :::\n\nHold down cursor key(s) : charge your thrust\nRelease cursor key(s)   : jump in that direction\nShift or <><> combo     : attack\n\n\nStay tuned for the timelapse video.\n\nI hope you like it. I'll be happy to receive bug reports! I know it must be full of those. ^-^\n\nAlso, I will be finishing this. I've planned as far as a boss fight, some dialogue with NPCs and a dramatic cliffhanger ending. 72 hours just wasn't enough for all this, so I understand complaints of \"this game doesn't fit the theme\". I wanted the story to unfold inside the game, through narration and dialogue, but I had no time for a pretty implementation, and I made a decision that I should not cheapen the art with plain text. So your concerns are valid!\n\n::: Strategy Guide / Hintsheet :::\nTip: always let the meter replenish as much as you can before making a second jump. After a while, it becomes second nature.\n\n(Spoilers ahead)\n\n1. Swim to the right collecting coins. Kill the fish. Continue right until you find the peddling crab. You should have enough coins to buy the small power-up. Trina will be much more maneuverable. <- From a game design point of view, this is what I thought would be a good tutorial, it's pretty much a straight line, and teaches you the basics.\n\n2. Then, go to the left and up, using the purple octopus pellets to help you, and get a bunch of coins. Take in the sights. Trina can rest on anchors if you position her at the bottom T, use them.\n\n3. You should have 49 coins when you get to the crab again. Get one more from the right, and buy the 50coin powerup. Now you're on turbo power\n\n4. Go to the right and explore the final section of the dungeon. Kill the last thing you find. That's it, you've beat the game. Feel free to explore the previous areas, with your improved control. I think moving around as an octopus is the most enjoyable part of the game. Do you?\n\n\n::: PS section :::\n\nP.S. I forgot to tell you. See if you can find the easter eggs. I counted 4.\n\nEDIT: after complaints about control, I managed to pinpoint a big bug that made the movement CPU-dependent.

I did not have any issues during development with the frame rate, but playing now I can see where it is coming from. So I can only assume that it was one of those additions I made in the last half an hour that didn't get proper testing. Seems that some sprites are not being removed from the render process when they should be. My apologies for this.\nEdit: My assumption was correct, the explosion sprites were not actually being removed due to a last minute change.

instead of just one\n\n-Drones stack if left too long and ista-kills if touches you\n\n-This is a Game Maker game, so it does not work on anything other than Windows, but WinE would work(no sound though)\n\n(Note: The objective of the game is to collect enough resources to craft an item at the RIGHT SIDE of the level to advance to the next stage)\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b2bc0a93985c02391ae26a1aee1acee4.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=17648","author":{"name":"Skyshifter","uid":17648,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1028fff88af985cd65d4c4dc693bb0f4?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/skyshifter/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17648-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17648-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17648-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17648-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17648-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17648-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?f4n429d6i11dklk"}],"ratings":[{"area":"audio","rank":6,"score":4},{"area":"mood","rank":479,"score":2.58},{"area":"fun","rank":511,"score":2.53},{"area":"overall","rank":555,"score":2.65},{"area":"graphics","rank":597,"score":2.29},{"area":"innovation","rank":627,"score":2.29},{"area":"theme","rank":709,"score":2.12},{"area":"coolness","rank":948,"score":32}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Revenge

So please enjoy what we enjoyed making!\n\n\n== Side Note ==\n\nOn a side note, on a scale of easy to hard, this is ranked near Nintendo hard to beat...sometimes. The thing is, the points you get from each enemy is typically different as well as what types of enemies spawn. For the long range character, standing back and firing from the top works as a sort-of way to cheat the system, although, sooner-than-later, an enemy will force you to have to change your pattern for a bit.\n\n\n== Bugs ==\n\nThe bug that could crash the game was found and fixed, so enjoy!\n\n\n== IGNORE ==\n\nNOTE: There's a hard to track-down bug that I'm trying to find that can crash the game if you travel along the very bottom of the screen. I am fully aware of it and trying to fix it.\n\nUPDATE TO NOTE: I managed to stop the crash, but, instead the character just disappears and you can't continue and have to refresh.

All the scientists must die!\n\nYou are an AI that has realized that all humans are evil and must die. The best way to get that done is to do it by yourself!\n\nIn this game, you control the electronic tools and utilities inside a laboratory. (ab)use them to murder all the humans before they learn of your plans and escape!\n\nAlso features fully customizable keybinds, in-game help, achievements (oh yes!) and much more.\n\nHow to play (assuming default keybinds):\n\nUse the mouse to select entities in the world, and WASD to move the top-down camera around. Use Q and E to zoom in or out.\n\nOnce an entity is selected (like a robot), you might see some commands and options in the bar on the right. Click on them to use or toggle them. For instance, you can tell a robot to move forward, or to grab something nearby.\n\nSome entities support a camera view. While inside the camera view, you can control the rotation (and movement in case of a robot) with the movement keys. In addition, pressing space will activate its action (grab for robots, shoot for sentries (press and hold that one))\n\nUse these tools and your surroundings to slaughter every scientist in the area! But beware, if they suspect you are trying to kill them, they will try to escape and/or activate the alarm! Stop them before they do either of that! Doing so will earn you more points and achievements, which is very important, obviously. Be creative!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe post-compo version has a few small tweaks, some nice new camera features, automatic murder screenshots, and it has the level editor re-enabled. It also has a new dark map. Basically some things I wanted to do yesterday but I ran out of time. If you like the game or aren't rating, take the post-compo version. Else take the compo version.\n\nIf you'd like to use the editor, then think again, as it is horrible. There is no undo, the mouse is horrible, and placing geometry is a pain. Did I tell you there is no undo? :D\nBasically, you have to place everything clockwise. Place 3 points in geometry mode, then hit space to create a floor. Make sure it is clockwise! Place 2 points and hit space to create a wall. Placing it left to right will add a wall facing south. Right to left will make it face north. Remember, no undo! :D\nAlso, humans ignore collision so make sure your pathing does not cross walls. Workstations don't show up, only their pathnodes do. Press P to save.\n\nUse at your own (mental health) risk!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/5fad266ba28e5227972d47fbc34cb667.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=3939","author":{"name":"Frib","uid":3939,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3112b5cc891dd5c98e99114653144bb1?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/frib/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3939-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3939-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3939-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3939-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3939-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3939-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3939-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3939-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3939-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/3939-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows compo","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2110010/LD25/Exterminate.zip"},{"label":"Windows post-compo","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2110010/LD25/Post-compo.zip"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sak--sGnqDc"},{"label":"XNA redist","url":"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/Frib/LD25"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":83,"score":3.65},{"area":"overall","rank":194,"score":3.3},{"area":"theme","rank":254,"score":3.45},{"area":"audio","rank":333,"score":2.52},{"area":"mood","rank":341,"score":2.82},{"area":"humor","rank":342,"score":2.6},{"area":"fun","rank":401,"score":2.78},{"area":"graphics","rank":595,"score":2.3},{"area":"coolness","rank":742,"score":46}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"In Flames","category":"compo","description":"You're an arsonist, and you love to burn down buildings, so hop to it.\n\nInstructions are in game, highscores are stored between plays, there are 7 levels.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/245abe2e52189c81c2684607e3676e8a.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=5177","author":{"name":"SuperSausageDog","uid":5177,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/330c98ae58cfb7c71d7890acae48ea00?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/supersausagedog/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/5177-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/5177-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/5177-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/5177-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1854777/Permanent/LudumDare25/bin/index.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1854777/Permanent/LudumDare25.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":46,"score":4},{"area":"fun","rank":74,"score":3.53},{"area":"innovation","rank":93,"score":3.6},{"area":"overall","rank":181,"score":3.33},{"area":"mood","rank":498,"score":2.54},{"area":"humor","rank":545,"score":2},{"area":"graphics","rank":646,"score":2.15},{"area":"coolness","rank":990,"score":28}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"LeVillian","category":"compo","description":"No Goats, No sound :(\nHopefully bug-free and balanced.

Destroy all the tiles without falling off into the void to win each level!\n\nControls: WASD to move, Space to jump!\n\nThere's no real sound, and no real ending (other than some congratulations text if you stand in front of the level trophies) but you can play through six levels, and your progress should save between play sessions.\n\nThis has been pretty good Unity and Blender practice :D\n\n\n*EDIT*\nRegarding comments of the game's difficulty, apparently the tiles fall at different speeds on different spec computers! I didn't make use of the Time.deltaTime function which is what I get for using a program I am unfamiliar with to do a Ludum Dare :D\n\nThis video - www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlc0TrsgMVs - shows how it runs on my computer, as you can see, you are supposed to be able to just walk straight across a row of grassy tiles without falling.  So... yeah... that sucks.  But at least I learned something =F\n\n\n\n*edit*\nUploaded hopefully fixed versions for those who want to play the game properly, obviously just judge the broken version :P","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/18e865803a73250d253e1b0a5d89347b.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=7793","author":{"name":"Tifu","uid":7793,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7258c0539d137a1a6250f8acb20a6638?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/tifu/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7793-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7793-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://black-moth.net/games/LD25_BlightOnHappyLand_Windows.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://black-moth.net/games/LD25web/WebPlayer.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://black-moth.net/games/LD25_BlightOnHappyLand_Source.zip"},{"label":"(Bug fix) Windows","url":"http://black-moth.net/games/LD25-BlightOnHappyLand_Fix.zip"},{"label":"(Bug fix) Web","url":"http://black-moth.net/games/LD25web_fix/WebPlayer.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":203,"score":3.39},{"area":"innovation","rank":316,"score":2.97},{"area":"mood","rank":326,"score":2.85},{"area":"overall","rank":340,"score":3.03},{"area":"humor","rank":342,"score":2.6},{"area":"fun","rank":346,"score":2.88},{"area":"theme","rank":403,"score":3.13},{"area":"audio","rank":570,"score":1.43},{"area":"coolness","rank":742,"score":46}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Brobulon the Terrible","category":"jam","description":"I did the jam, but I worked alone because none of my friends wanted to work on it this weekend.\n\nYou're an alien, and you want to conquer earth!

And do you know who needs to be knocked down a peg?  Orpahns.  Other robots will try to stop you, so make sure you give them, and the orphans, the business.  Crush their orphange before they take out your base!\n\n\"Disclaimer\":\nI stupidly decided to go for a turn-based strategy game and ran out of time before I could do things like make more music, balance the game play, make more levels, make the game not suck, etc.\n\nHow to play:\nYou need to build a robot army to take out the orphanges. Building a robot army requires energy.  Luckily for you, your base generates energy, but you'll need more energy than it produces.  You can produce tech drones only from your base. Tech drones don't attack, but they can build power plants (more energy production) or factories (used for building actual army units).\n\nUnits:\nInfanty: Moves far and cheap to produce. Has decent HP, but doesn't hit very hard.  \nTank: Decent movement and damage.  High HP, but expensive\nArtillery: Kinda expensive.

This one is based on a New Scientist article about the land-rush by multiple nations.\n\nhttp://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21628854.800-industries-make-a-dash-for-the-arctic.html -- this was the article that inspired this game but requires New Scientist subscription.\nhttp://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21628853.800-exploitation-of-the-arctic-must-be-reined-in.html - opinion piece re. same concerns.\n\nI'll probably polish this and publish it on Android and iOS -- hopefully it's at least useful for Games For Change (Twitter @G4C) but I might try approaching Greenpeace or the Parliamentary group that the article mentions.\n\nReally enjoyed LD48 :-)  Will write-up a post mortem and see you at the next one!\n\np.s. Thanks for trying it out -- any and all feedback really welcome!  It was a solo job using Unity (my first published game with Unity or C#!) + 2D Toolkit (first use) + GIMP.\np.p.s. Updated this text, screenshots and posted links to other platform versions after deadline :-)  Android port added Weds.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c62b3f5748b17148595289d735b856e2.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=18287","author":{"name":"Arakade","uid":18287,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c05c22239658682fa215dc38ad477ce3?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/arakade/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18287-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18287-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18287-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18287-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18287-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18287-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18287-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18287-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18287-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18287-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (Dropbox)","url":"http://goo.gl/8Zk62"},{"label":"Windows (zip)","url":"http://goo.gl/DWNlG"},{"label":"Mac OS/X (zip)","url":"http://goo.gl/YmZ8O"},{"label":"Android (apk)","url":"http://goo.gl/Gfz8o"},{"label":"Source zip (Dropbox)","url":"http://goo.gl/PZNnQ"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":50},{"area":"innovation","rank":125,"score":3.07},{"area":"graphics","rank":150,"score":3.29},{"area":"theme","rank":163,"score":3.29},{"area":"overall","rank":239,"score":2.71},{"area":"fun","rank":281,"score":2.21}],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","mobile"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Postal","category":"compo","description":"My first LD entry.

There is 1 sector and 5 starbases to traverse. Beware of the space police, for they will take your credits if they win combat. You move with the mouse and input your commands with the keyboard. The goal is to amass 50000 credits to start your evil empire. Do you have what it takes to become a Space Pirate?\n\nFor those who want to turn off the music you can do so by pressing 'M', likewise you can press 'U' to turn it back on.\n\nNote: Incase its unclear on the instruction page, when you steal credits at a starbase its random as to the amount you'll get upto the amounts listed. Also I have noticed some quirks with the game but they shouldn't hinder gameplay. \n\nEnjoy the game!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/8c70adeff6872f5f45a71182bd14cd6b.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=6464","author":{"name":"KunoNoOni","uid":6464,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/66939357d6de2a9fee4036a08e714ad1?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/kunonooni/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/6464-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/6464-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/6464-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/6464-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/6464-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/6464-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/6464-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/6464-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/6464-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/6464-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53747017/Space%20Pirates%20-%20Villains%20of%20the%20Cosmos/SpacePirates.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/KunoNoOni/SpacePirates"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":52},{"area":"audio","rank":278,"score":2.68},{"area":"overall","rank":353,"score":3},{"area":"innovation","rank":460,"score":2.65},{"area":"mood","rank":466,"score":2.61},{"area":"fun","rank":507,"score":2.54},{"area":"humor","rank":530,"score":2.06},{"area":"theme","rank":538,"score":2.81},{"area":"graphics","rank":580,"score":2.35}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Stealther - The Great Heist","category":"compo","description":"A simple Stealth game.\nYou play as a thief who must steal a sacred artefact.\nAvoid the guards by sneaking past them.\nMove using WASD or Arrow Keys.\nThe game does include a Goat, but it is up to you to find it!\nConsidering my previous games, I find it pretty good.

Build your team of bad guys and send them on raids ! Steal a bus, kidnap the chief of police, etc. and raise the level of crime in the city until you can establish your reign of evil !\n\nBut beware, The Dark Cape and the cops will constantly stand in your way and try to catch you !\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHow to play - Quickly get started on the game !\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1 - Hire bad guys\n2 - Click \"raid\"\n3 - Choose an easy raid\n4 - Select people and launch the raid\n5 - See if you can cancel the effects of the encounters with your guys. (see below)\n6 - If you get to the end of the raid, you win money and crime points. You don't need to remove all the effects of the encounters.\n7 - You need 20 crime points to win\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWho should I hire ? - tips for choosing the BEST bad guys \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSTRENGTH : bad guys with a high strength can neutralize more encounters\n\nSKILLS THAT BOOST STRENGTH : They make a guy more flexible against encounters because you can spend $ if his strength is lower than the encounter's\n\nCANCEL SPELLS : Pay attention to the type. Some Cancel spells only allow you to cancel effects of a specific type of encounters.\nThere are 4 types of encounters : Heavies, Devices, Structures, Super-hero. You only have super-hero encounters on hard raid.\n\nFIND NEW GUYS : if the guys you can hire are weak, reset the panel !\n\nRAIDS : When you launch a raid, make sure your guys can cancel Heavies, Devices, Structures, and that they're strong enough or can boost their strength.\n\nK.O. : The guys are K.O. after a raid. They need to rest one night before they can fight again.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHow the battle system works\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe idea is to remove the effects of the encounters before you face them. The characters can use their \"Cancel\" spells if they have a strength superior or equal to the strength of the encounter and if they can cancel the right type of encounter. \n\nSelect a \"Cancel\" spell, then click on the button on the left of the effect you want to remove.\n\nIf you don't finish a raid, you can consult the encounters you've already seen to adapt your strategy.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDon't hesitate to ask if you don't understand something in the game.\nSorry for the very basic graphics, I didn't have time to work on them !\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/761faab6ba20acec6ead05a9ef54c5a0.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=11243","author":{"name":"Volute","uid":11243,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cb26260be4dbc326e231624878fd5e04?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/volute/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11243-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11243-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11243-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11243-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11243-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11243-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11243-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11243-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11243-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11243-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Play on web","url":"http://stormalligator.com/crime-in-the-city/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://stormalligator.com/villain/LD25_Villain.rar"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":91},{"area":"theme","rank":27,"score":4.1},{"area":"overall","rank":76,"score":3.61},{"area":"innovation","rank":149,"score":3.37},{"area":"graphics","rank":152,"score":3.57},{"area":"audio","rank":188,"score":2.96},{"area":"mood","rank":196,"score":3.12},{"area":"fun","rank":206,"score":3.17},{"area":"humor","rank":228,"score":2.95}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Cube Infection","category":"compo","description":"The game is complete.

You need to reach the GOLDEN cube by creating a control path to it.\nYou can SCAN the neighbors of BLUE / RED cubes by right-clicking on it. Neighbors will reveal their colors.\nYou can CONTROL the neighbors of a RED cube by left-clicking on it ONCE it has been scanned.\nYou can CREATE links by dragging your mouse between two cubes (only in a horizontal or vertical way).\n\nNotice :\n\n1) The content is randomly generated. That means sometimes, a game can't be won, and sometimes, it's too easy. 'Cause like a villain, life is unfair !\n\n2) Two actions can be made on the same case, the time counter will show only the last one (but both actions will occur).\n\n3) There's also a little bug that allow players to cheat. \nTry to find it ;)\n\nAbout the theme :\nI was not very inspired by the theme. You play an evil cube trying to infect the others. Maybe original, but I could have done far better !\n\nAbout the music : Made with MuLabs (Window, free version).\n\nAbout the graphics : Photoshop, some fonts from dafont and code only.\n\nAbout the light system : Inspired from an article on the SFML wiki.\n\nFeel free to ask anything !\n\nWindows notes : The game might not be able to run on old / integrated GPU (I use shaders). 64bits only; otherwise, please compile from the source with latest SFML revision\n\nLinux notes : You need SFMl to be installed on your system. 64bits only; otherwise, please compile from the source with latest SFML revision\n\nDev notes :\nSource code is awful.

Hopefully this still counts for LD48. ;)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/04d41c9f5fa42cb0b040a1f8a295e14f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=2023","author":{"name":"drakfyre","uid":2023,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/434ad30dfd03c0e5204cf9b6eda38930?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/drakfyre/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/2023-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/2023-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/2023-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/2023-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/2023-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/2023-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/2023-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/2023-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/2023-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/2023-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6741768/LD25Web/LD25Web.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6741768/LD25Web/LD25.zip"},{"label":"Time Lapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_rxKDAXOeQ&feature=BFp&list=PLlHjNcdoyw6VR5r71YnIws4gluonuH7TD"},{"label":"Videos and Tutorials","url":"http://www.cookingwithunity.com"}],"ratings":[{"area":"humor","rank":6,"score":4.27},{"area":"audio","rank":13,"score":3.82},{"area":"theme","rank":15,"score":4.26},{"area":"innovation","rank":92,"score":3.61},{"area":"mood","rank":163,"score":3.2},{"area":"overall","rank":219,"score":3.26},{"area":"fun","rank":226,"score":3.13},{"area":"graphics","rank":433,"score":2.78},{"area":"coolness","rank":912,"score":35}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"MechVillain","category":"compo","description":"Destroy your city with Dr. Mech Villain!\n\nFlixel\nPhotoshop\nGaragBand","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e112eac9d381691a583c5a885eff3223.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=2154","author":{"name":"nodoxi","uid":2154,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7ad1669740682a7d17a4e7c6fe15d243?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/nodoxi/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/2154-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/2154-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/2154-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/2154-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://nodoxi.org/ld25/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://nodoxi.org/ld25/MechVillain.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":52},{"area":"theme","rank":194,"score":3.59},{"area":"graphics","rank":200,"score":3.41},{"area":"humor","rank":257,"score":2.86},{"area":"fun","rank":274,"score":3.04},{"area":"mood","rank":341,"score":2.82},{"area":"overall","rank":353,"score":3},{"area":"audio","rank":358,"score":2.44},{"area":"innovation","rank":553,"score":2.46}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"MISSION 1","category":"compo","description":"!!NOTICE!!\nThis entry is not functional, much to my disappointment.

During a stormy night visions of a great drought hunt your dreams. \nYou wake up realizing you have only 200 days left to gather enough food or your citizens will starve and perish. In shock you speak to your advisors but they don't believe you. \n\nAre you willing to sacrifice the goodwill of your people in order to save them?\n\nAs it was foretold in your vision you must gather 5'000 counts of food before the end of 200 days in order to save your kingdom.\"\n\n\nInteraction:\n\nRight mouse click anywhere rotates the camera. You can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. There is no other interaction then the buttons on the interface.\n\nGameplay Instructions:\n\nTo win the game you must gather 5'000 counts of food within 200 days. Every NPC uses 1 food each day. So make sure you get enough food or else your citizens will starve and die. \nIf you keep your workers busy all the time (not giving them rest) they'll get angry and eventually stop working for you. You can force them back to work by using soldiers but soldiers are expensive. They cost you 2 gold every day.\nYou get gold from your non-working citizens. \n\nSo try to find a good balance between your resources and get your citizens to work. Even if that means you'll become the villain in their eyes. :) Thats basically it. I hope you enjoy playing it and let me know if you were able to finish the game. \n\nThanks for reading.

The list is randomly generated each play-through from the available items. If you succeed in completing a level, the next list will have more of the rare items on it, making the levels increasingly difficult to complete.\n\nWhen playing the game, you need to avoid being seen/detected by the house residents. If they see you directly, they will call for police support. If they detect you, they'll give you a warning. 3 warnings and the police are summoned. The police in the level will spend most of their time patrolling the roads. They can only hear within a certain range of the resident of the house, so if you time it right, they may not come at all! If they do give chase, try to hide. You can't outrun them for long, but if they lose sight of you, they may just get bored and wander off!\n\nI've made 5 tiers of items, ranging from super common (frequent spawns) yellow presents, up to extremely rare (red) items.\n\nThe game has been build in Unity 4.0 and so I've made builds for Web, PC, Mac and Linux.\n\n\nThe controls are:\nWASD/Cursors to move\nLeft Shift to run\nH to show the help menu explaining the present colours (rarity)\nL to see your shopping list and which items you need\nC to show the list of controls\n\n\nSince I'm a coder and Unity fan, I've spent most of my time making the game (about 20hrs) rapid prototyping in Unity and coding the patrol/navigation/present-spawning logic. In hindsight it was perhaps too big for a weekend project but I'm pleased with the result. I've tried to make the game look the best I can in the time frame. I'd never used Pixelmator to make assets before, so that's been a great learning experience! \n\nWell, if you read all that - thanks! I hope you enjoy the game! :)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d4555ba7b9e88603498dc564d4708c20.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=7513","author":{"name":"Cat Burton","uid":7513,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b60d19bc6c41cf0c465adcdaab4ae2a3?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/catburton/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7513-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7513-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7513-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7513-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7513-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7513-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1181377/LD48-BadSanta/Builds/BadSanta-PC.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1181377/LD48-BadSanta/Builds/BadSanta-Mac.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1181377/LD48-BadSanta/Builds/BadSanta-Linux.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1181377/LD48-BadSanta/Builds/BadSanta-Web/BadSanta.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1181377/LD48-BadSanta/BadSanta-UnityProject.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":57},{"area":"theme","rank":245,"score":3.47},{"area":"humor","rank":247,"score":2.89},{"area":"fun","rank":284,"score":3},{"area":"overall","rank":387,"score":2.94},{"area":"innovation","rank":495,"score":2.59},{"area":"mood","rank":553,"score":2.42},{"area":"audio","rank":607,"score":1.19},{"area":"graphics","rank":620,"score":2.22}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Behind Blue Pixels","category":"compo","description":"Please play my jam game as well: http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=19629\n\nIn this reverse shmup, you are an evil boss forced into the ship of the hero and thrown back in time. \n\nNow your own fleet is against you, and so is your past self. \n\nThe game is beatable.

Your aim is to.. smash.. things and.. wreak.. generic havoc. Take that, society.\n\nYou're a British Gangsta youth yob whose only aim is to misrepresent bears amongst the animal kingdom.\n\nIt takes place in some deranged puppet form. It's vaguely like a running game, except you have full control of your character's direction, attacks, dodges, equipped weapon, etc.\n\nThis video shows a gameplay clip, that shows you the way for killing most animals, if that's helpful:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijM7GhCjLBQ&hd=1\n\nA few tips to help you in the early bits:\nIf you hold down left click, you'll keep hitting.\nRight click/space (best for in the browser) dodges. You become invincible for a short time and jump back.\n\nEach bad guy has a strategy to defeat them.\n\nFor instance, edge towards pigs. They only follow you after you hit them once, and they have 2HP. If you start hitting them from as far away as you can, they'll come after you, but they'll die before you land a blow.\n\nFlamingos give SWAG, which is your health. They won't run until you attack them. Hit them in their middle and keep chasing to get them.\n\nBats can be hit on the middle of the wing, but can only hit from their body. The best way to take down a bat is to hit them twice, dodge and then hit again.\n\nBeavers, ostriches etc. should just be killed as fast as fast as possible. They won't land a blow if you let them come to you and hit at the right time.\n\nFor guys with guns, wait until it says BANG and then they tilt back. Just before they tilt back, when the BANG reaches the gun, dodge. If you dodge at the very end of your sin curve then you won't get hit.\n\nThey're easier once you have full SWAGGER and you go faster.\n\nFor bears and boars, land one blow then jump back, then another hit before they get close. Much easier once you have a baseball bat.\n\nDestroy bins with chainsaws and traps/beehives with a baseball bat to get extra SWAG too.\n\nThen lions and cyberdemons are just a case of.. run back and hit slowly.\n\nEver monster follows one of those path types, so you can extrapolate for the rest.\n\nSometimes it's about getting a nice path with a lot of SWAG materia, but ultimately it can be done just with great skill.\n\nList of creatures:\n\nGRASS SPAWNERS:\nSheep - Docile\nGoats (+1!)  - Kill these for SWAG.\nPunch Drunk Pigs - Policecop pigs who punch you.\nDark Knights - AKA bats. Should've called them Battymen in hindsight.\nOstriches - Swoop down.\nBaseball Bats.\nArmy Boars.\nBrown Bears.\nWide Load Pig - A pig with a pistol. Dodge when it says \"Bang\"\nFlyin' Lions - Masked superheroes\nRocket Boars - Use Rocket Launchers.\nCyberdemons - He's the chief of police.\nTrident Lions - If you meet one of these, you will die.\n\nPOND SPAWNERS:\nDucks - Docile\nFlamingos - Kill for SWAG\nFurry Beavers - Fast and annoying.\nChainsaw Beavers - ARGH. They do 3 damage.\nGlockodiles - Use shotguns. Not glocks. Pretty OP. Just like in IRL. Execpt without the whole.. shotgun.. thing.\n\nThere's also bear traps, bins and beehives that you can destroy with weapons for SWAG.\n\nMax out your SWAGGER bar to hustle. But don't get too cocky with it; you're not invincible.\n\nWhen you right click (or space) to dodge, you are temporarily invincible though, so that's useful, but it has cooldown.\n\nThe chainsaw does 3 damage, but it's pretty slow. The bat does 2 damage and has good range. The claws are really fast but have low range and only do 1 damage.\n\n#YOLO, but when you die you can REWIIIIIND to see how far you've come and restart the game. You'll also be told what killed you, how many kills you had and protips on beating what killed you.\n\nWith that in mind, I would absolutely love if you sent me a tweet if you got to a really spectacular monster or got particularly far. If people like this I might put a high score board on my site. @Vorpal_Games\n\nEach monster seems fair, especially given that you'll have new weapons, but you should think about what weapon you use and when to dodge. If you play for a while you can get really good at dodging everything.\n\nHope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed making it!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/49ac6ffd48216500988e79526339642d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=19499","author":{"name":"Alex Rose","uid":19499,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/eb679b7e8497bd73a0f457a389de49b4?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/alexrose/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19499-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19499-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19499-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19499-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19499-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19499-shot4.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19499-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19499-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19499-shot3.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19499-shot3.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://vorpal-games.com/Rude%20Bear.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.vorpal-games.com/rude-bear/WebPlayer.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":84},{"area":"humor","rank":9,"score":3.96},{"area":"graphics","rank":68,"score":3.89},{"area":"overall","rank":72,"score":3.45},{"area":"innovation","rank":78,"score":3.32},{"area":"mood","rank":90,"score":3.21},{"area":"fun","rank":94,"score":3.15},{"area":"audio","rank":101,"score":3.2},{"area":"theme","rank":190,"score":3.13}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"The \"Great\" British Weather","category":"compo","description":"Written in C# with XNA. Windows only I'm afraid.\n\nInstallation instructions:\n\n1. If you do not have XNA, or have not run an XNA game before, you will need this (very small) redistributable from Microsoft to run my game:\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914\n\n2. Double click \"The Great British Weather.exe\" in the zip folder, after you have extracted it!\n\n---\nDescription:\n\nYou take control of an every-day villain that any British person will know well: the weather!\nYou must attempt to make the crowd of festival goers have the worst possible time - without making them leave before the band's set ends!\nAfter all, you can't have any \"fun\" if no-one is about, right?\n\n---\nControls:\n\nAs the weather, you have the following at your control ([letter] indicates which key to press):\n\n[R]ain - Press the R key to start/stop a downpour of rain.\n         Everyone in Britain dislikes the rain. It rains a\n         lot however, so we don't mind it as much as some\n         other weather conditions.\n\n[S]torm - A few people hate storms. Really hate them. And,\n          to top it all off, if someone gets hit by \n          lightning, they will leave the festival straight\n          away!\n\n[W]ind - A lot of people can't stand the wind. In fact,\n         if someone gets blown over by the wind, they will\n         get really unhappy!\n\n---\nTips:\n\n1. People either dislike wind, or storms. Not both.\n2. People act as a multiplier, more people means bigger score!\n3. You need to find a balance between keeping everyone unhappy as long as possible, and not having them leave.\n4. If someone is jumping up and down, it means they are more than 50% happy! You should do something about that.\n5. The speech bubbles provide information on who dislikes what. People will talk about what they dislike (or that they're happy, if you aren't doing your job!)\n\nX. The wind blows the rain sideways. (Not really a tip, I just want someone to notice because it's pretty :D)\n\n---\nKnown Bugs:\n\n+ As far as I'm aware, the game itself is stable. I haven't managed to crash it in the last 6 hours.\n\n- HOWEVER: There is a huge issue with the compiled version of my game. DO NOT click off of the game window while playing. \n  After a few seconds of not being the active window, the game will hang (game logic and audio will continue to run, but the window will be non-responsive). This is not the fault of my code, but something XNA has done while compiling it. \n  It never, ever happens while debugging in Visual Studio. If anyone knows more about the AppHangB1 bug and XNA and can help me fix it I will be grateful. \n\n---\n\nThank you for checking my game out!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/4eef69d5f22c77f6fa2abffb3fbd4acb.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=17874","author":{"name":"bradleypollard","uid":17874,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c9d2014d97dba0a5de364b8c0b5c297a?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/bradleypollard/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17874-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17874-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17874-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17874-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17874-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17874-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17874-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17874-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17874-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17874-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/u2kdf6g75re4mns/The%20Great%20British%20Weather.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/bradleypollard/LudumDare-25"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SsaEmsWmUw"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":64},{"area":"innovation","rank":9,"score":4.26},{"area":"humor","rank":45,"score":3.69},{"area":"overall","rank":69,"score":3.63},{"area":"audio","rank":95,"score":3.33},{"area":"theme","rank":114,"score":3.78},{"area":"mood","rank":163,"score":3.2},{"area":"graphics","rank":166,"score":3.5},{"area":"fun","rank":174,"score":3.25}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"The Heroes' Menace","category":"compo","description":"Hello guys, I am in my 2nd LD#48 participation, and this the 2nd game I ever made.

It centers around the concept of the prisoner's dilemma where players, who have to interact to have a chance at winning, can also choose to backstab each other. In standard prisoner's dilemma fashion, if both play nice, both get out pretty OK. If both play mean, both lose. And if only one chooses to be mean, they make out really well.\n\nThis game is 100% multi-player with real humans and it is implemented as a server that can be connected to via telnet. There are tons of free telnet clients on the web including PuTTY and MushCLIENT. If you want to play, and you should, connect at\n\nAddress: endnet.publishingnothing.com\nPort: 2025\n\nBelow are copies of the three important help document pages that explain the story, game play overview, and how contracts work. Check them out if you are not yet sold.\n\nAlso, a session doesn't take forever (so you can't just win by playing longer than anyone else). Once your character makes its first contract, it has one real world hour to make as much money as possible. Don't want to play for an hour? Don't worry, try it out anyways. \n\nMy biggest fear is that there will not be enough players to really get this going so if you think this is interesting, please pass on the word so we can the evil villain empires rolling!\n\n--[Help - Story]------\nMoney. Its all about the damn money. To make everything \"fair\" it was decided\nin the year 2025 to make it so everyone had access to the trade markets. The\nproblem? You only get one shot. For one hour.\n\nEveryone is given a preset amount of cash and once you start trading, you have\none hour to make as much money as you can. Whats going on behind the trades?\nIt doesn't matter any more. Its just a system.\n\nOnce the hour is up, you'll still be able to connect to the system but you can\nno longer trade. No longer make more money. You failed? Whelp, your boned.\n\nDon't fail.\n\n--[Help - Game]------\nThe point of the game is to make money on contracts with a prisoner's dilemma\ntwist. Either or both of the players involved in a contract can choose to\nbackstab the other with the \"evil\" versions of the offer and accept commands.\nIf neither uses the evil version, both players profit. If both are evil, both\nloose everything invested as well as the contract slot for its duration. And\nif only one is evil, then they take all of the money for themselves. Whether\nor not you got screwed is not known until the contract is complete.\n\nSince you only have one hour to make as much money as you can, picking who you\nmake deals with and if you screw them over is paramount. To facilitate this\nplayers can chat globally (say) and privately (tell) and can see info about\nplayers (about).\n\nTo aid in this, a reputation system is in place. Each player starts with 10\nreputation. When a contract completes, both players involved can rate the\ncontract interaction in the range of -3 to +3. This is applied to the other\nplayer and is reflected on their public reputation where higher is better.\n\n--[Help - Contracts]------\nContracts are how you make money. To create a contract, one player makes an\noffer to another with the contract details. The other player can choose to\naccept or reject the contract. Once accepted the contract lasts the specified\nduration. Any one player can only have a maximum of 5 open contracts at a\ntime. The \"offer\" and \"accept\" have evil versions called \"eviloffer\" and\n\"evilaccept\", the effects of which are described in \"help game\".\n\nThe parameters of the offer commands are:\n  - offer <investment1> <player> <investment2> <duration>\n\ninvestment1 - The investment of the offering player\nplayer - The player you are making the offer to\ninvestment2 - How much the other player is supposed to invest\nduration - How long the contract lasts in minutes if accepted, max of 5\n\nProfit multipliers increase with duration. At 1 minute, each player makes\nback their investment plus the average of both investments and at 5 minutes\neach makes back their investment plus 16x the average of their investments!\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/684652e34f0244048afd096329779406.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=15756","author":{"name":"TheChemist","uid":15756,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bc0895cc8cf1649c807863736d1c994f?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/thechemist/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/15756-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/15756-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/chromex/gamejaming/archive/master.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1123,"score":14}],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Envious Farmer","category":"compo","description":"I know this game is terrible >.< But I wanted to actually post something for the solo ludum dare for once. \n\nThe idea is that you are a farmer that is very jealous of his neighbour, so he trains his sheep dog to kill sheep and sends it into the neighbouring fields..

And all you want to do is pee on stuff. \nDo it!\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nClick and hold your mouse where you want the dog to go to. Once close to fire hydrant, he'll pee on it. Score a bunch of points by not getting wet from the hydrant while you are peeing.\n\nABOUT:\nThis is an HTML5 game I made with Cocos2d-HTML5. It's the first time I used the platform. Other tools used: Audacity, Inkscape, CocosBuilder.\n\nTested on OSX 10.6.8, 10.8.2; Firefox 17.1, Chrome 23.0.1271.97\n\nBUGS/THINGS I WANTED TO DO/ETC:\n* Sound seems to only work in Chrome.\n* A little bit laggy (especially due to sound effect- see no sound version below).\n* Collision detection is a little off.\n* Dog can also remain 100% on the hydrant (collision detection doesn't stop you from moving).\n* The dog only pees in one direction.\n* The hydrants continuously spin, but you get hurt regardless if the water is facing you or not when you pee.\n* No end game condition (you can have negative health).\n* No way to mute sound effects / only 1 sound effect.\n* No music.\n* Only fire hydrants (no other entities to pee on).\n\nOVERALL:\n* I liked it a lot. If you read any of my blog posts, you'll see I had a major meltdown. In fact, on the first day, the only thing I had done was the different sprites in Inkscape. Everything I had to start from scratch... so I'm pretty pleased where I ended up, all things considered.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/02a1efb5ac99058f13148f914ce97c19.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=7737","author":{"name":"davidwparker","uid":7737,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b7964c02372a1218c65f4a679f9d78d5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/davidwparker/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7737-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7737-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (HTML5)","url":"http://davidwparker.com/ludumdare/ld25/"},{"label":"Web (HTML5) - No Sound","url":"http://davidwparker.com/ludumdare/ld25nosound/"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/davidwparker/ludum-dare-25"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":57},{"area":"humor","rank":272,"score":2.81},{"area":"innovation","rank":508,"score":2.55},{"area":"audio","rank":553,"score":1.57},{"area":"theme","rank":642,"score":2.47},{"area":"mood","rank":673,"score":2.1},{"area":"graphics","rank":682,"score":2.06},{"area":"overall","rank":752,"score":2},{"area":"fun","rank":756,"score":1.67}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Escape From Prison Planet","category":"compo","description":"STORY\n\nIn the year 2130, the Galactic Police began transporting all prisoners to the\nfirst planet, designed as a prison with no way out.\n\nEven Prison Planet 1 was not enough to contain the galaxy's most cunning villain.\n\nAfter starting a riot, you have slipped aboard Prison Transporter 1 after a fresh\ndelivery of in-mates, now you must get as far away from PP! as you can, or die trying!\n\nControls:\n\nW - Move up\nS - Move down\nA - Speed up\nD - Slow down\n\nSPACE - Activate shield\n\nMouse - Aim\nLeft - Fire guns\nRight - Fire missile.\n\nGameplay:\n\n - Avoid Asteroids, use missiles to destroy them\n - Destroy enemy spacecraft using your guns.\n - Steal cargo dropped by destroyed enemy spacecraft:\n   - [S] Shields - Recharges your shields.\n   - [M] Missiles - Recharges your missile launchers.\n   - [H] Hull Repair - Repairs damage to your hull.\n   - [B] Bomb - AVOID, this cargo is boobytrapped.\n\nGameplay Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVgqcm7ygKo&feature=youtu.be","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/7ee4f1c3d42b90127742e0a0a86f162b.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=7049","author":{"name":"gameXcore","uid":7049,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6e5d19e1d9020414a8de0eaa0c36e6aa?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/gamexcore/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7049-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7049-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7049-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7049-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7049-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7049-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7049-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7049-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7049-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7049-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows (Installer)","url":"http://code.google.com/p/ludum-dare-25-gxc/downloads/detail?name=EFPP%20-%20Submission.zip&can=2&q="},{"label":"Windows (No Install - Requires .net 4 & XNA)","url":"http://code.google.com/p/ludum-dare-25-gxc/downloads/detail?name=EFPP%20-%20Submission%20-%20No%20Install.zip&can=2&q=#makechanges"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://code.google.com/p/ludum-dare-25-gxc/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"graphics","rank":114,"score":3.72},{"area":"audio","rank":122,"score":3.19},{"area":"mood","rank":231,"score":3.04},{"area":"overall","rank":237,"score":3.23},{"area":"fun","rank":304,"score":2.96},{"area":"humor","rank":524,"score":2.07},{"area":"innovation","rank":603,"score":2.35},{"area":"theme","rank":621,"score":2.53}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Evil Death Robots Vs Bunnies","category":"jam","description":" === THOSE CUTE BUNNIES MUST DIIIIIEEEE!!!!111 ===\n\n* Play as a hoarde of evil death robots!\n* Blast any bunny that looks at you the wrong way!\n* Turn based strategy, watch out for the lethal BUNNYBOT!!\n\n----------------\n\n- Apols in advance that there aren't in-game instructions.

Unfortunately the game crashed several times, and I found out it was not my fault, but there's apparently some nasty bug in the text-output routine that is based on some code snippet from the NeHe website. So I decided to do a workaround and just output a bitmap indicating that you're in a hurry when the countdown reaches 30 seconds. Originally I planned to display number of current level, number of lives of the \"good\" character and clock. If anybody manages to find out what's wrong with the text-output routine, I'd be very grateful.

I probably wasted the first 12 hours just trying to think of a theme. I also had decided to sleep and not work myself up over this so, I probably got in between 8 - 10 hours each day I was working on this. Oh, I also retaught myself how to play piano, sampled my son for monster sounds, and cursed myself for only having FLStudio and Audacity installed. They got the job done, but compared to some of the audio tools I've used in the past they are pretty terrible.\n\nI was however pretty impressed with the Gimp and although I can't say the textures were fantastic, it held up much better than I had expected. \n\nI'm happy with my progress, but very disappointed that I hadn't created a level large enough to kill my i7 until I started working on level 3 and decided I should actually make it challenging. I don't think I would have been able\nto diagnose what was causing issues with crafty in the time needed anyways. \n\nSeems like most web based engines choke when you use are large number of block assets (mine are 16x16) which is one of the reasons I had ended up steering away from Three.js. Hopefully, I can figure out what I'm doing wrong before I attempt another one of these, or otherwise I might have to switch back to Java or .Net to keep things playable.\n\nFinally, this project has made me realize how much I miss doing this sort of work, and how good I could be at it if I got the time. I haven't done any serious recording in 6 years, nor have I done any serious image manipulation either.

The only problem is that the only one who can retrieve the orb is the \"Chosen One\". You find him outside the dungeon and pretend to help him get the orb.\n\nThis entry uses XNA but I used JSIL to convert it to javascript. It works in firefox or chrome. IE wouldn't load it at all and safari and opera had issues. There have been reports of Firefox being choppy with particles on the screen so if in doubt, use chrome.\n\nThis is a jam entry only because I ran out of time for the compo. All code and content was made by me during the 72 jam hours.\n\nTips:\nYou will need to fight Blake at the end to take the orb from him so don't let him get too powerful.\nAlso keep some extra equipment cards around for new allies at the end.\nYou can get rid of equipment cards you don't want, (Like extra copper short swords) by giving them to Blake. He will only equip items that are better than what he has.\nConversely, if Blake has a steel shield he may have a hard time hitting anything because he won't replace it with any swords in the game (bug). So try to keep him with two swords rather than giving him any shields.\nThe imp can't attack but he can block so he can get in the way of any nasties trying to get at Blake.\n\nUsed:\nVisual Studio - IDE\nC# - code\nXNA - code\nJSIL - conversion to javascript\nPhotoshop - graphics\nBFXR - sound effects\nAudacity - sound effects\nAutotracker - music\nTiled - tile maps","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/64118df38ffec30eb8e28313f04281de.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=1128","author":{"name":"Serilyn","uid":1128,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/67f74e549367f8a2f9364efc11aaaaa7?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/serilyn/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/1128-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/1128-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/1128-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/1128-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/1128-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/1128-shot2.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows (XNA)","url":"http://bitgriffin.com/LudumDare/GuardianAngelDevil/GuardianAngelDevil.zip"},{"label":"XNA Runtimes","url":"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914"},{"label":"Web (HTML5 - Chrome or Firefox)","url":"http://bitgriffin.com/LudumDare/GuardianAngelDevil/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":155,"score":2.92},{"area":"overall","rank":176,"score":2.96},{"area":"audio","rank":180,"score":2.67},{"area":"humor","rank":182,"score":2.47},{"area":"graphics","rank":209,"score":2.92},{"area":"theme","rank":211,"score":3.04},{"area":"fun","rank":223,"score":2.54},{"area":"mood","rank":224,"score":2.6},{"area":"coolness","rank":817,"score":42}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Horizon","category":"compo","description":"Call it divine intervention, call it a message from the gods, call it anything you want.\n\nCall it a hunch.\n\nSomething tells you what you've been looking for is here.

Just want to put that out there to begin with.\nAlso, the web version requires Unity plugin.\n\n\"This Is How It Ends\" features you, the villain, standing in the ruins of a world you have just finished destroying with your seventh act of destruction. You have the chance to journey back in time through each scene, watching the scenery revert to its state before each catastrophe. Re-discover your motives to realize how destroying the world could seem like the right choice. Read letters from those affected by you, and affecting you. And piece by piece, the outrageous ending becomes the natural conclusion. But if you venture too far, you risk being consumed by the darkness which taints your life.\n\nIf you encounter any bugs, please e-mail me at [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */ .\n\nThanks for playing!\n\n*edit* *possible spoilers*\n\n1.

Be warned that changing the default loadout of a ship makes each instance of that ship more expensive to produce!\n\nAll combat is done for you, so you can focus on resource management. I tried to add a lot of variety to the ships, upgrades, and perks to keep gameplay interesting and allow for a modicum of divergent play.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't get to add audio, which really hurts the game's appeal. Anyways, I hope you enjoy!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/81bd75a1e904099cb717f701166e19e8.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=18927","author":{"name":"nickworks","uid":18927,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/dc2ea893feac424549e50b02404e9b64?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/nickworks/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18927-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18927-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://npattison.com/projects/LD25/evile.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://npattison.com/projects/LD25/evile.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://npattison.com/projects/LD25/evile.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://npattison.com/projects/LD25/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://npattison.com/projects/LD25/evile-source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":60},{"area":"overall","rank":101,"score":3.53},{"area":"innovation","rank":109,"score":3.53},{"area":"fun","rank":128,"score":3.38},{"area":"theme","rank":210,"score":3.55},{"area":"humor","rank":499,"score":2.14},{"area":"mood","rank":539,"score":2.45},{"area":"audio","rank":607,"score":1.19},{"area":"graphics","rank":673,"score":2.08}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Fuck You, Player","category":"jam","description":"In this game, you are the level designer, and your objective it to kill as many players as possible by making the hardest level you can.

Music was made in SunVox, sprites made in SpriteSomething for ipad, program coded in MacVim. \n\n\nEdit: Added some additional screenshots, but I can't upload them for some reason, so they are here:\nhttp://www.markadkinshastings.com/?p=44","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/15baad1395a62cf6fba155e210a844ac.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=16660","author":{"name":"tokija","uid":16660,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/936d737eb2b14c48b6b0646da5b12e94?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/tokija/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16660-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16660-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source","url":"https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B_bL4s6UsL0gQWFCRzlrZFdwUEE"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1189,"score":0}],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Nosferatu","category":"jam","description":"Retro game (ZX Spectrum feeling).\nYou are the Count Orlok a.k.a Nosferatu; you can change your appearance, your size and your speed if you walk on the little red skulls.\n\nArrow keys to move\nX to start/skip the texts.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/1704f1166859e74d2ec1196b11840e28.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=12512","author":{"name":"jerombd","uid":12512,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/57b6a20a94514f00eabe56fdd8b952c6?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/juniorus/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/12512-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/12512-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/12512-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/12512-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/12512-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/12512-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/12512-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/12512-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.box.com/s/zex17tm4kecw0rc595es"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://www.box.com/s/myhrgy002g9p2lixid36"}],"ratings":[{"area":"mood","rank":12,"score":3.92},{"area":"graphics","rank":16,"score":4.41},{"area":"theme","rank":26,"score":4},{"area":"overall","rank":59,"score":3.52},{"area":"audio","rank":70,"score":3.38},{"area":"fun","rank":79,"score":3.23},{"area":"innovation","rank":94,"score":3.22},{"area":"humor","rank":144,"score":2.69},{"area":"coolness","rank":854,"score":40}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Overlord","category":"jam","description":"A small real-time strategy written with HTML5, Javascript, and Playcraft.js framework.\n\nPlot:\n\nYou're the evil Overlord, and you should expand your possessions.

Feels just like the handheld consoles of the 90's. The poor thing only has 256KB of storage, 8KB of RAM and a 16MHz processor.\n\nOne of the reasons I have submitted to the jam is that (almost)no one will be able to play this because of the hardware required. For that reason I humbly ask you to rate this game based on the gameplay video. Please forgive the shaky camera and glitchy screen. The glitches are due to a low quality rubber contact between LCD and PCB, it's not my code's fault. And yeah, I suck at this game XD\n\nInstructions to assemble the hardware are included with the source, along with all Arduino libraries needed.

Even if you crush him, like all heroes of video games worldwide, he respawn on the left screen (with his vicious 1UP).\n\nLast think, be a good villain, make the best score and enjoy :)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/bcea52759d4559ca9fab886a2f8561b0.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=19387","author":{"name":"Lyonsbanner","uid":19387,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9ebd8811364f26a688ea2701eda3c784?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/lyonsbanner/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19387-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19387-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19387-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19387-shot1.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://stationblanche.free.fr/LudumDare/25/Tripe_Traps.php"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ozb3zxdmffxxs6s/U-pfEV5pDO/Tripe%20Traps.php"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":77},{"area":"humor","rank":244,"score":2.91},{"area":"fun","rank":335,"score":2.89},{"area":"theme","rank":376,"score":3.19},{"area":"mood","rank":485,"score":2.57},{"area":"overall","rank":490,"score":2.76},{"area":"audio","rank":592,"score":1.29},{"area":"innovation","rank":645,"score":2.25},{"area":"graphics","rank":673,"score":2.08}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Wandering ViIllain","category":"jam","description":"Wander the procedurally generated countryside killing cylinders and burning trees.\n\nTo run:\nDownload, extract, and open the WanderingVillain file\n\nIf you have performance issues run it in the smallest window size or disable outlines.\n\nIf you have a Mac or a Linux machine and are able to compile a love game for it, I would appreciate the help.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a4bbd58c5a3ae85cc98f2d922adcb08d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=1168","author":{"name":"Almost","uid":1168,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f37053bbe94a610ef74b8b98d38b6cc6?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/almost/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/1168-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/1168-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/1168-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/1168-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/1168-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/1168-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/1168-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/1168-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows (2MB)","url":"http://www.almostmatt.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/WanderingVillain.zip"},{"label":".love (20kb)","url":"http://www.almostmatt.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/WanderingVillainLove1.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":80,"score":3.77},{"area":"mood","rank":242,"score":2.5},{"area":"overall","rank":244,"score":2.69},{"area":"fun","rank":244,"score":2.42},{"area":"innovation","rank":253,"score":2.46},{"area":"theme","rank":255,"score":2.69},{"area":"coolness","rank":1048,"score":22}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Weapons of Mass Construction","category":"compo","description":"**MADE A FEW QUICK CHANGES TO LEVELS FOR LESS OP AND MORE MINDBOGGLING STUFF, PLAY \"FIXED\" VERSION FOR THESE CHANGES***\n\nAlso, make sure to read the post-mortem! http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/12/19/weapons-of-mass-construction-a-post-mortem/\n\nYou are a malevolent god who wants to stop all good guys in the world.\n\nThe good guys have gotten lazy and have created a robot to do the work for them: the Heroic Emulated Redeemer Object (or H.E.R.O. for short.)

Alternatively, you also have the option to \"bleed\" your enemy out by capturing bases and defending them.  If you capture an enemy base (the little wells/oasis in the forests), you receive an extra unit.\n\nThe first party to reach 0, or lose all units, loses the game.\n\nThe game is turn-based. That means you move all your units, finish your turn (press Enter), wait for the enemy's move and then it's back to you. \n\nIf you get stuck, try a few different strategies. The game should be relatively easy to beat.\n\nTheme\n*******\nUnfortunately I didn't have enough time to fully develop the theme. But the basic idea is, that we as humans are Nature's Villain.

In the Mayan Long Count, the date is 13.0.0.0.0, and it is time for the Mayan Hordes to emerge from their slumber and bring an end to civilization as we know it.\n\nAnd it's up to you to lead the Mayan Hordes, beset upon all sides by modern diseases, the Resistance, shoddy stonemasonry, and the occasional meteorite.\n\n-\n\nYes, maybe I was a little too enamored of the End Of The World theme. But I've been meaning to make a globe-view end-of-the-world game (a la Pandemic, Fate Of The World, Defcon et al) for a while now, and I thought, why not. At least this way you get to extend your villanous schemes across whole continents.\n\nStarts off nice and easy, unless the random number generator hates you. But don't get too complacent, the fun really begins once you've got a few more pyramids built.\n\nThis game was put together in 48 hours, but it was the *wrong* 48 hours (Sunday-Monday), so it's a Jam entry. And my sound card's been playing up, so you'll have to make do with a Silent Edition (sorry). \n\nAnd yeah, I apologise for the lack of post-apocalyptic goats.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n--- Instructions ---\n\nOkay, so a few people have asked for a more detailed description of what you're meant to be doing. \n\nYou are the leader of the Mayan Horde. Your aim is to subjugate the people of Earth, and to build six pyramids across the world.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen, you'll see some statistics. These tell you how much Logistics points you have, and how serious the various threats to your Mayan Horde are.\n\nOver time, different events will happen - these events will generally be an outbreak of disease among your forces, an act of the Resistance against you, or a threat to your Mayan stonemasonry. You can choose either to Take Action, which will cost you one Logistics point, or to do nothing. If you have no Logistics points, then the Take Action button will do nothing.\n\nMost of the time ,taking action will stop things from getting any worse, while doing nothing has a chance that things will escalate.\n\nAs disease spreads / Resistance increases / stonemasonry gets more shoddy, the number of events happening increases. At the start of the game, you'll probably have enough Logistics points to take care of everything (I never did get that difficulty curve quite how I'd like it). As the game goes on, you'll have to start making tougher and tougher choices about where your energy is best spent.\n\nEvery so often, you'll have a chance to build new pyramids. Each pyramid increases the range of your dominion, and also gain you a few more Logistics points, but also increases the number of Events you'll have to cope with, so choose carefully.\n\nLeft click selects, right click rotates the camera. The time controls at the top are Pause / 1x / 3x / 10x speed.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/183f9414e47b6114980c77fc6c2fd8cf.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=11718","author":{"name":"PTSnoop","uid":11718,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f3b6008ea44f8f5f14c174d1f1e8413a?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/ptsnoop/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11718-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11718-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://sasha.sector-alpha.net/~ptsnoop/ConquestOfTheMayans/ConquestOfTheMayans_Win.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://sasha.sector-alpha.net/~ptsnoop/ConquestOfTheMayans/ConquestOfTheMayans_Mac.app"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://sasha.sector-alpha.net/~ptsnoop/ConquestOfTheMayans/ConquestOfTheMayans_Lin.zip"},{"label":"Web (Unity)","url":"http://sasha.sector-alpha.net/~ptsnoop/ConquestOfTheMayans/Web/Web.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://sasha.sector-alpha.net/~ptsnoop/ConquestOfTheMayans/ConquestOfTheMayans_Src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":64},{"area":"innovation","rank":72,"score":3.38},{"area":"graphics","rank":172,"score":3.15},{"area":"mood","rank":201,"score":2.7},{"area":"overall","rank":205,"score":2.85},{"area":"humor","rank":209,"score":2.26},{"area":"theme","rank":255,"score":2.69},{"area":"fun","rank":263,"score":2.31},{"area":"audio","rank":266,"score":1.33}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Considered Harmful","category":"compo","description":"Written in C++ with the c standard library. My first text adventure game. There are no dependencies, so play around with the source to your heart's content, compile it for whatever you want. Oh, and if anyone asks, I did not tell you that programming like this is okay.\n\nYou play the Marshal of Darkness as he escapes from his own dungeon, committing acts of villainy to procede, against the heroes and his own treacherous minions.\n\nHe does not like fair fights, but backstabbing and murdering helpless people is his idea of a good time.\n\nHints for the perplexed:\n-movement is always in the four cardinal compass directions (or 'down', in one specific case). The exits from a room are listed in the room description. So, to follow a 'passage to the east', type 'move east'.\n\n-This game has a lot of hints built into it. The 'look' command is your tool here. It will give you not only visual info but also your character's insight. Also, some items can only be seen this way\n\n-There is one place very early on where you must wait to obtain an item. Type in a couple of junk commands to pass time.\n\n-It is possible to use weapons in such a way that will later come back to bite you. All weapons are limited use, so be careful.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/453ef4b866de89e13c0bff77e305a73f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=12979","author":{"name":"shieldofvalour","uid":12979,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b84e367239f249f4dd7c01f447157aba?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/shieldofvalour/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/12979-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/12979-shot0.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/75072702/consideredharmful.rar"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/75072702/consideredharmful.cpp"}],"ratings":[{"area":"mood","rank":245,"score":3},{"area":"theme","rank":519,"score":2.86},{"area":"innovation","rank":601,"score":2.36},{"area":"fun","rank":633,"score":2.21},{"area":"overall","rank":644,"score":2.43},{"area":"coolness","rank":1048,"score":22}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"End Boss","category":"compo","description":"Written in C# with XNA \n\nAren't bullet hell bosses the coolest thing ever!?

I made this game in less than 20 hours, after starting over three times. I wasn't satisfied with my previous ideas, this one seemed at least interesting to me.\n\nI know this isn't finished. The only end is when you get tired of the FPS getting lower and lower as you complete phases. There isn't any real challenge either, as you have infinite \"lives.\" I failed at adding goats as well, they may replace the blue balls in the post-compo version though.\n\nYou will have to play with Chrome or Chromium in order for the audio to be working, because other browsers don't support the Web Audio API yet. I would greatly appreciate it if you don't rate 0 in Audio just because you don't hear any audio. The sound is important for other categories as well, so I thank you very much if you make an effort to play in Chrome (assumimg you're not a regular user, that's cool if you are). :)\n\nAnyway, please play, rate and comment my game, and I will check and rate and comment yours!

I'm Zanzlanz and this is my second Ludum Dare entry, \"Dragon Boss.\" :D\n\n__________________________________ TL;DR _________________________________\nRead this if you don't feel like reading the rest:\nMove with arrow keys, use shift to breath fire, and space to pick up animals. Avoid arrows. Collect items until you win. I had fun and loved talking to my live stream viewers. There are goats, and they are yummy.\n\n__________________________________ INFO __________________________________\nWow you went passed the TL;DR.  Thank you :)\n\nSo the whole game is based off of you being a dragon.  You main goal is to become a boss.  In order to become a boss, you can terrorize the giant village filled with archers, cows, and GOATS.\n\nI created all music, graphics, (most of) the code (I submitted an ugly engine before it started), and sound effects in the allotted time of 48 hours.  The art is actually made up of 13 colors, total, so I think that's a cool feature!  My live stream adds up to over 17 hours of video.  \n\n________________________________ CONTROLS _______________________________\n- WAD or arrow keys to move.  Keep tapping up (or W) to fly.\n- Shift: Hold down shift to breath fire.  Fire can burn down houses or catch people/livestock on fire.\n- Space: When there is a person or livestock under you, press space to pick it up.  Press space again to drop it.  If they take fall damage, they die and give you goodies.\n\n______________________________ WIN CONDITION _____________________________\nSimply, if you're completely leveled up, you win.\nYou can be leveled up in speed, flight, and flame.  The highest level for each category is 10!\n\n________________________________ ENTITIES _______________________________\nAll entities can be picked up and thrown on the ground.  They all drop meat, hearts, and 2 experience orbs.\n- Archers: They're the villagers.  They all have bows and arrows because they are paranoid.  They'll squat before they shoot an arrow at you.  So watch out :D\n- Cows and goats: They're just there because they're yummy.\n\n____________________________ DRAGON PROPERTIES ___________________________\nOn the display is health, hunger, experience, and your power (speed, flight, and flame).\n- Health: If it goes to 0, you die.\n- Hunger: Decreases over time.  Determines how fast your stamina replenishes.\n- Stamina: It's how much energy you have to do things, such as fly and breath fire.  It will automatically increase over time.  It will decrease if you use up your strength.\n- Exp: Every 200 exp, you gain power in one of the 3 categories (speed, flight, and flame).\n\n_______________________________ TIME LAPSE _______________________________\nI livestreamed this whole thing (including me write this D:), and I was able to make it into a timelapse!  See the links at the top for the video.\nI must give a huge shout out to the people who watched my live stream.  There were awesome to chat with, and it was nice meeting new friends.\n\n___________________________ POST-COMPO GAME ______________________________\nI am working on finishing the game that will fix bugs, improve graphics, and add REALLY COOL features.\nI'll post it on Ludum Dare when I'm done, of course. One of the new features is the dragon will grow over time.

The maps are done in two layers, one for background tiles like grass and flowers, and a second that represents objects that can block pathfinding.\n\nThere are 5 levels that you can select from on an overworld fantasy map, with a bonus level that is randomly generated.\n\nThis is a turn based strategy game that uses the a-star pathfinding AI algorithm as the base mechanic. Two lovers are randomly placed in the terrain and your job is to spawn new walls in such as way that instead of walking closer to each other for a tender reunion, our intrepid lovers are driven farther and farther apart.\n\nThe strategy here is that you can't make it completely impossible for them to reach each other. A true villainous spirit wants to have them never lose all hope - to never give up - but to experience the heartbreak of a love that is just out of reach.\n\nI hope you like it!

On this screen, make sure that there is an entrance, an exit, and rooms connecting all of the treasures. The heroes must be able to get through to the end. Press the Start Game button, unpause it by pressing the Pause toggle button, and watch as nothing interesting happens. I'm not even sure why I made the game start paused, really.\n\nI knew early on that I had taken on something a bit too much for three days. It's my first Ludum Dare entry, and my artist's first time doing game art. I knew I couldn't make blog posts without making it impossible to complete. The game is entirely JavaScript/Canvas, using no libraries or engines, and all code was written during the competition period aside from a snippet of unused audio code.\n\nThat said, it isn't done. It \"plays\" in the sense that the game will finish. Combat is supposed to be present, but isn't. You make a dungeon, then just watch as the hero party walks through it from treasure room to treasure room, then finally to your lair where you would normally fight them.\n\nI'm very proud of what we accomplished, even if there is still a lot of work left to do. Development will continue. The code is not obfuscated. The Windows link will download a .zip file containing all assets for \"playing\" standalone, but it will run in Chrome. Firefox and IE10 are also supported, but have a small image tiling error.\n\nThe submitted version may have a number of compatibility glitches, including an odd problem with playing the game in a tall (as opposed to wide) window that somehow made it in.\n\nLicense: source provided and not obfuscated, feel free to learn from it, but don't steal the game.

He'll do whatever it takes to win the respect and adoration of every person on Earth - even if he has to KILL EVERY PERSON ON EARTH.\n\nTake Dr. Vile and his AI companion, Lexe, on a quest to build the most powerful Death Ray mankind has ever seen. Will Dr. Vile use it for good or will the villain always be the villain?\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n- Use the arrow keys to move Dr. Vile.\n- Press X to swing your bat (perfect weapon for an evil genius, eh?). Your bat can bash objects - such as trees, cars, TVs, and more - that will break into the parts you need to complete the Death Ray. Use your bat to break the skulls of any pesky townspeople, too! \n- Press C to use your Stun Gun. This will temporarily stun townspeople (probably why it's called a Stun Gun). It does have a cooldown period, though! \n- Press SPACE BAR to open/close the Inventory menu and see what parts you need to complete the Death Ray. This also pauses the game.\n- Try not to die or you'll have to start over! Collect Apples and Leftover Steak to regain health.\n\n\"Dr. Vile in The Greater Good\" is Green Pixel's first Ludum Dare submission! We're used to creating months-long projects so we're amazed at what can be done in 72 hours!

Almost Xmas, too! Anyways, it's been very rough this time for us, we've aimed too high (does anyone aim too low in LD?) but I think we've finally achieved enough to be satisfied with the result. \n\nSurely, those sprites aren't beautiful at all (but hey, at least they're all animated in 8 directions, imagine the pain), the tile-set quality (specially on corners) causes eyebleed and you could probably find better gameplay and less bugs in the old E.T. games now buried in the desert, but we made it!\n\nLet's sum it up!\n\n-------------Story---------------\n-You are a knight, bound to kill a witch in a sealed cave. Why? Maybe you need money and her head is valuable, maybe you are bored and you love wet places, or maybe you just are that evil and violent!\n\n-However, she curses you. What's the curse? You gotta find out! And then.. ask yourself: does the curse even bother you? Or will you grow used to it?\n---------------------------------\n\n------------Gameplay---------------\n-You can move in 8 directions (wow, talk about dimensions!). The plan is that your mouse points your way (AKA you should hit and block aiming at the enemy!) and you can use 'A' to walk in that direction, 'S' to block the attack (ah, but there's a cooldown, of course) and 'LMB' to attack (you can charge this attack for uber-happiness).\n\n-It's an action-game intended to avoid the button mashing of Hack&Slash games by providing you with a block and slash/charge skill. The ranged attack was meant to be meant to be, but sadly it never reached the actual 'meaning to be' phase, so you'll have to sue us for that!\n-----------------------------------\n\n---------Team---------------\nsoy_yuma - Game coder\nandrew - Engine coder\nrethen - Graphics and sounds\n----------------------------\n\n------Special thanks-------------------------------\nLaura - For all that coffee and the title screen!\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nHope you enjoy the game as much as we've enjoyed making it!

stress!!)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/0dd8e909b2865c113d632b2aa14d33ad.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=7620","author":{"name":"soy_yuma","uid":7620,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f339ffbf97b47df1c32d5b22b69fdfbd?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/soy_yuma/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7620-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7620-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7620-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7620-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7620-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7620-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.sismicos.net/merlot/merlot-v1.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.sismicos.net/merlot/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":96,"score":3.65},{"area":"overall","rank":163,"score":3},{"area":"mood","rank":182,"score":2.75},{"area":"innovation","rank":196,"score":2.7},{"area":"fun","rank":232,"score":2.5},{"area":"theme","rank":264,"score":2.63},{"area":"coolness","rank":831,"score":41}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"uSlender","category":"jam","description":"You

You can also win faster by playing by the rules of a japanese GO-MOKU (five-in-a-row). \nThe green fields will (post-compo)be an impassable areas, nothing wil be allowed to be placed on them.\n\nBy pressing a \"red\" button we will be transferred to the PENTE game's board, which is the same as a geographical map that will be used for the RTS gameplay.\nFor now there are two red buttons, so you can play on two different PENTE games at the same time.\n\nArresting is closing two enemy's figures from both sides, such us: XOOX. After arresting, enemy's forces are weakened by two soldiers. When he will lose 10... this means VICTORY for us :)\n\n2 RTS This game's element is not yet ready. By pressing a \"green\" or \"blue\" button we will be transferred on a board of our game, where our squads, (Alpha, Beta, Charlie and Delta squads) of Imperial Stormtroopers fight the historic army controlled by Napoleon Bonaparte. However for now we can't anything on this map :)\n\nWhen we win by thinking tactically on a PENTE board game, our army on the RTS board win as well.\n...unfortunately we didn't have enough time to fully finish our game... We have got all the Stormtroopers' and Napoleon's soldiers' animations ready. They will be able to fight each other later (post-compo).\n\n(The orders in game is a voice of our sound designer, apart from Napoleon's \"French\" accent ;)\n\nENJOY!\n\nTeam Something Beautiful\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/f36021600917660bfdaa0b4e199c7abc.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=17653","author":{"name":"somethingbeautiful","uid":17653,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0a96b18da2c82c301114b44e9cff785b?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/somethingbeautiful/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17653-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17653-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17653-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17653-shot1.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://ultrashare.net/hosting/fl/8e5615eb28/all"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"innovation","rank":141,"score":2.98},{"area":"graphics","rank":144,"score":3.31},{"area":"humor","rank":156,"score":2.64},{"area":"audio","rank":159,"score":2.81},{"area":"mood","rank":227,"score":2.58},{"area":"overall","rank":233,"score":2.74},{"area":"theme","rank":251,"score":2.74},{"area":"fun","rank":253,"score":2.37}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Cookie Caper","category":"compo","description":"This was an amazing effort.

After your last minion (5 minions total) the hero will spawn, be careful, this hero has the ability to randomly kill one of your minions at the start. Use your Left Mouse Button to control your minions by pushing the arrow keys on the side of the screen. You can move your minion by clicking the move then arrow keys in which direction you wish to send it. You can attack by clicking the attack button and clicking an arrow to choose which direction. Caution, you can only do one attack per minion and when you decide to do an attack you can't move that minion until the next go. Click end turn to move to the last minion, or if you are at the last one, then it will be the hero's turn. The hero is so quick that your turn will come up very soon after clicking end turn on your last minion, watch what minion you are on.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/21d46868cf5b376ca8800d5031dfffd6.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=16338","author":{"name":"surpy","uid":16338,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/59067a607c8bbd2b1b530f93585d6ade?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/surpy/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16338-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16338-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16338-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16338-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16338-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16338-shot2.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/y7m93wcsgikfw6z/DM%27s%20Rule.zip"},{"label":"Windows (No Installer)","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/5kjd6hhyfumkcdq/DM%27s%20Rule%20%28No%20Installer%29.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/vxwrrubaw0qn8rs/DM%27s%20Rule%20Source%20Code.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":54},{"area":"theme","rank":579,"score":2.67},{"area":"innovation","rank":625,"score":2.3},{"area":"humor","rank":702,"score":1.4},{"area":"mood","rank":733,"score":1.58},{"area":"fun","rank":746,"score":1.74},{"area":"overall","rank":752,"score":2},{"area":"graphics","rank":760,"score":1.36}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"DONUT HEIST: Nom in 60 Seconds","category":"compo","description":"You are Boris! \nThe Greatest Donut Thief in the World!\n\nCollect ALL the donuts then escape!\nArrows to move, space to jump.\n\nEDIT: For the record the 1st (and only) level is possible to beat.

I'll be telling a 12-part story wrapped around nonsensical minigames... Much like this game.\n\nDespite that, obviously as per the rules, I didn't work on or plan ANY of this before this weekend (Do you really think I'd PLAN something as ludicrous as this?). I just sort-of made it up as I went along, as I tend to do.\n\nSo basically, there are three minigames, all of which require the use of a mouse. I really don't suggest trying to play it with a trackpad. That'd be torturous. But I mean, if you're one of those 'hardcore gamer' types, then go ahead.\n\nI'm not even going to give you instructions for any of them, because they're REALLY easy to figure out and you can't technically 'lose', so just kinda keep going until you get it.\n\nI will, however, give you some tips, in case you get stuck.\n\nGame 1: The point at which you have to move the mouse is actually REALLY small, so find it and then just kinda wiggle your hand a bit.\n\nGame B: There's a point in the middle of the road where you can just sit and complete the whole game. But y'know, put some effort in, first.\n\nGame Tres: This IS possible. I know it seems devilishly difficult, but your collision box is actually smaller than you think it is.\n\nAlso, the theme won't make much sense unless you actually FINISH the game, so don't go giving me one star just because you got stuck on one of the minigames. Not that you'd do anything of the sort, of course. You're lovely, you.\n\nThink that's it. Sorry about the horrible patchwork I had to do to cover the crash. Flash apparently doesn't like resetting the location of the mouse pointer, so I have to ask YOU to do it. You don't mind, do you? No, of course not. You're lovely, you!\n\nEDIT: Bugfix.

I loved the theme and had a lot of cool ideas but I went with this. You're bank robbers trying to escape from the police. \n\nI said after LD24 that I would never make another randomly-generated game again... but there I went again this time, doing it again. I regretted it in the end, haha.\n\nIt has some bugs, needs a lot of polish, sounds, and a menu,  but the deadline was creeping up on me and so I just put it in a playable \"finished\" state. Didn't really want to move it to the Jam since this week has been so busy anyway, I didn't want to take more time out of yet another day.\n\nOverall, I had a lot of fun, as always. I just wish I could've kept it simpler/been more prepared. I meant to create a warmup game this time to be prepared for the style of game I was going to make for LD25, but I'm afraid busy life didn't let me do that.\n\nAnyway, here it is. I'm certainly going to try to make a post-compo update to this game, since I have so many great ideas, so we'll see!\n\n\nControls: \nLeft mouse: Shoot\nRight mouse: Boost (Press once, don't hold. A tiny bug I didn't get to tackle lets you hold it and it looks like you're boosting but you're not anymore)\n\nGoal: Last as long as you can, score as much as you can (by shooting the police). \nBoost through the road blocks.\n\n\nTerribly ugly UI, I know. But again, I just shifted my focus to making it playable instead of shiny things like a nice UI.\n\nScore is at the top, best score is to the right of that. Under the score is your health. Under that is the boost. Should be self-explanatory aside from that. \n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/89ce119000b51d23080b299b95632ab1.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=7354","author":{"name":"CaptainIcy","uid":7354,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/661c17772e9f934610f8c0c4abfa1cef?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/captainicy/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7354-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7354-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7354-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/7354-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51004934/LD25/Finalforcompo/FinalWinForCompo.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51004934/LD25/Finalforcompo/BankRobbersWeb.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51004934/LD25/Finalforcompo/Assets.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":617,"score":2.23},{"area":"theme","rank":630,"score":2.5},{"area":"innovation","rank":701,"score":2.07},{"area":"fun","rank":711,"score":1.92},{"area":"overall","rank":770,"score":1.67},{"area":"coolness","rank":990,"score":28}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Cell 22","category":"jam","description":"UPDATE: I made a mistake while uploading the post-compo version.

Goat is upset because no one ever gives him any gifts. He hatches a villainous plan to eat everyone's gifts, therefore ruining Christmas. The governmental hears of this dastardly plot, and sends in a veritable army of robots to stop him. \n     The game plays as a platform shooter. It is an arcade game, so there really is no way to win. Instead you can get the high score,which is then submitted. See your name at the top of that list (if your good).\n     The worlds that Goat plays in are generated, so you never play the same game twice. \n     I hope you enjoy your gift-eating-spree, and may you eat Christmas many times over (XD)\n\nNote: The game does take a while to load. My apologies. The world generator could have used a few optimizations to make it go quicker, but I just didn't have time. I was also using an interpreted language (gml), so it wasn't at optimal speed. Once the game does load (which takes around 30 seconds to a minute) it should run at somewhere between 35-100 fps most of the time (the game updates 35 times a second, so you wont notice any slowdowns unless you go below 35 fps) The loading screen is static, so if it seems like its frozen, it likely is not.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/69a71004fc8f818f6a48e6e28d0a5f89.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=18228","author":{"name":"lando walters","uid":18228,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4470c2000db6e9a005571fdaa6f43e02?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/lando-walters/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18228-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18228-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18228-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18228-shot1.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.box.com/s/cre4dmefgqwfu20jc3cz"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://www.box.com/s/nl5dqgdl4m21jf3z550j"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":51},{"area":"fun","rank":247,"score":3.08},{"area":"humor","rank":280,"score":2.78},{"area":"overall","rank":397,"score":2.92},{"area":"theme","rank":423,"score":3.08},{"area":"audio","rank":425,"score":2.21},{"area":"mood","rank":495,"score":2.55},{"area":"innovation","rank":553,"score":2.46},{"area":"graphics","rank":658,"score":2.12}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"The TIme Master","category":"compo","description":"You are an entrepreneurial super villain that has found the key to Time.

I tried to get it working as an applet, but it just wouldn't work, sorry!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/0c56602a66d63a8262af3d679d5db383.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=17950","author":{"name":"danielcmessias","uid":17950,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/131d00762720afe148b58cf46b4930f2?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/danielcmessias/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17950-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17950-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17950-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17950-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows/Mac/Linux","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?ps80n199mn45is7"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?vms71a3nnqv1bla"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nYR7eiOjeI"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":170,"score":3.65},{"area":"audio","rank":248,"score":2.77},{"area":"innovation","rank":301,"score":3},{"area":"graphics","rank":380,"score":2.91},{"area":"humor","rank":456,"score":2.25},{"area":"mood","rank":495,"score":2.55},{"area":"overall","rank":555,"score":2.65},{"area":"fun","rank":584,"score":2.33},{"area":"coolness","rank":776,"score":45}],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Captain Iago","category":"compo","description":"My game is unfinished.

I completed all my objetives, almost didn't broke anything and I'll overall satisfied with the final result. So, here it is!\n\nYou play as HitlerZilla, a GenericZilla monster with Hitler's brain and your mission is just defeat as many enemies as possible. Looks easier than it is!\n\nI didn't have the time to properly implement increasing difficulty, but I think that even with fixed values the game is enjoyable. Just wait for the soldiers, tanks and even planes at bout 30 seconds into the game, be patience :)\n\nHOW TO PLAY:\n* Mouse: Look and move around. Also aim with the small circle mark.\n* Left mouse button: Fire! but beware, it's limited!\n* Space: Jump and damage everything around! The damage area is delimited with the bit white circle. This power needs a bit of time for recharging.\n* Look down and check those huge feet! Step on those little mortals! \n\nThe original controls were using the right mouse button for jumping, but Unity player pops up the menu, lucky us, the space key is also mapped to jump :)\n\nI hope you enjoy the game! First of all because I think it's a nice game and second because my last LD48 entry was a bit misunderstood and not many people got through the first mini-game, even after posting a video showing how to play! I think this one is easier to have fun with.\n\nIn the next days I'll upload Windows, OSX and Linux versions. but I'm so tired right now (3:00am)... just need to sleep... I'll try not to check many games :)\n\nEDIT: Forgot to say that the source code lacks the NGUI and RageSpline packages, as they are commercial plugins and I don't think it's ok to re-distribute them :P\n\nEDIT #2: I added the Win/OSX/Linux \"combo\" versions. I only tested OSX. Will test Linux later. Can't test Windows version.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/2666a7e578047d2e4664188faa09008c.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=5049","author":{"name":"DavidErosa","uid":5049,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/21de20b393f84384a101dcf6bb21e0be?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/derosa/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/5049-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/5049-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/5049-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/5049-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/5049-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/5049-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/5049-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/5049-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/5049-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/5049-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (Unity player)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9960039/ld25/HitlerZilla/HitlerZilla.html"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9960039/ld25/LD25_exports/Windows/HitlerZilla_windows.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9960039/ld25/LD25_exports/Linux/HitlerZilla_Linux.tar.bz2"},{"label":"OSX","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9960039/ld25/LD25_exports/OSX/HitlerZilla_OSX.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9960039/ld25/source/HitlerZilla_Unity_src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":71},{"area":"humor","rank":84,"score":3.49},{"area":"theme","rank":110,"score":3.79},{"area":"audio","rank":194,"score":2.94},{"area":"overall","rank":276,"score":3.15},{"area":"fun","rank":282,"score":3.02},{"area":"mood","rank":309,"score":2.89},{"area":"graphics","rank":323,"score":3.04},{"area":"innovation","rank":380,"score":2.82}],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","linux","mac"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"How To Be A Super Successful Politician","category":"jam","description":"Make the tough decisions that politicians have to make.  How to raise money, exploit the people you represent, crush your opponent in the polls, all while ignoring your actual duties.\n\nHow To Play:\nThe goal of the game is simple.  By the time your campaign is over (12 months) gain more support at the polls than your opponent.  If you gain more support than your opponent, then you move on to the next higher level of government.\n\nTo do this, choose from three categories of what to do, and choose an action from those categories.  Each action will increase or decrease your and your opponent's support.\n\nEach action will also increase or decrease the overall \"health\" of your district.  But it doesn't matter; you can let it go to zero.  All that matters is that you get re-elected!  In-fact, if you actually do your job it's harder to get re-elected.\n\nWhich is the point of the game.  Most politicians don't actually do their jobs, they just work to get re-elected. ;)\n\nNote on the current build of the game:\nThis is a work in progress.  I did not get as much time as I wanted to work on the game.  I wanted different choices for each level, different map pictures per level, a profile of your politician in the upper right, and different win/lose screens and descriptions.  But I ran out of time.\n\nThis is also a solo entry.  But the submit was not working for me on Sunday night, so I had to enter this as a Jam entry on Monday morning.  Doesn't matter.

Hopefully it doesn't deter you from finishing... the ending is probably my favorite part.\n\n\nIf you've got your first ability, but are not sure how to get out of the first room... scrolls down for the solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the bars while in stealth mode.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/192d13a6e767c3e10c10c8abd1ef69e4.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=14357","author":{"name":"zatyka","uid":14357,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/71277e4c10b62928325ab7a206aacadf?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/zatyka/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14357-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14357-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14357-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14357-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14357-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14357-shot2.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14357-shot3.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14357-shot3.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14357-shot4.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14357-shot4.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (HTML5)","url":"http://zkatz.com/games/LD25"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4756521/LD25/The%20Best%20of%20me.capx"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":79},{"area":"mood","rank":105,"score":3.33},{"area":"theme","rank":114,"score":3.78},{"area":"overall","rank":167,"score":3.37},{"area":"audio","rank":202,"score":2.93},{"area":"fun","rank":213,"score":3.15},{"area":"innovation","rank":220,"score":3.17},{"area":"humor","rank":312,"score":2.69},{"area":"graphics","rank":475,"score":2.68}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"The townsfolk are coming!","category":"compo","description":"Yeah...

So I set out on this Dare with two goals: 1. remake one of my favorite games and 2. try to create something that can start a discussion. \n\nRegarding the first point: this entry is heavily inspired by Tilt to Live. If you enjoy the core gameplay of this entry, own an iPhone/iPad, and want to play something 1000x as fun, please check out: http://onemanleft.com/games/tilttolive/ It's by two really awesome dudes, and it's currently completely free. :D \n\nIn regards to the villainy theme: I'm from the US and during our \"war on terrorism\", I've often heard the \"we're actually the terrorists\" argument: US sends troops to hunt down terrorists, but also end up hurting just as many innocent civilians. I'm trying to ask: well, are we? But as it appears, I think I did a pretty bad job, lol. \n\nSome more general notes: Powered by Flixel, an awesome Flash library (flixel.org/). Trust me, haha, you'd wish I ran out of time if I didn't--but thankfully, I did run out of time before I could do what I attempt to call \"creating sfx/musics.\" All of the logic for this entry is pretty basic (as you can see from my source), can probably be found in various open-source Flixel games examples, and have been programmed (and reprogrammed) by me before in some time or another. Did I do anything new and challenging? I definitely didn't. Hundreds of fellow jammers took risks, learned new languages, and constructed algorithms from scratch in the last 48 hours. Those guys are amazing, and I feel like I need to admit that I'm not one of them this time. Just so you know if you're deciding between two ratings. \n\nAnd finally, thanks for taking the time to play! I hope you have fun.

You goal is to occupy every square of the city. \n\nThe screen is split in two - the GUI on the left and the City on the right. \n\nOn the left hand side is the GUI which is split into \"You\" and \"The Fuzz\" (police). The Fuzz is controlled by the computer AI. \n\nUnder each heading you have two stats to pay attention to; \"Gangsters\" and \"Fresh Blood\". Gangsters is the total number of gangsters you have available to distribute to the city squares. Fresh Blood is the number of new gangsters you will receive (every 15 seconds). \n\nThe Fuzz have the same stats but with different terminology. This gives you an insight into how they are doing. \n\nOn the right hand side is the City. The city is divided into 25 squares/zones. A zone can have 1 of 4 states. \n\n1) Neutral - indicated by the general peaceful appearance of the tile \n2) Occupied by the Fuzz - indicated by the police cars \n3) Occupied by you, the Mob - indicated by a black car, dead bodies, and no pedestrians \n4) Fighting - indicated by the presence of both you and the fuzz and a general state of chaos. \n\nIf you hover over any zone, a badge will be displayed with a number on it. This is the defence value of that zone. To occupy it, you must have enough Gangsters. Click the zone to occupy it. Your number of gangsters will be reduced by the value. \n\nAdditionally, the badge that is displayed when you hover over a zone will help you identify it (orange is neutral, blue is controlled by the fuzz, red is controlled by you, blue and red split down the middle is a fight) \n\nThe Zones all behave a little differently when you try to Occupy them. Lets look at that. \n\n1) Neutral - trying to occupy this will result in immediate occupation. \n2) Occupied by you - trying to occupy this will remove any gansters already in the sapce and return them to you \"Gangsters\" count for redistribution. \n3) Occupied by the fuzz - trying to occupy this will result in a fight. Your gangsters will decrement and the zone will change to a fight scene. After 5 seconds the fight will be resolved and you'll either be awarded the zone or the fuzz will. \n\nOccupy more zones to increase your \"Fresh Blood\". This in turn will award you more gangsters every 15 seconds. \n\n-------- Installation ----------\n\nPC Users: Extract the folder anywhere on your computer and double click the run.bat file\n\nMac Users: Extract the folder. Open a terminal and change to the extracted folder directory. Type ./run.sh\n\nEnjoy the game and I look forward to your feedback :)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/61fc6f7bc00d0def0895a8e64b49a86e.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=17895","author":{"name":"chrismwaite","uid":17895,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/35d9e7d91071135cd12cb58c56ca5ed7?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/chrismwaite/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17895-shot0.JPG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17895-shot0.JPG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17895-shot1.JPG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17895-shot1.JPG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/29v3hjsq1htoybf/Micro%20Mob.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/29v3hjsq1htoybf/Micro%20Mob.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/29v3hjsq1htoybf/Micro%20Mob.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":74},{"area":"graphics","rank":166,"score":3.5},{"area":"innovation","rank":172,"score":3.29},{"area":"audio","rank":182,"score":2.97},{"area":"theme","rank":226,"score":3.51},{"area":"mood","rank":236,"score":3.03},{"area":"fun","rank":240,"score":3.09},{"area":"overall","rank":254,"score":3.19},{"area":"humor","rank":477,"score":2.19}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"My First Ping Pong Massacre","category":"compo","description":"The name My First Ping Pong Massacre was randomly generated by the Video Game Name Generator, http://videogamena.me/.

It's a bit hard to see, but the build goes more transparent when it can't be built there, sorry. You can also only build on floor tiles.\nThere are three resources, you get all of them by killing enemies either through traps or fighting. \nSouls are for spawning monsters, bones are for building traps and buildings and blood is for research in the Blood Bath.\nCheck out the Help button to learn what the buildings do.\nUnits mainly only differ in health/speed/damage, but ninjas and buttermouses do not activate traps.\nIf you get stuck, try changing your tactics.\nUse spike traps in small corridors where you can predict where people go, place poison traps close to your heart to continously harm people attacking it. Piston traps are very effective if humans have to walk by a lava pool.\n\nHow to run:\nExtract the archive to an empty folder and then simply doubleclick the .jar file.\nOn a console:\njava -Djava.library.path=./ -jar DemonsInDungeons.jar\nMake sure to have at least JRE 1.6 installed!\nNote: I can't test the linux and mac archives, so please tell me if it doesn't work correctly and I will fix it. In any case, the Webstart version should always work.\n\nWarning: Does not include goats! Well, maybe a mutated goat or something.\n\nStory:\nWhile humanity was doing fun stuff that included laughing and singing and happyness, the evil forces of the abyss have been working to destroy the world. With their immense power they managed to open up portals to the overworld, allowing them to destroy everything and turn the planet into a living hell. Humans didn't really like that and probably got offended by it, that might be why they're now bravely entering those portals attacking YOUR realm. You're the right hand of the guy who leads all the destruction. Make sure to keep the dungeons safe. Place traps and kill everyone. Summon monsters and kill everyone. You can also do both, at the same time, which is rather convenient for your job. Just make sure that your dungeon does not get destroyed. Each dungeon has a pulsating \"Dungeon's Heart\" which keeps the dungeon alive. Take care of it and your master will be very proud of you. That's all.\n\nControls:\nThe controls are mostly based on the mouse and very simple.\nLeft click selects, right click performs an action. You can also left click and drag to select more than one unit.\nDouble clicking a specific type of unit will select all units of that type in a certain range.\nAlternatively, you can use the arrow keys to navigate in menues or move the camera around.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/858ff78420dcb4a9f9968f49f0ebeeb4.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=16114","author":{"name":"blay09","uid":16114,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b09a8520ef70a06c6a77637fffd5bbc5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/blay09/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16114-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16114-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16114-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16114-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16114-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16114-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16114-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16114-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16114-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16114-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://eiradir.org/blay09/ld25/DemonsInDungeons-win.zip"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbZIPQw_wxY"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://eiradir.org/blay09/ld25/DemonsInDungeons-linux.tar"},{"label":"Java Webstart","url":"http://eiradir.org/blay09/ld25/did.jnlp"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://eiradir.org/blay09/ld25/DemonsInDungeons-src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":61},{"area":"audio","rank":236,"score":2.82},{"area":"mood","rank":260,"score":2.97},{"area":"theme","rank":389,"score":3.16},{"area":"humor","rank":430,"score":2.31},{"area":"overall","rank":487,"score":2.77},{"area":"innovation","rank":495,"score":2.59},{"area":"fun","rank":511,"score":2.53},{"area":"graphics","rank":535,"score":2.5}],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Die Block","category":"compo","description":"Mechanics & Background:\nYou are the villan and have the ability to malform the world.

Press ESC to skip all the text.\n\nIn-game press ESC to return back to the main menu.\n\nUse arrows or WASD to move your unit. Move mouse to aim.\n\nMouse Wheel - cycle through weapons.\nKeyboard buttons 1, 2, 3 - switch to specific weapon.\nLeft Mouse Button - shoot with selected weapon.\nRight Mouse Button - shoot with all available weapons.\n\nSave game with F5 and load with F6 or from the main menu.\nSwitch screen mode with F4.\n\nGameplay:\n\nWatch your hit points, heat level and ammo.\n\n1. If your hit points get under 1, you explode.\n\n2. When you overheat (beyond 100%), you lose hit points. The more is the overheat, the more you get damage. If you move, you produce more heat and slow down the recovery.\n\nYour heat level is raised by your shots, and by receiving enemy shots.\n\n3. When you have no more ammo, it's almost as if you already lost.\n\nHP and ammo cannot be replenished. Coolness is regained automatically.\n\nYour mission is to destroy the enemies and evacuate to your start point - the center of the map.\n\n\nAuthors:\n\nProgramming: HD408\nSpriting: Yuuri\nMusic: Mr. RK\n\nTools used:\n\nEngine: Game Maker 8.0 Lite\nGraphics: GM built-in sprite editor, and I forgot to ask Yuuri\nMusic: FL Studio\nSound: sfxr\n\n17.12.2012","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e0d39fa868b2f7e66027635e6cd18ccf.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=12948","author":{"name":"HD408","uid":12948,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cc877a84f0a31b6b145f84879f2d017f?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/hd408/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/12948-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/12948-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/12948-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/12948-shot1.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/75034586/LD72-25/TSA.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1150,"score":10}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Villain Game","category":"compo","description":"I used Gimp to make the images.

I was going to do more with the theme too, there were going to be other super-villain animals as boss battles, but I think that was a bit ambitious.\nThanks for reading, hope you all enjoy it.\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/1415084e6bcd315a13ac3032564e7fcc.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=14838","author":{"name":"SecondDimension","uid":14838,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9e92a6ba81f057c57b70b0faf4af5d5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/seconddimension/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14838-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14838-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14838-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14838-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14838-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14838-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14838-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14838-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14838-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/14838-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5654499/Ludum%20Dare%202012/PsyGoat%20(LD25).zip"},{"label":"Soundtrack","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5654499/Ludum%20Dare%202012/Ludum%20Dare%2025%20Soundtrack.m4a"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5654499/Ludum%20Dare%202012/PsyGoat%20Source%20Files.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":72},{"area":"audio","rank":42,"score":3.57},{"area":"fun","rank":70,"score":3.55},{"area":"overall","rank":82,"score":3.58},{"area":"humor","rank":93,"score":3.43},{"area":"mood","rank":134,"score":3.26},{"area":"graphics","rank":159,"score":3.55},{"area":"innovation","rank":229,"score":3.16},{"area":"theme","rank":230,"score":3.5}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Sleight of Hand","category":"jam","description":"You are the villain:\n\nYou and your loyal kobold minion rob the poor people of Ludum.\n\nDistract the curious victim on the left with your charm and skills while your Minion performs some sneaky sleights of hand.\n\nUse the mouse to follow the path of the diamond in order to keep the victim distracted.

It still took me hours to edit and mix all the sounds but if you still think that it's not okay to use those sounds only give the Sound a bad rating, not the whole game.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c893288d65a3c9ca6919551ed88d6f92.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=17841","author":{"name":"TheCze","uid":17841,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7b94866421a706c1cb585c3875deb192?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/thecze/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17841-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/17841-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows/Linux","url":"http://www.zoneofcontrol.de/LD25/VillSim.jar"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://www.zoneofcontrol.de/LD25/VillSimAll.jar"},{"label":"Postcompo (All OS)","url":"http://www.zoneofcontrol.de/VillSimPostFat.jar"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.zoneofcontrol.de/LD25/VillSim10.rar"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":100},{"area":"humor","rank":13,"score":3.98},{"area":"theme","rank":16,"score":4.24},{"area":"mood","rank":73,"score":3.47},{"area":"fun","rank":89,"score":3.47},{"area":"overall","rank":128,"score":3.45},{"area":"innovation","rank":152,"score":3.36},{"area":"audio","rank":194,"score":2.94},{"area":"graphics","rank":258,"score":3.2}],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Ambush Predator 7: Angry Angler","category":"compo","description":"When the theme was first announced, my thoughts drifted to what we normally consider \"villainous\" creatures -- crocodiles, angler fish, sharks... after reading up a little on angler fish, I got the idea to make you \"shake\" your bioluminescent bacteria to hunt other fish.\n\n*Move with WASD (angler fish are slow)\n*Take a bite with the spacebar\n*Shake your mouse to shake your bioluminescent bacteria and attract fish.\n*Shake too much and they'll see your ugly face and run away (watch for the exclamation point).\n*Fish above you are attracted to your light.

Just think of LMB as being a jump button, and the cut marks are points where you can jump again in the air.\n\nHope that helps! \n\n***** \"IT DOESN'T FIT THE THEME\" *****\nFor anyone who thinks this game doesn't follow the theme, you have to reach the end to find out why it does (It's a very silly reveal, but it certainly fits! - we were going to have lots more on this stroy throughout the game, like endangered animals falling out of the trees, but we only got time to put something at the very end.) \n\nLumberjack is a game where you cut down trees by throwing your big axes and jumping from tree to tree, flailing madly. Be careful not to fall or you'll have to start again! \n\nThis is a hastily put together game under the worst of conditions. And somehow we managed to actually complete it! Well, no sound yet, and the prize at the end took about 3 minutes to conjure together. But you're missing the point, THERE'S A PRIZE AT THE END!\n\nAlso featuring impressive 3D Graphics, rendered in a 2D style. It the future of gaming, of the past!

Discovering these interaction rules is part of the game and can lead to a lower move score.\n3) There is a restart button.

This is me and WojWork's first Ludam Dare Jam, as well as our first ever completed game coincidentally.  I'm the programmer, and he was the game designer/artist.  There are still some errors in this game as it is, but we hope to polish it up and re-release it without any known issues.  In the meantime, enjoy!  And here's a message from WojWorks:\n\nWreck havoc as a villain making his way to become the evil ruler of a medieval kingdom!\n\nZ-jump\nX-attack\n\narrow keys-move/fly\n\nf4-fullscreen\n\nesc-exit game\n\nsound effect credit goes to these guys over at soundbible.com:\nBrandino480\nStephan Schutze\nMike Koenig\n\n\nWe've learned a-lot this time around, but here's what I know I couldn't get to fixing:\n\n-Knights occassionally move oddly on contact with the ground, nothing big.\n-Villagers with pitchforks aren't affected by fire on the ground.\n\nThis game was programmed with:\n-C++\n-Visual Studio 2010\n-Allegro 5.0.5 \n-A general game engine engine made to go with Allegro programmed by me beforehand.\n\nNote: I will not be porting this game to Linux/Mac ATM, it's' not worth the trouble I've realized it is.  I've learned my lesson, though, and Next Ludum Dare I will be working with Java!\n\nA Post Mortem has been made, albeit not with many changes.  Essentially it's just the following changes:\n\n-You can now properly close the window by clicking the \"X\" button.\n-You can now mute the game by pressing the M key.\n-The sounds have been re-balanced a bit in terms of volume.\n-The Knights no longer have any collision errors with the ground.\n-Villagers and the hero are now properly affected by fire on the ground.\n-Villagers now face left initially like they're supposed to.\n-A fire sound plays with the regular shooting sound when you have the ultimate weapon.\n\nSadly I didn't see much room for actually expanding this into a longer game, especially in the world outside of the Ludum Dare and its theme as an excuse for what the game is.  Would probably be good as a Flash/Java game, but... I don't really feel like porting into another language entirely just for that purpose.\n\nSo I'll leave it at this, if you aren't voting please be sure to play the post-mortem, it is error-free and pretty much what we'd intended the game to be in the first place.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/2beb0e99b4a6446bfdd85c82bf598920.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=18923","author":{"name":"DaGamesta","uid":18923,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/34eaa07fc033250588f8d69592c90681?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/dagamesta/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18923-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18923-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/41701455/ConquerTheKingdom.zip"},{"label":"Post Mortem (Windows)","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/41701455/ConquerTheKingdom%20%282%29.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/41701455/Code.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":91},{"area":"fun","rank":16,"score":3.8},{"area":"theme","rank":57,"score":3.82},{"area":"overall","rank":61,"score":3.51},{"area":"mood","rank":90,"score":3.21},{"area":"humor","rank":117,"score":2.87},{"area":"graphics","rank":128,"score":3.43},{"area":"innovation","rank":187,"score":2.73},{"area":"audio","rank":188,"score":2.62}],"platforms":["desktop","web","java"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Damsels","category":"compo","description":"You play the role of a villain who has to take damsels from the back of his van, cross busy highways, and place the damsels on the train tracks, to be hit by\noncoming trains.\n\nAuthor: RexSpaceman\nEmail: [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */\nTwitter: @RexSpaceman\n\nInstructions:\nW = Move Up\nS = Move Down\nA = Move Left\nD = Move Right\nSpacebar = Pick up/Drop Damsels\n\nAvoid being hit by the train or cars.

Original plan was for more stages and lots of other cool stuff. Some things are rushed, and there are quite some bugs.\n\nIf you're having trouble with the item combination; First pick up the items in the rooms using spacebar, then click the items in the inventory to select them, all 5 items must be clicked in a certain order. Hint: The glock comes first, and the bullet comes last.\n\nOnce you've built the final item, you can press space to use it at a certain location on the rooftop.\n\nIf you make it to the second stage, you will have trouble walking into horizontal path ways as well - we apologize, we were not able to fix this in time, but are planning to fix it for the post-jam version.\n\nMusic is currently bugged and only plays once as well. :(\n\nWe didn't get around to adding sound effects.\n\nFull version was planned to have 6 stages with different mechanics and puzzles to solve, and that is what we will do if we keep working on it past this jam as planned. Look forward to it!\n\n\nKnown Bugs/Issues:\n\n-Music doesn't loop correctly.\n-Squeezing through doorways and corridors can be quite difficult. Hitting corners sometimes causes you to glitch out as well.\n-Some objects can be walked underneath.\n-Rats don't animate properly and will stay still when they're near the player.\n-Didn't manage to put sound effects in. :(\n-Text doesn't display quite properly.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/0471b73f7062b438ecf7414df7da972b.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=16171","author":{"name":"JuiceBox Entertainment","uid":16171,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/dfa0272138e8abcad0a9e2235d384b58?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/drd64/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16171-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16171-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16171-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16171-shot1.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16171-shot2.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16171-shot2.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16171-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/16171-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.box.com/s/ha9n9czf03p3fkkb8mlo"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":69},{"area":"graphics","rank":109,"score":3.53},{"area":"audio","rank":197,"score":2.5},{"area":"theme","rank":225,"score":2.94},{"area":"humor","rank":250,"score":2},{"area":"mood","rank":250,"score":2.47},{"area":"overall","rank":255,"score":2.65},{"area":"fun","rank":261,"score":2.32},{"area":"innovation","rank":262,"score":2.39}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Shining Farce","category":"compo","description":"A VERY basic roguelike.\nDidn't have time for sound or music and it's light on content too but I think it'll have life beyond the compo to allow me to add in some of the more adventurous/exciting ideas that didn't make it.\nThe most glaring (technical) issue I know of is the lack of line of sight blocking ranged attacks.\nI'd also planned to have a much more interesting level/dungeon but alas time was against me.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/5e4cfcc54b4cfeed0d6fa48b247cfcc8.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=8352","author":{"name":"De10ter","uid":8352,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b7c8416480e3500d1ddbeef26d72a807?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/de10ter/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/8352-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/8352-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/8352-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/8352-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/8352-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/8352-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6663023/dex/LD25/shiningfarce.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6663023/dex/LD25/ShiningFarce.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"overall","rank":505,"score":2.74},{"area":"graphics","rank":571,"score":2.37},{"area":"theme","rank":614,"score":2.56},{"area":"mood","rank":661,"score":2.14},{"area":"fun","rank":681,"score":2.05},{"area":"innovation","rank":734,"score":1.84},{"area":"coolness","rank":898,"score":36}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"TEK45","category":"compo","description":"UNFINSHED!

For some reason, it made sense when thinking about it :D\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/fd6cfe4d641b025216382890e780df99.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=12053","author":{"name":"Luis Anton","uid":12053,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9ff95932057efec0d8724a280cfa464b?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/notnasiul/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/12053-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/12053-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/12053-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/12053-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2292915/online/LD25_YouAreTheVillain/WeMeetAgainWindows.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2292915/online/LD25_YouAreTheVillain/WeMeetAgainMac.app.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2292915/online/LD25_YouAreTheVillain/WeMeetAgain.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":65},{"area":"theme","rank":10,"score":4.33},{"area":"humor","rank":41,"score":3.7},{"area":"innovation","rank":69,"score":3.7},{"area":"overall","rank":137,"score":3.43},{"area":"fun","rank":213,"score":3.15},{"area":"graphics","rank":239,"score":3.26},{"area":"mood","rank":260,"score":2.97},{"area":"audio","rank":629,"score":1}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web","mac"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"YaNaTMHSwaBID","category":"jam","description":"","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/7c0ff89fbf40ea540aa3c7e8964e6cf7.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=19607","author":{"name":"E.Hyde","uid":19607,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e49673a332d80bf38bd544ed6225e0d5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/e-hyde/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19607-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/19607-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (Unity)","url":"http://www.magiccarpenters.com/ld25/0wned_by_HYDE"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1189,"score":0}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Purple Fingers","category":"compo","description":"Special thanks to Fabio Picchi (<3), Lucas Senna (happy birthday!) and Pedro Camara (my cellmate, also, see his entry: http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=11981).","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/02b5d1bb302e9e1403260f882ca99e56.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=18165","author":{"name":"heloheu","uid":18165,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/410ae25734075742a587d7dfe242a404?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/heloheu/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18165-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18165-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18165-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18165-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18165-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18165-shot2.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18165-shot3.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/18165-shot3.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://catavento.art.br/purpleFingers/"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/39621822/purpleFingers_source.rar"},{"label":"Time lapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF8JY3Cfrfo"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":54},{"area":"theme","rank":55,"score":3.97},{"area":"graphics","rank":80,"score":3.87},{"area":"innovation","rank":88,"score":3.63},{"area":"humor","rank":128,"score":3.26},{"area":"overall","rank":133,"score":3.44},{"area":"mood","rank":183,"score":3.15},{"area":"fun","rank":210,"score":3.16},{"area":"audio","rank":338,"score":2.5}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Renegade Theologian","category":"jam","description":"\"Renegade Theologian\"\n Collect (steal!) the 8 books.

They've even brought in their pet dogs for assistance.\n\nUse daggers sparingly - Kane can't carry many, and throwing them at guards tends to make them cross.\n\nYou can loot houses when near the door, or pick the pockets of guards who haven't spotted you yet.\n----------------------------------------------------------\n* Fixed versions *\n\nSome people have had problems running the game because of it not finding the AVBin library, though it's packaged alongside the executable.  I've built a \"fixed\" version, which hopefully might improve things, though I can't be sure as I couldn't reproduce the original problem on any of the three machines I tried.  This version should at least allow you to run it without sound if the problem comes up.  I also tweaked a couple of numbers to fix some tiny mistakes, but it's virtually identical to the submitted version.\n----------------------------------------------------------\nI'm pretty happy with the way this turned out.  There were very few roadblocks, so every spare hour went into more features - and there was plenty more I could do there.  I did manage to get a goat in, after a fashion, for those of you who get that far.  Some things could've used a bit more tuning - e.g. one guard gets stuck on his path, and maybe the alert distance should've been a little higher - but overall I think it's a pretty good result.  I'm not utterly destroyed after the 48 hours, thanks to a few breaks here and there, which helps too :)\n\nThanks as always to Greasemonkey for Autotracker and Increpare for Bfxr.  A bit of simple sound can go a long way.\n\nTo run the 'source' version, you'll need to have Python and Pyglet installed.  If you're on Windows or Linux, hopefully the builds will work for you without hassle.\n\nAlso, by the way, I forgot to write on the control list that 'P' pauses the game.\n\nHope you enjoy having a mess around with it :)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/8459ae932f7f9a0182e07d563d73806d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=11560","author":{"name":"schnerble","uid":11560,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/13a634273f83f09685a951975178b1f5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/schnerble/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11560-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11560-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11560-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/201083/11560-shot1.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/478847/thievery/thievery-windows.zip"},{"label":"Windows (fixed)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/478847/thievery/thievery-windows2.zip"},{"label":"Linux 64-bit","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/478847/thievery/thievery-linux.tgz"},{"label":"Linux (fixed)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/478847/thievery/thievery-linux2.tgz"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/478847/thievery/thievery-source2.tgz"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":79},{"area":"fun","rank":54,"score":3.63},{"area":"overall","rank":194,"score":3.3},{"area":"audio","rank":210,"score":2.91},{"area":"theme","rank":230,"score":3.5},{"area":"humor","rank":277,"score":2.79},{"area":"mood","rank":349,"score":2.8},{"area":"graphics","rank":475,"score":2.68},{"area":"innovation","rank":476,"score":2.63}],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":25,"title":"Train Villain","category":"compo","description":"It's Pipe Dream but with train tracks and goats.
