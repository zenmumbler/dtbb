So you rjob is it to defeat other overlords, manage your kingdom and have as few survivers as possible after each fight in order to keep the \ntreasury full.\n\n![Battle_Bigger.png](///raw/d09/z/cbb0.png)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow To Play:\n\nThe game is played via the mouse. There are two different modes normal and endless as well as 4 different Difficultys ( endless as well as the hardest difficulty is locked. You can either play the game to unlock them or press the \"C\";\"R\";\"A\";\"S\";\"H\" Keys on your Keyboard at the same time while you are in the Menu.This will unlock those options after starting the normal mode and hoing back to the menu).\n\nThere are two Phases during the game:\n\nPhase 1: The Building Phase\n\nYou basically manage your people in order to produce more people and gold.\nYou can also change the ratios of people in the different devisions. \n\nPhase 2: The Fight\n\nYou try to defeat the enemys on the right side of the screen.\nYou can choose a target by clicking on your troops and afterwards at the enemy you want to attack.\n\nBow > Spear;\nSpear > Horse;\nHorse > Bow;\n\nAfter the fight you have to pay every surviver 5 Gold. If you can not do that you lose.\n\nThe game is played in Turns. The duration of at turn depends on the difficulty. To jump to the next turn you can press the Skipping Arrows in the top right corner.\n\nA word of \"warning\": since i run out of time i had no time to really balance the game. There is a high chance that either your team or the enemy team gets way to strong way to fast. There might also be a few things that look like they have a function but actually dont have one.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Tought process\n\nThe Idea was a game where you have to play strategically bad in Order to maximise your Profit. ( The more surviver, the worse it is) . Sadly the game is far from what i wanted it to be. Not only was I ill for ~50% of the jam, i also made everything way to complex. When you look in the code you can find a lot of things that arent used rigth now because they where planed for systems that didnt make it because I run out of time. Well regardless i liked the idea that i came up with and i at least think the \"game\" is good for what i archieved to produce. I also wanted to know how hard it would be to translate the game ( build the system and so one) turns out it was easier than i expected .","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d09/z/cb1e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/overloan","author":{"name":"MC_Crash","uid":2317,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/mc-crash"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d09/z/cbb0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d09/z/cbb0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zEoAeCSIXVrzypUAbIICxSuDCfK1TMci"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Escape the Deep","category":"compo","description":"In this game you play a little guy whose planet got hit by an asteroid and caused a huge flood over the planet.\nAs the level of water rises he needs to go up and up to stay on dry land.\nAs he goes up he also needs to save the small children.\nBe aware of the other creatures as they will end the players life.\n\nCollect a stone and use it to throw those opponents.

This year I took a chance at it! \n\nThis was the first jam I participated in, and also my first game developed from scratch (not using a tutorial). Also, please ignore the horrible code... I program as a hobby (mostly)!\n\nI came up with the idea of the game about 2h into the challenge. And this is what I was able to code so far.\n\n![karma.gif](///raw/7de/e/z/bed9.gif)\n\n## The concept\n\nThe concept is quite simple:\n\n1. You play as a.. well.. not so nice guy.. and you want to move forward in life\n2. Sometimes people will get in your way, so you deal with them\n3. You may use some 'special actions' to help you along...\n4. ...but beware of the **negative karma** they may bring in the future\n\nGo as far as you can. Use specials wisely. Things can get really bad, really fast!\n\n## Features\n* 3 types of NPCs\n* 3 different special actions to use\n* One inevitable wall of time/karma coming for you...\n\nThe more you collect special actions, the easier (and faster) you will get to your goal. **But, the more you use them the higher your Karma and the tougher things will get for you in the future...** Use special actions wisely!\n\n## Things to know\n* Like in life, Karma is not instantaneous, but your actions do have consequences\n* You can use a special action more than once but it will make your Karma stay negative longer\n\n![features.PNG](///raw/7de/e/z/d525.png)\n\n## Installing the game\n**Unfortunately I wasn't able to figure out how to build an executable file from my Python code (I guess this is why nobody is using Python), so the source code will have to do. Instruction on how to install are available below.**\n\n1. Make sure you have **Python 3** on your machine\n2. Clone the repository at https://github.com/gcmartinelli/karma - `git clone https://github.com/gcmartinelli/karma.git`\n3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n4. Run the game `python main.py`\n5.

Just don't kill yourself while doing it.\n\n## HTML5 Version on Gamejolt (with broken audio :'( ):\n\nhttps://gamejolt.com/games/internet-points/301376\n\n\n# HOW TO PLAY\n\nGameplay revolves around \"designing\" stunts using a madlibs-style interface. When you do a stunt, you get followers, and then you can sell your followers' data to various interested parties. This allows you to convert followers to money. Money can then be used to unlock new stunts.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\n* Design and perform unique stunts\n* Gain followers\n* Sell data from your followers\n* Use money to unlock new stunt types\n* Rinse and repeat until you die\n\n\n# STUNT OUTCOMES\n\nEach stunt consists of three main values:\n\n* Risk percentage: The chances of an accident/injury occurring\n* Danger: The health lost if you have an accident/injury\n* Stupidity level: A special value with some situational bonuses. The main benefit is that getting away with stupid things increases your \"dumb luck\" stat. This stat reduces your risk. \n\n## Healing\n\nAccidents are unavoidable, so when they do happen be sure to heal yourself. Press the [SPACE BAR] at any time to switch views and find your medications and car keys (so you can go to the hospital).\n\nEvery time you use medicine, you increase your tolerance to it. If that happens, make sure you go to the hospital, because the drugs there are much stronger. HOWEVER, you can still build up a tolerance to the hospital's drugs (but more slowly). There's no other way to heal, so try to avoid having to use them!\n\n\n## REWARDS FOR DOING STUPID THINGS\n\nThis includes avoiding an accident in a stunt with 50%, or having an accident in a stunt with less than 50% risk. Doing any of those things increase your dumb luck. The \"dumb luck\" stat decreases your overall risk, so if you have a lot of it, you can probably get away with doing something incredibly risky.\n\n# Gameplay formulas\n\nIf you REALLY want to know how the reward system works, look at the class PlayData in the file PlayData.hx in the source code. I tried to write something that would make the game at least playable, but I think it could have benefited with more time for play testing. The statistics tied to the various stunts are just numbers I came up with on the spot, and tweaked a bit with very limited testing. I don't even know if it's possible to unlock them all. :\\","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8fb/z/abb5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/glorious-internet-points","author":{"name":"Ale","uid":3064,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//8fb/z/bc61.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/ale"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8fb/z/ae02.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//8fb/z/ae02.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/AlexRamallo/LD40/releases/tag/compo"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"SpaceCab","category":"compo","description":"LD40 !\nDone with my strange motor based on SFML and/or Qt : https://github.com/Bobombe/MotorQtOrSFML\nDownload SpaceCab.zip, unzip then play with arrows and space.\n\nSome explications :\n\nThe goal is to make some money !\nTo do so, you must bring some pods to their planet (same color).\n\nYou lose if your power goes below 0.\nYou lose power while driving and when you hit an other space car.\nYou can make them leave the Hyperway by firing at them (Space bar).\n\nThe more pods you bring the slower you get, and the more power you lose.\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//743/d/z/acc2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/spacecab","author":{"name":"bobombe","uid":54087,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/bobombe"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/Bobombe/MotorQtOrSFML/blob/master/SpaceCab.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"NTOZ 2","category":"jam","description":"NTOZ 2 (Never Tired of Zombies 2) is a game of survival, where you fight against the endless hoards of the dead.\n\nControls are outlined in the game.\n\nThanks for playing!","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c85/z/d00c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/ntoz-2","author":{"name":"Mack101dog","uid":1420,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c85/z/93b4.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/mack101dog"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_OIe0b_5piZmbpOHaDiMYUNjsEA2_O7Q/view?usp=sharing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Soul Warrior Merope - Soaring Soul","category":"jam","description":"Soul Warrior Merope - Soaring Soul is a resource management game in the guise of an infinite scrolling shoot 'em up.

In the process you get attacked by flying space rabbits who figured out that stealing your crystals is easier than mining their own. The more crystals you have, the more rabbits come take them.\nThe game would need some more work, but that's how far we could get it in 3 days.\n\nCode by @grizeldi, art by @negdo, level design by @PickyDogFish. Only one person in the team had prior gamedev experience.\n\n# Instructions\nWASD - move\n\n1, 2, 3 - select turret type to place\n\nCollect enough crystals to fuel up your ship and then press F to win. If your crystals go into negative, you lose. Each rabbit that comes to your ship steals 5 crystals.\n\n**In placement mode:**\n\nleft click - place turret\n\nright click - cancel placement\n\n# Turret descriptions:\n**Slot 1 - Miner - 5 crystals**\n\nMines for crystals. Produces 1 crystal per 10 seconds when placed on a crystal or 1 crystal per 45 seconds if not placed on a crystal.\n\n**Slot 2 - Sentry - 15 crystals**\n\nShoots any rabbits that come into range and then has 20 seconds long cooldown period.\n\n**Slot 3 - Bear Trap - 4 crystals**\n\nLies on the ground until it detects a rabbit. Then it flies up into the sky and strikes from the above.\n\n# Installation\nJust download the game for your platform, extract the downloaded zip and run the executable.\n\n\n# Screenshots\n![Screen Shot 12-04-17 at 07.59 PM.PNG](///raw/0cd/d/z/ba82.png)\n\n![Screen Shot 12-04-17 at 08.00 PM.PNG](///raw/0cd/d/z/ba83.png)\n\n![Screen Shot 12-04-17 at 08.01 PM.PNG](///raw/0cd/d/z/ba8a.png)\n\n![Screenshot_7.png](///raw/941/e/z/baa6.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//941/e/z/b904.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/empowed-state","author":{"name":"grizeldi","uid":57649,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/grizeldi"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//941/e/z/baab.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//941/e/z/baab.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0cd/d/z/ba82.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0cd/d/z/ba82.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0cd/d/z/ba83.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0cd/d/z/ba83.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0cd/d/z/ba8a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0cd/d/z/ba8a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//941/e/z/baa6.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//941/e/z/baa6.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://negdo.itch.io/empowered-state"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://negdo.itch.io/empowered-state"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Order Now!","category":"jam","description":"You think you can't have too many friends?

I figured the more tenants you get, the more complaints you get, and the angrier they get. Eventually, tenants might get pissed and trash the place if you aren't listening to them, and that might drive you to bankruptcy.\n\nThis game entirely uses the mouse. If I'd had more time, I would have added more options for interacting with the building. Right now it's nice to look around and see how your tenants have repainted their apartments, but being able to destroy part of the building or build the apartment however you see fit might be interesting. If I were going to add anything like that, I would make the complaints less frequent and more varied.

If they are opposite colors, then they will shrink slightly.  \n\nConsuming a circle, regardless of color, will add progress to the level bar at the bottom of the screen. The higher the level you reach, the more enemy circles that will spawn\n\n## Download and Install\nThe download link is below, but I'll include it here as well\n\nhttps://github.com/manbeardgames/Droplet/releases/download/v1.0/Droplet.zip\n\nIt's hosted on my github page.

I'm so proud to have finished this and be able to be apart of Ludum Dare.  I choose to use MonoGame to develop this, which I have only just recently in the past week started learning and working with.  \n\nThis is not only my first Ludum but my first game jam.  I had no idea, even with a simple idea, if I'd be able to finish in the time allowed.  I was incredibly nervous about this since I was also learning a new framework.\n\nI streamed development and it was really great having people come in, giving suggestions, even some sending me early builds of their projects to try and and give feedback.  I hope to do this again for each time Ludum Dare comes around.  \n\nThanks for checking out the game\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9cc/d/z/b3cc.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/droplet","author":{"name":"ManBeardGames","uid":56521,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9cc/d/z/9e03.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/manbeardgames"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/manbeardgames/Droplet/releases/download/v1.0/Droplet.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Coastal Postal","category":"jam","description":"![ld40_title.png](///raw/d66/2/z/d8bd.png)\n\n\nThink island life is easygoing?

Remember, workers cost money to maintain.\n\nSome more Images:\n![First Screenshot.JPG](///raw/c33/z/c56b.jpg)\n\n![2.JPG](///raw/c33/z/c566.jpg)\n\n![3.JPG](///raw/c33/z/c56c.jpg)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c33/z/c55d.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/lava-lamp-factory","author":{"name":"Jcourt","uid":828,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/jcourt"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c33/z/c56b.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c33/z/c56b.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c33/z/c566.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c33/z/c566.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c33/z/c56c.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c33/z/c56c.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://jcourt325.itch.io/lava-lamp-factory"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Kittea Party","category":"jam","description":"![only-title2.png](///raw/d71/4/z/be63.png)\n\n## About the game\nLovely old lady Gertrude wants to help poor stray kittens by taking them into her house…\nAnd she also loves to organize tea parties for all her friends!\nBUT - too many kittens (while awesome) means that the house can rapidly become a mess! \nAnd Gertrude’s friends don’t want to stumble upon smelly cat poop while they’re drinking darjeeling tea and eating butter cookies. But fear not – if Gertrude acts quickly, she’ll be able to clean the annoying poop in no time!\n\n![kittea_party2.gif](///raw/d71/4/z/be45.gif)\n\nThe goal of Kittea Party is to find a happy balance where Gertrude has all the kittens she needs to throw a party (each new party requires more kittens than the previous), but still be able to maintain a relatively clean house. Successful (and poop-free) parties give Gertrude more prestige, which in turn means more friends!\n\n## How to Play\n* Choose between WASD movement or WASD relative to mouse.\n* Press E to clean poop\n* Random adoption popup will appear from time to time asking if you want to adopt a cat\n* You need a certain number of cats to host a tea party\n* If a guest steps on poop, they slips and leave the house and tells everyone what happened, leaving you with less prestige.\n* **You lose** if you reach negative prestige!\n* When the party comes to an end you earn 1 prestige for each guest that made it\n\n## Notes\n* There is no PAUSE menu. To leave the game while playing either lose or Alt+F4\n\n## Screenshots\n![screen1.jpg](///raw/d71/4/z/be81.jpg)\n\n![screen4.jpg](///raw/d71/4/z/be84.jpg)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d71/4/z/bea1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/kittea-party","author":{"name":"JPiolho","uid":16765,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d71/4/z/9363.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/jpiolho"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d71/4/z/be63.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d71/4/z/be63.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d71/4/z/be45.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d71/4/z/be45.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d71/4/z/be81.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d71/4/z/be81.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d71/4/z/be84.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d71/4/z/be84.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://jpiolho.itch.io/kittea-party"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://jpiolho.itch.io/kittea-party"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://jpiolho.itch.io/kittea-party"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"RedCell","category":"compo","description":"Join our intrepid heroine, a red blood cell, as she removes carbon dioxide from the lungs of your body!

Also, the more factories you click, the more that will appear, so be ready to sharpen your reflexes and don't let any factory explode!\n\nIt's coded in C++ in a custom engine I'm developing, it's in early development so I won't be giving the source code for the engine yet, since it still needs some tweaking, but when it's ready, I'll upload it to [github](https://github.com/StrellyN) along side all the games I've developed for it.\n\nThe graphics were made by my [brother](https://twitter.com/pemayorca) and I got royalty free music, that's why I disabled Audio voting, the link to the authors videos are in a txt in the game download.\n\nI encourage you to [twit me](https://twitter.com/unasimplevida) an image with your best time and points, let's see who gets the most points!\n\nLinux version was tested in Mint Linux and Arch Linux, I've seen people running the game without installing SDL2, but you may need SDL2, SDL2Image, SDL2Mixer and SDL2Ttf to make it work: sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev, sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev, same with mixer and ttf.\n\nControls: The only button is the left mouse button.\n\n![screenMenu.png](///raw/b87/2/z/9bfb.png)\n\n![screenHowTo.png](///raw/b87/2/z/9bfc.png)\n\n![screenGamePlay.png](///raw/b87/2/z/9bfd.png)\n\n![screenGameOver.png](///raw/b87/2/z/9bfe.png)\n\nTime lapse of the development:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIKm-vhRUxs\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b87/2/z/9bfa.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/warning-steam-workshop","author":{"name":"Strelly","uid":10123,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b87/2/z/4d6b.gif","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/strelly"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b87/2/z/9bfb.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b87/2/z/9bfb.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b87/2/z/9bfc.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b87/2/z/9bfc.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b87/2/z/9bfd.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b87/2/z/9bfd.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b87/2/z/9bfe.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b87/2/z/9bfe.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/vluosmwnv0acg1s/Warning%21%20Steam%20Workshop%21.rar?dl=0"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/2i9cm3y1j89tgba/Warning%20Steam%20Workshop%20Linux.zip?dl=0"},{"label":"web","url":"https://strelly.itch.io/warning-steam-workshop"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Warehouse Worker","category":"jam","description":"# Warehouse Worker\n\n![titleScreen.png](///raw/fa7/e/z/c2f6.png)\n\n## How To Play\n\nBe as quick as you can, and package every item that is ordered, as quick as possible.\nAs orders stack, you will have trouble finding the item you require to package and move the orders along, so be quick!\n\nThe more orders there are, the harder it gets!\n\n## Controls\n\nWASD - Move\n\nE - Interact\n\n## Comments\n\nThis is my first time participating in a JAM.

Nanomachines generate heat, however, and while some heat is good, it can result in problems if it gets too high. Too many bacteria can overwhelm nanomachines, as well, and destroy them. Fill up the power meter to win! Lose your last nanomachine, or overheat, and it's game over.\n\nControls:\n - WASD to move the camera around.\n - Mouse wheel to zoom in/out.\n - Click, drag, and drop to use your tools.\n - Alphanumeric 1, 2, and 3 keys to change tools (or just click the onscreen buttons).\n - Esc to quit.\n\nTools:\n - Dropper - Add more bacteria to the petri dish.\n - Magnet - Pick up and drop nanomachines. Move them out of the petri dish to stop them from generating heat!\n - Forceps - Pick up and drop food (bacteria tend to stick around these).\n\nAdditional info:\n - Bacteria logic operates off of standard Conway's Life rules, and exist in three layers.\n - As heat rises and falls, bacteria will slow down (either when it's too hot, or too cold). \n - If it gets too hot, bacteria will start dying off! If it tops out, it's game over.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe4ZT7dg8lM\n\n------------------------\n\nTips:\n\nNanomachines have a hidden health stat, by which their size is determined. Once it reaches a certain threshold, they divide into two smaller machines (with health divided between them).\n\nHealth goes up when a nanomachine manages to eat bacteria, but this is a contested action: If the number of bacteria around them is low, they'll generally succeed in eating some. If they're surrounded by too many bacteria, though, they'll take damage instead (get smaller).\n\nKeep in mind, bacteria exist in 3 layers, so there may actually be more bacteria in a given space than there appears -- a good way to gauge this is how opaque they are.\n\nSo in general, a good strategy is to move nanomachines to where there are only a few bacteria, and keep them away from dense populations.\n\nPro tip: As soon as your nanomachines divide the first time, it's probably a good idea to grab one and move it out of the petri dish. That way you always have one in reserve, and don't have to worry about running out of nanomachines.\n\n------------------------\n\nChangelog:\n - Added instruction slides to splash screens (not sure if this violates the spirit of the rules... if so, let me know, and I'll yank 'em)\n - Fixed issue where tile rules weren't working, and only default tile was used.\n - WebGL version still not available, as tiles don't render at all on that platform. If fixable, will upload a WebGL build as soon as possible.\n - Game Over condition was missing for having too much heat. Fixed.\n - Fixed artifacts around Forceps tool.\n - Added Escape key to quit the game.\n - Added Mac and Linux builds (untested).","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ea0/4/z/af44.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/nano-life","author":{"name":"primitive-concept","uid":16558,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ea0/4/z/2c0c.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/primitive-concept"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.primitiveconcept.com/games/nanolife/NanoLife-PC.zip"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://www.primitiveconcept.com/games/nanolife/NanoLife-Mac.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://www.primitiveconcept.com/games/nanolife/NanoLife-Linux.zip"},{"label":"web","url":"https://www.primitiveconcept.com"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Hug Me I'm Cold","category":"jam","description":"## It's really cold.

The more feng-shui you lose, the more hostile the ghosts are towards each other.\n\n![caution.png](///raw/b39/1/z/ad2b.png) ![arena.png](///raw/b39/1/z/ad2d.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b39/1/z/ae31.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/zhenco-ghost-management","author":{"name":"amras0000","uid":6459,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b39/1/z/3a0e.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/amras0000"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b39/1/z/ad80.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b39/1/z/ad80.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b39/1/z/ad2b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b39/1/z/ad2b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b39/1/z/ad2d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b39/1/z/ad2d.png"}],"links":[{"label":"PDF","url":"http://amras.dowolnanazwa.pl/ludumdare/40/ZhenCo-FSHDII-Specification.pdf"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://amras.dowolnanazwa.pl/ludumdare/40/ZhenCo_nix.zip"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://amras.dowolnanazwa.pl/ludumdare/40/ZhenCo_win64.zip"},{"label":"macOS","url":"COMING SOON"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["linux","desktop","win","mac"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Crosstalk","category":"compo","description":"![SsyO+a.png](///raw/864/d/z/c68a.png)\n\nAn abstract white noise toy.

It's written in MicroPython and uses a tile-and-sprites library that I wrote.\n\n![IMG_20171203_171355.jpg](///raw/3b1/f/z/a032.jpg)\n\nI really wanted to make a space shooter, so I just rolled with the Space Invaders clone. But how to accommodate the theme? Well, in Space Invaders the more aliens you have in a row, the worse it is, since they advance faster. But that somehow didn't feel good enough, so I tried something more. In the original Space Invaders you could only have one missile on the screen at a time — if you missed, you had to wait for it to travel to the edge of the screen before you could shoot again. That encouraged more careful aiming. But what if you could shoot a second time, but the more you have missiles on the screen, the worse it is in terms of fire power? So the second missile you shoot is much smaller, and the third is simply embarrassingly tiny. Turns out that this doesn't affect the game much, though.\n\nAs you can hear, there are hardware problems with sound on my console right now. The sound circuit is just under the player's fingers, and touching it gives you nasty warbling and clicks. Plus there are a lot of clicks from the way the wav files are being played. I will need to fix that in the future versions somehow — move the circuit to a different place of the board, maybe add some shielding, we will see.\n\nFinally, I know it sucks that you can't play the game yourself to rate it. I wanted to provide an emulator, so that you can at least play it on your computer, but it turned out to be harder to make than anticipated and it's not ready yet. If you *really* want, you can build a similar console yourself from stock modules (there are instructions on the project's page), but of course I can't expect everyone to do this. So there is the video: (https://youtu.be/fCqvTueoG7I).

Once you have a chain long enough, touch the Save icon to input it. Then, create a new DNA strand! The more strands, the more \"interesting\" your creatures becomes. Some may say that you can create the WORST creature of them all....\n\n\nPlay the game here!! https://kilthxd.itch.io/genenom :smile: :smile:\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b82/z/bf88.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/genenom","author":{"name":"stencilchris","uid":651,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/stencilchris"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b82/z/bf8a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b82/z/bf8a.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://kilthxd.itch.io/genenom"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Ripper","category":"jam","description":"My first LudumDare ever and honestly did not quite go as expected.

They will come one by one, and you can decide whether to make friends with them or not.  Once you become someone's friend, you automatically tell your secret to them.  So be careful because everyone has a different possibility of exposing your secret.  When your secret gets exposed to other people, they become haters (purple).  You can't make friend with haters ;)\n\nHowever, when you discover your friend is telling your secret, you can just go to him and break off with him.  He will immediately stop exposing and leave the party.\n\nPurple guys have a slightly lower rate of exposing secret but they still do, and you can't control them.  But luckily they'll leave the party earlier than normal.\n\nGreen guys turn dark, or even orange and red when they expose too much of your secret.  My suggestion is that break off with them first.\n\nYour goal is to make as many friends as possible, but for each secret got exposed you lose some marks.  Of course, breaking off with friends leads to a score deduction, too, but I still recommend to stop the blabbermouths as early as possible to avoid more marks off.\n\nBy the way, you can't make friends with people who are in a convo ;)\n\nThe game will finish when you don't have any light-gray guests in the room.\n\nSo it's sort of a strategy game... You need to balance between making friends and stuff... Hope I explained it clearer now, and wish you like it ;)\n\n\n![ss1.png](///raw/cc9/f/z/b36b.png)\n![ss2.png](///raw/cc9/f/z/b36c.png)\n![ss3.png](///raw/cc9/f/z/b36d.png)\n![ss4.png](///raw/cc9/f/z/b36f.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cc9/f/z/9f2f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/secret","author":{"name":"WiseClock","uid":63948,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/wiseclock"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cc9/f/z/b36b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cc9/f/z/b36b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cc9/f/z/b36c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cc9/f/z/b36c.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cc9/f/z/b36d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cc9/f/z/b36d.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cc9/f/z/b36f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cc9/f/z/b36f.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HjxX5j1vofz_piK_Zt5cX_W81Vo19GDw"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://wiseclock.itch.io/secret"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wOCC8r98opVvyh2Af52dceK2BCS6UHNV"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://0w0.ca/secret/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web","mac"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"J-C's poopy evolution","category":"jam","description":"J-C's poopy evolution is the story of John-Chlodd, a man who has to feed the \"Time Monster\".

Walking into the cave opens a playable level. 3 enemies will spawn here. Left click shoots a green bullet that bounces. It will deal more knockback and more damage the faster it is going. Right click shoots a blue bullet, this bullet does no damage but deals heaps of knockback. You can knock yourself around with bullets or even knock bullets with bullets to add to their speed or change their direction. Space bar switches the direction of all bullets. Walking through the right door moves you to a new room and adds to your loot. Walking through the left door moves you back to the previous room. The health of the enemies is\ndetermined by the amount of loot you have, I.E the more loot you get, the harder it is. Enemies will try to touch you, if they do you will lose a life. If you lose 10 lives, you lose all the loot you got from that level and 10% of your other unused loot.\n\nYou will need Java to play the game.\n\n![gameplay.jpg](///raw/266/9/z/d2e4.jpg)![entry.jpg](///raw/266/9/z/d2e6.jpg)![ship.jpg](///raw/266/9/z/d2e7.jpg)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//266/9/z/ca49.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/fuga","author":{"name":"SurprisinglyShockedCat","uid":38498,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/surprisinglyshockedcat"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//266/9/z/d2e4.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//266/9/z/d2e4.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//266/9/z/d2e6.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//266/9/z/d2e6.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//266/9/z/d2e7.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//266/9/z/d2e7.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15gRJH8zDi0ewrHI0pqB2pKwkh9QCBMJe?usp=sharing"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15gRJH8zDi0ewrHI0pqB2pKwkh9QCBMJe?usp=sharing"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15gRJH8zDi0ewrHI0pqB2pKwkh9QCBMJe?usp=sharing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Annoying Dogs","category":"jam","description":"# Dogs League and Dog-engers are in the city !\n## Your mission \n\nSave the World from the super Dogs!  :earth_africa: :dog: :earth_americas: :dog: :earth_asia: \n\n\nCity is generated proceduraly and dogs too !

I realized how easy it is to get caught up in scope and want to add all the features you think of in the beginning. I also learned to set aside as much time as possible, because I didn't get to work on the art and music as much as I wanted to... I wanted to make it look like some kind of pixelated Communist operating system, but I definitely didn't give myself enough time for that. Next time I will keep my idea more simple and allow myself some time for making it look good too!\n\nAlso, make sure you've used the game engine ahead of time or you will waste a ton of time on easily avoided bugs...\n****\n\nLet me know what you think! Good and bad :)\n\nI was inspired by some movies I watched recently about life during The Great Leap Forward in early Communist China and the difficulties of distributing food and meeting quotas during that time, hence keeping with the theme, \"The More you have, the Worse it is.\"\n\nI used LÖVE 2D game engine, Pyxel Edit for graphics, and Beepbox.co for music/sound. I used the lume and nuklear lua libraries for LÖVE to help with the UI.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//fe7/c/z/cfdf.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/some-kind-of-2d-platformer","author":{"name":"Alex Dunford","uid":51183,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/alex-dunford"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//fe7/c/z/cff6.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//fe7/c/z/cff6.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//fe7/c/z/cffb.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//fe7/c/z/cffb.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/adunford3/ld40/blob/master/Distributor.zip"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/adunford3/ld40/blob/master/sound/Distributor_Gameplay.wav"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Like a Boss Rush","category":"jam","description":"Remember all those games with moving pictures and sounds from when you were a kid?

You must trudge all the way to the furthest south-eastern most point to escape. Along the way you will encounter a great deal of some sort of sticky, smelly muck that you will have to trudge through as there is no way around it. Unfortunately this muck sticks to you, and when it's disturbed a strong odor emits from it that gets some maze creatures all riled up, causing them to have the seemingly insatiable desire to go for a jog through the maze. The more muck you disturb, the more likely it is that you'll encounter one of them -- or that they'll encounter you. While they probably won't chase you, as your paths cross it is likely they'll take a little nip (or maybe more than just a little), and your only defense is to run away.\n\nYou'll also find health packs scattered about to recouperate from those pesky bites, and flares that you can launch to briefly illuminate parts of the unknown maze. Good luck, you may or may not get out alive,but every maze is different...\n\n\n### Game Controls: \nNavigate with arrow keys, launch flares with the space bar.\n\nYou start with full health, no flares and no muck (like the clothespin nose icon on that power bar? hee hee) \nAs for muck, don't worry you'll find _PLENTY_ throughout the maze. Up to 30% of cells will contain some, and of those that do some will have enough to get you on up to three passes through that cell.\n\nHealth and flares are scattered randomly throughout the maze. Up to 15% of cells will have one of the other, and of those cells there's a 50-50 chance they'll have one or the other.  It's _likely_ you'll encounter both, but there is a chance that you won't encounter any in some mazes -- it's all random.\n\n\n#### Tools used:\n\n- Phaser JS game engine -- more specifically, [this starter project](https://github.com/rroylance/phaser-npm-webpack-typescript-starter-project) which took care of much of the overall _environment_ config.\n- Photoshop to draw the art assets\n- Texturepacker to prep spritesheets\n- Reaper for audio editing & timing of audio sprites\n- VS Code for the code editor\n\n#### Notes\n- This is my first game jam, and really the first completed game of any sort with graphics -- although it's a more complex reimagining of a basic maze crawler I built using a similar algorithm for an extra credit project in a Pascal class back in highschool (~24yrs ago, specifically).\n\n- There is no start menu, ran out of time to implement that.  But really all that would've been is a play button. The game will begin automatically after the intro screen, on win or death you'll just launch back into a new game again automatically. So while a menu would maybe be nice it's not a big loss to not have it. \n\n- I also did not get a chance to include control buttons for mobile devices which pretty much prevents playing on an ipad/etc.  Though it would be easy enough to add that in, just need buttons that trigger the same move function.\n\n- For the math geeks and technically interested folk; maze generation uses the classic [Prim's Algorithm](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/10/maze-generation-prim-s-algorithm).\n\n- Struggled a number of hours trying to get creature AI implemented so that they would actively seek the player out, that had several unfortunate results:\n\n   1. Actively running pathfinding logic for up to 100 creatures in a 1500 cell maze pretty reliably crashed the game or used so much processor that the game became entirely unresponsive\n\n   2. Most performant pathfinding algorithms seem to expect a different type of grid than the data structure used to maintain the maze structure, I'd have to experiment more to see if something like A* would work with the structure used (it's a 2-dimensional array representing cells in height & width, where each cell contains an array of 0/1 values for top, right, bottom & left walls.) It seems for things like A* to work I'd need a flat grid instead.\n\n   3. Using less intelligent seeking behavior resulted in creatures just deciding to stop moving, or exhibiting very stupid behavior (repeatedly moving between two cells indefinitely)\n\n   In the end, the \"AI\" is only intelligent enough to keep track of their own previous cell locations, and it then randomly selects any _other_ direction to move whenever possible. The result is that creatures very actively free-roam large swaths of the maze, and very little processing overhead is involved.  In testing I was able to have several hundred active creatures with no negative impact on game play (other than a ridiculous number of creatures in the maze!)\n\n   Ultimately not having the creatures actively seeking you out is beneficial, the game wouldn't be at all enjoyable with 100 creatures who always know exactly which way to go to find you. The existing implementation, albeit not smart about finding the player keeps it more fun, and gives you some semblance of a chance of finding the maze exit (lower right corner, always).","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f89/e/z/ad87.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/maze-trudger","author":{"name":"Colossal Gnome","uid":59791,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f89/e/z/be1a.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/colossal-gnome"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f89/e/z/adb1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f89/e/z/adb1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/willvincent/maze-trudger"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://colossalgnome.com/ld40/index.html"},{"label":"macOS","url":"http://colossalgnome.com/ld40/MazeTrudger-darwin-x64.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","mac","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Onion Rush","category":"jam","description":"/!\\ This is a local multiplayer Game /!\\\n\nYou have to chop the required amount of onions before your opponent.\nUse your knives to pick and then chop-chop the onions.\n\nThe more onions you slice, the more blurry is your vision.\nSome special onions can give you a bonus if you cut them or your bench or a malus for your opponent if you cut it on his bench.\n\nControls :\n\nLeft Joystick : Move your left hand.\n\nRight Joystick : Move your right hand.\n\nLB/RB : Chop Onions.\n\nRequires 2 x360 controllers.\n\n![ScreenShot2.png](///raw/3f2/6/z/ba68.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//3f2/6/z/ba9c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/onion-rush","author":{"name":"Juuules","uid":25331,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//3f2/6/z/b87d.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/juuules"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//3f2/6/z/ba68.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//3f2/6/z/ba68.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://xeros80.itch.io/onion-rush"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"The Beforlorne Wander","category":"compo","description":"Metroidvania thing!

Our first project for a Ludum Dare! It’s been a hard process, with some times of drama and some times of happiness. But in the end we managed our goal successfully! Enjoy! We’re ready for your ratings!\n\n**Controls:**\n\n    - Move: A/D  or Left/Right arrows\n\n    - Change shape: RightShift or LeftShift\n\n\n**The Game:**\n\nYour objective is to stay alive as long as possible, all the while completing the bars full of geometric shapes by adapting your shape and standing in the correct position. As time passes, more shapes will be added to the list and it will get harder to adapt! Show what you can do!\n\nPS: We have gotten a problem with the build resolution. We wanted the game to be 800x600 by default, but, when exporting, Unity would not let us. Anyway, you can resize the window manually to make it the shape you want to.\n\n![FIT_IN.png](///raw/e40/d/z/c416.png)\n\n**The Theme:**\n\nAs you all know, this Ludum Dare’s theme is “the more you have, the worse it is”. This got us thinking about excesses, and what are the most popular excesses in our western culture? The 7 deadly sins. From this train of thought, we created a mechanic for each deadly sin and, through a discarding process, chose the one we saw more fit. \n\nThe sin we chose to create our game from was “Envy”; the main mechanic in the game was inspired by the character “Envy” from Full Metal Alchemist, a personification of the sin itself.\nIn the game you play as someone envious, someone who can’t be happy by himself and has to adapt and fit in into every situation he’s presented with to feel better about himself, being someone he’s not.\n\nThe addition of more shapes to fit into and the neverending bars falling on top of the player make it so that, after a while, there are too many shapes for him to transform to and his desire to “fit in” crushes him.\n\nSwitching shapes is the focus of the game and, the more shapes there are to choose from, the harder the game becomes, because the player can only press one button to scroll through all the shapes. That’s why “the more you have, the worst it is”.\n\nWe hope you enjoy our small project.\nThank you for playing!\n\n\n![FIT_IN 2.png](///raw/e40/d/z/c466.png)\nMentions :\n\n**Music:** A Jumping Jack Frost remix from *Do You Know Where You're Coming From*- by M Beat and Jamiroquai\n\n**Sounds:** Edited with *LMMS*\n\n**Engine:** *Unity 2017.2.0f3* \n\n**Font:** *The Light Font*\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e40/d/z/c3e6.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/fit-in","author":{"name":"cachodragon","uid":53568,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//041/d/z/97aa.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/cachodragon"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e40/d/z/c416.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e40/d/z/c416.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e40/d/z/c466.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e40/d/z/c466.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://cachodragon.itch.io/fit-in"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Chaos Dart","category":"compo","description":"A top-down game where the more power ups you collect, the more enemies appear.

Featuring the awesome and critically acclaimed game system of loot boxes!\n\n![drop_rates.png](///raw/29a/3/z/b625.png)\n\nGame design\n===========\n\nYou are the owner of a little farm, growing cute chicken. Each chicken is a little tamagochi: **the more you have, the more you will have to take care**. On top of that, loot boxes appearing so often that you will have to open it, if only to see the screen. **The more you have unopened loot boxes, the harder it is** to take care of your chickens. As loot boxes drop new chickens, you are rapidly overwhelmed.\n\nAn interesting fact about the game design of this game is that it sets no goal. You cannot lose, you cannot win, there is not even any scoring. Yet, the overwhelming number of actions to do suffice to put the player in a rush for self stated goals (mainly keeping the chickens alive).\n\nTechnical performances\n======================\n\nTo move, chickens implement **steering behaviors**. It is a simple system to implement (great for game jams) featuring nice organic movements. For the chickens to not cross the fence, it is as simple as implementing a steering behavior pushing them away from it when they are near. To know how far a chicken is from a fence, the game solve the fence as a line equation of the form \"ax + bx + c = 0\", then compute the distance of the chicken using [this formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_from_a_point_to_a_line#Line_defined_by_an_equation).\n\nWhen we started the project, we did not though we would **use maths to reduce a fence to an equation**! It is quite challenging, and we are now better at mathematics :)\n\nUsed tools\n==========\n\nWe gone for a **100% Free and open source stack** for this jam.

But don't worry, if you toss your coin at a police robot or a dumpster, you can get it back.\nIf you get more than 10 coins, you can toss a coin bag which turns off the guards, but you can't have the coins back. Coin bags tossed at dumpster CAN be recovered.\nBut be careful! The more coins you have, the worse it gets!\nHeavy load of coins will make you slower, heavier (can't jump high enough) and you'll even fall from ropes.

Repeat. Ad infinitum.\n\n#### Controls\n- Drag items around to organize your inventory.\n- Move items between bags by dragging an item over a bag tab and releasing. \n- Click the sell button to trade the item in the Sale Box.\n- Click the Upgrade button to purchase the next upgrade. \n- You cannot sell multiple items at a time.\n- You can never sell monster parts, but heroes are happy to unload them on you!\n\n#### Tips\n- If you're about to run out of inventory room, worry not, your clientele are generous enough to supply you with a spare bag.\n- If you find your purse getting light, consider skipping heroes until you find one who will pay good money for one of your remaining items.\n- The Peddler buys valuable equipment before monster parts, so you'll always have something to sell.\n- Some items are worth a **WHOLE** lot more when given to the right hero. Sometimes, all you need to turn your fortunes is the right hero browsing your wares. \n- Organizing your inventory will make it easier to find the item the hero wants the most, and is willing to *pay* accordingly.\n- Look for benevolent adventurers whose generosity is as renowned as their heroism. Oh, but watch out for those Jerks.\n- You can't lose! The Peddler is always making those monies!

You can now complete the game!  You move faster, enemies move faster (and there are more of them), the weight mechanic is less cumbersome, and restart functions correctly.\n\nThe original jam version is labeled accordingly.\n\nControls:\n\nWASD to move.  \nShift to dash.  \nSpace to toggle larva call.  \nEscape for menu.  \nE to drop distraction cells.  \nPartial controller support (no menu interaction).  \n\nGather biomass from the green tanks and deliver it to your spawning pool to create larva.  Deliver those larva in turn to grates around the map to infest the research facility.  Once infestation is complete, you can escape into the world!\n\n...except you can't in the original upload, because colliders are not triggers.\n\nOhh man.  What have I done?  \n\nThe theme was the last one I expected to win.  I had lots of ideas for most the the themes, but uh... this one came out of left field for me.\n\nI decided to try to incorporate the theme in as many facets of the design as I could.  It is worse to have more minions following you because it's harder to sneak around.  It's worse to be burdened with an abundance of MacGuffin, because your movement is inhibited.  It's worse to allow enemies to bunch up, because, well, they are you enemies.  They want to eat you and all that.\n\nI am not thrilled with the finished product.  You can play it through, so that's good.  I probably won't revisit this particular project (LD spaghetti all over the place), but I have learned A TON about pixel art and the associated concerns.  I would really like to move forward with another, more tolerably-paced pixel art project.\n\nAnyway, I hope there's some fun to be had with Infestus.  I had fun making it.

Hit a B.B. and once you land, you'll be sorry. ​How far can you fling?\n\n---\n\n## Developer Notes:\n\nConsidering the time constraints, I wanted to keep the game's scope small. Ultimately, that leads to some shortcomings. For example, every time you play, you get a new layout to play, but, you're always shooting to beat a single high score. Ideally, I would have had time to implement actual levels to beat.\n\nI also don't know how to get the WebGL effects looking sharper. Nor did I have time to add a spiffy soundtrack.\n\nNeedless to say, the actual code leaves a bit to be desired. 24 hours means it's time to throw out my software engineering best practices and just start hacking.\n\nBut, overall, I'm happy with what I've accomplished and I'm looking forward to using Tri-Angle as a basis for future games :-) \n\n---\n\n## Tools:\n\n* Unity 2017.1\n* Inkscape\n* Audacity\n\n---\n\n## Screen Shots:\n![QuadImage.png](///raw/03a/d/z/a3fe.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//03a/d/z/a10b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/tri-angle","author":{"name":"FussenKuh","uid":55856,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/fussenkuh"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//03a/d/z/a3d6.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//03a/d/z/a3d6.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//03a/d/z/a3fe.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//03a/d/z/a3fe.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://fussenkuh.itch.io/tri-angle"},{"label":"Android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FussenKuh.TriAngle"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","mobile"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"DaisyChain Galaxy","category":"jam","description":"\n# A Rubber-Bandy Arcade Game\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rzWBzWH7lc0\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f02/2/z/bd73.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/daisychain-galaxy","author":{"name":"brittbrady","uid":8727,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//712/2/z/968a.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/brittbrady"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://cowboycolor.itch.io/daisychaingalaxy"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Junk","category":"compo","description":"![Junk.gif](///raw/36d/b/z/a5c9.gif)\n\nThe more you have, the worse it is *for other people*.\n\nJunk is a variation of the familiar falling-blocks puzzle game.

This is my first submission to ludum dare, and I have to say I'm quite pleased with the way it turned out! The game is a tile-based building game where you try to gain as much money (or last as long) as possible. By expanding your mining network, you will gain more money to help you expand further. However, the machines you take advantage of also cause pollution, and this has very negative effects on the environment. This comes in the form of tornadoes that will come and destroy your mining network.\n\nSee how long you can last before the tornadoes destroy your empire!\n\n![apocolypsecorpgame.png](///raw/697/1/z/b0ee.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//697/1/z/b090.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/apocalypse-corp","author":{"name":"Chipmonkey","uid":6038,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//697/1/z/9634.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/chipmonkey"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//697/1/z/b099.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//697/1/z/b099.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//697/1/z/b0ee.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//697/1/z/b0ee.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source

When an ally is revived via this method, they convert back to being a monster after a small amount of time and come back as an even stronger enemy.  The idea was, you can use allies, but the more you have the worse the difficulty.\n\nEverything in this game was created **from scratch** between 9PM Friday (December 1, 2017) and 9PM Sunday (December 3, 2017).\n\n## Controls\n- WASD to move\n- E to inject antidote into a dead mutant (only green bodies can be revived)\n- C to destroy a body (beat to a pulp)\n- Mouse to aim, left click to shoot\n- P pauses and un-pauses\n\n## Screenshots\n![screen1.png](///raw/5ec/2/z/ab7c.png)\n![screen2.png](///raw/5ec/2/z/ab81.png)\n![screen3.png](///raw/5ec/2/z/ab87.png)\n\n## Issues\n- The body beat functionality is extremely timid looking\n- Sound effects may be missing from some actions\n\n## Completed Features\n- Game director-esque feature to send enemies as you progress through the level\n- Ability to \"revive\" dead mutants by pressing E to turn them into an ally soldier (see above *Convert* enemy)\n- Ability to \"beat\" dead bodies.  This removes the bodies from the game, so they cannot be consumed by the bagger enemies.  See the bagger enemy features listed under planned features for more details on why this was originally added.\n- Blocking objects in road\n- Scrolling map\n- Finale event\n- Game win, lose, and main menu screens\n- 4 enemy types\n    - Basic Mutant\n        - These are the slow green guys that waddle around\n    - Bagger\n        - A bug like enemy that devours bodies to become stronger.  See below for his original plan.\n    - Snek\n        - A snake like monster that fires spit at you.  He will attack from range unless he is within a certain distance.\n    - Convert\n        - A revived ally will \"convert\" back into a monster after a random amount of time(he has tentacles burst through his stomach)\n- Allies that follow you around, including aiming their gun where they shoot\n- Animations for anything and everything\n- Medkits spawn randomly, pickup for health\n- *TurboGun/ChainGun* pickup, greatly increases the rate of fire for a number of bullets\n- Score tracking and distance tracking\n- Sound effects for various actions and enemies\n\n\n## Planned features that did not make it\n- More objects to spawn in the road (some bullet blocking and some explosive)\n- Map was supposed to stop scrolling when the director \"fired\" events, but it was causing some weird jerkiness if you were standing on the right side when the scroll was re-enabled.  Therefore I just removed the temporary scroll locks and the lock only occurs during the finale.\n- Bagger evolution implementation\n    - The bagger enemy (Guy that steals bodies) is supposed to morph into a stronger aggressive enemy when he gathers so many bodies. His default behavior is to gather bodies and escape off screen, returning later as a stronger enemy based on the number of bodies he gathered. His escape behaviour is disabled so that he can be found and killed due to the second version of him not being complete.\n- Atleast one boss \n    - The finale DOES exist, you CAN win the game if you get to it and kill everything.  Originally there were going to be two bosses, however time did not allow for that to happen.\n- Local score tracking/leaderboard\n- Random events throughout level progression (i.e. helicopter crash with upgrades)\n- Better variety of weapon pickups\n- Try out reloading mechanism\n\n\n## Technical details\nThis was my first ever Game Jam, and it was awesome!  I opted for the Compo to challenge myself and force more creativity by exploring every aspect of game dev (sounds I'm looking at you).\n\nI created this using CraftyJS (http://craftyjs.com/).  I had never used this library prior to this game, so I lost some time learning it, but what's the point of the LD if not to learn?\n\nhttp://sfbgames.com/chiptone was used for sfx creation.  Great tool for quick sounds.\n\nhttp://soundtrap.com was used for creating the background music.\n\nI used Piskel (https://www.piskelapp.com/) to create all of my sprites.  It did a **fantastic** job and was a life saver.\n\nGIMP was used at the end to create quick single images (i.e. box/car objects, menus, and logo)\n\nGithub is obviously hosting the code, the game can be played directly at https://adrenallen.github.io/ld40/","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//5ec/2/z/ab76.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/mutoid","author":{"name":"Adrenallen","uid":11493,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/adrenallen"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//5ec/2/z/ab8f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//5ec/2/z/ab8f.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//5ec/2/z/ab7c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//5ec/2/z/ab7c.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//5ec/2/z/ab81.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//5ec/2/z/ab81.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//5ec/2/z/ab87.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//5ec/2/z/ab87.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://adrenallen.github.io/ld40/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Escape the dungeon.","category":"jam","description":"![logo.png](///raw/ad2/2/z/ce6a.png)\nYou have to escape a dungeon.

Also do you like the texts written through the program-translator? Forgive me for this, I am an alien and my ship crashed on this wonderful planet. Fortunately, the locals considered me a god and helped with the repair of the spacecraft. Now I have to help them get the Great Cheese from the sky (mgh, more precisely the Moon). They are simple people, so we will build a tower of goblins. With goblins as a binder. The hands, legs and powerful jaws will come together, you just need to put them on top of each other. Do not forget about the impact of wind and birds, of course. We are serious scientists.\n\n# Rules of the game\nControl the ship, hurl the goblins at each other. Do not miss the tower, otherwise you will lose. Do not let goblins touch the right and left edges of the screen, otherwise the tower will fall apart.\n\n# Controls\n![controls2.png](///raw/206/1/z/d78f.png)\n* Control the space ship by clicking on the **arrows** to the right and to the left.\n* Press the **spacebar** to drop the goblin.

That means:\n\n* Red towers cannot attack red, yellow and magenta enemies\n* Green towers cannot attack green, yellow and cyan enemies\n* Blue towers cannot attack blue, cyan and magenta enemies\n* Yellow towers cannot attack yellow enemies\n* Cyan towers cannot attack cyan enemies\n* Magenta towers cannot attack magenta enemies\n* Gray towers can attack enemies of any color, but have a 75% damage output\n* The only white tower can attack enemies of any color, and has a 200% damage output\n\nYou can also upgrade your towers. Via upgrading, you can increase your damage output, range, fire rate or effectivity of the tower.\n\n![tutorial3.PNG](///raw/141/8/z/bf5e.png)\n\n* Laser tower: Damage and range is upgradable\n* Slowing tower: Range and effectivity is upgradable\n* AOE tower: Damage and range is upgradable\n* Shooting tower: Damage, range and fire rate is upgradable\n\nAt the upgrade page you can also modify the targeting behaviour of the towers. You can select whether the tower should target\n\n* The closest enemy to the tower\n* The closest enemy to the center tile\n* The enemy with the lowest amount of health\n* The enemy with the highest amount of health.\n\nYou can also specify per tower which types of enemies to target. This way, you can created advanced defense schematics to perfect your damage output.\n\nEvery 4 rounds the size of the level increases, so does the number of spawn points. Enemies spawn on any of the gray tiles, every 0.5 seconds.\n\nIn the building phase, you can see the number of enemies in the next round, as well as the types and colors of the enemies at the bottom of the screen.\n\nYou can advance by clicking the `Start wave` button.\n\nYou can zoom in/out with the mouse wheel, and you can pan the camera around by simply clicking and dragging.\n\nYou can build towers by clicking on an empty tile, and you can upgrade towers by clicking on their tile.\n\nEvery time one of your towers kills an enemy, you get a single unit of resource of their color. You can see the number of resources you own on the left side of the screen.\n\nIn the building phase, you can see all of the routes enemies can take from the spawning points. You can manipulate these routes by blocking them. You **cannot** block all routes though, trying to do so will result in completely nothing, you just cannot build a tower in a way so that no possible routes exist to the center tile. Also, you cannot build on gray tiles.\n\nI hope I could explain the core mechanics and the controls of the game well enough to make it playable.\n\nHave fun :)\n\n![progress8.PNG](///raw/141/8/z/bfa8.png)\n\nNOTE: The font used in the game is Proggy Clean TT.\n\nWith much thanks to my buddy Győző, who helped me with the graphics stuff in the game.

That's definitely not the game as I imagined it, with a ton of unfinished features, but I still like it. I was really late to make any real tutorials or make it visually understandable, so I'll just say it here - the game is about inflation.

Your job is it to defend your Core / Missile Silo, till you have the cash to launch your Nuclear Rocket to smash your foes. \n\nFor this purpose you can build different Towers which will help you to defend your base.\n\n## Tower\n![Towers_Low.gif](///raw/7b5/2/z/be18.gif)\n\nThe first tower is the basic tower. It will grant you some small damage for a low price.\n\nThe second one is the piercing tower, which will cost a bit more but will provide a better damage output and on top, it will ignore the armor of your enemies\n\nThe last, but not the least tower, is the lightning tower which has the biggest amount of damage output and will also ignore the whole shield of the enemy units. \n\nBUT BEWARE, every tower you build will also power up your enemies. Each tower will add additional units to the next wave of your enemy. Even when you upgrade your tower, which will provide more damage and a better attack speed, will also raise the amount of added enemy units.\n\n## Units\n![Units_Low.gif](///raw/7b5/2/z/be19.gif)\n\nThe first unit is the standard unit, with a touch of armor and small health. But these guys can be dangerous in a big amount.\n\nThe next unit is the Crawler which is the fastet unit of our enemy. It has also just a touch of armor but already a nice shield. And you also should not forget the bigger amount of health of this unit.\n\nThe third unit is the dreaded Mech. This collos of machine has a lot health and the shield and armor of this unit is enormous.\n\nBut thanks to our sponsors, every killed unit will provide us a bit money to build more tower and improve your existing ones.\n\n## Nuclear Missile\n\nYour goal is clear. Defend the silo, save some money and launch the nuclear missile. \nAfter you have launched the missile we just have to wait and survive the last enemy units till the rocket will crush our enemy and we win this fight. \n\nWhen there are too many units reach our base, they will be killed by our men in the base but everyone of them will explode, so that our core silo is damaged. If it has too much damage you will loose this fight.\n\n## The more you have, the worse it is\nOur war is not easy. As already mentioned will the enemy army grow for every tower you build or improve.\n\nNext to that, the enemy army will improve from wave to wave, so don't be lazy and keep an eye on the enemies.\n\nMore important is also, that needed money has also a drawback. The more money you have, the more units will follow our enemies. So that the army of our foe will grow with every coin in our pocket. \n\n\n## Control\n![Tutorial.png](///raw/7b5/2/z/bef1.png)\n\nControl the Camera by using the keys \n- \"W\" Up\n- \"S\" Down\n- \"A\" Left\n- \"D\" Right\n\n- \"1\" Quickselect Basic Tower\n- \"2\" Quickselect Piericing Tower\n- \"3\" Quickselect Lightning Tower\n\n- \"Space\" Quickselect Upgrade Mode\n- \"Esc\" Quickselect Pause Menu\n\nTo build a tower, choose the relevant tower via mouse or quickselects and click then on a greenish field.\nTo upgrade a tower, switch to the upgrade mode via mouse or quickselect and click then on an existing tower.\nThe Nuclear Button in the bottom left will launch the nuclear missile.\n\n\n## Team:\n**Christian**\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/key_user\n\n**Christian**\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/DeathStorm1987\n- Web: http://weird-mind.com\n\n## Downloads\n- (Linux & Mac are untested!)\n\n\n![TFN_01.png](///raw/7b5/2/z/bf81.png)\n\n![TFN_03.png](///raw/7b5/2/z/bf84.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7b5/2/z/c18b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/towers-for-nuclear","author":{"name":"DeathStorm","uid":9655,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/deathstorm"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7b5/2/z/bf86.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7b5/2/z/bf86.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7b5/2/z/be18.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7b5/2/z/be18.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7b5/2/z/be19.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7b5/2/z/be19.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7b5/2/z/bef1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7b5/2/z/bef1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7b5/2/z/bf81.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7b5/2/z/bf81.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7b5/2/z/bf84.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7b5/2/z/bf84.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/1t75bjbwn7rxk9h/LD40%20-%20Towers%20for%20Nuclear_WIN.zip?dl=0"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/n237ph6iqex0dbx/Mac_Universal.rar?dl=0"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/p3xpvz86gytptvx/LD40%20-%20Towers%20for%20Nuclear_linux.zip?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Wall Run","category":"compo","description":"This is a game all about running from a wall of lava, which gains speed when you get coins.

The hook is that when a human piecetakes a zombie piece it's removed from the board, but when a zombie piece takes a human piece that piece is turned into a zombie and moved to the taking's pieces previous position. As the game progresses and you lose more human pieces the game becomes even harder for the humans to win.\n\nThe game is two-player hotseat. No AI or online anything.

Your backpack will be really heavy, but you can take your coins and throw them to new places! drop your backpack and use it to climb up high ledges, or do whatever else you might need to do, to achieve victory in King of Coins!\n\nDEV NOTES:\nThis was a fun game to make. I took me two days to complete, and a lot of that time was spent during nights. I almost regret it, because I am really busy with school work. But it was really fun to program a game, as it's been a while since I last did it.\nI am very happy with how the sound effects turned out. All of them was made by me on a Zoom H1 microphone. It really gave the coins a satisfaction to them that I enjoy greatly.\n\nKNOWN BUGS:\n- The display icon that hovers over backpacks will disappear sometimes if you reload the scene.\nThe game will still be beatable, but if it bugs you, reload again, and it might come back.\n- If you have too many coins on the screen, any text will glitch out.\n\n![5.png](///raw/0e9/a/z/b9a8.png)\n![4.png](///raw/0e9/a/z/b9ab.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0e9/a/z/b993.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/king-of-coins","author":{"name":"SandPile","uid":43488,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0e9/a/z/96a0.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/sandpile"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0e9/a/z/b9a8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0e9/a/z/b9a8.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0e9/a/z/b9ab.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0e9/a/z/b9ab.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/13vqywwue906v28/KingOfCoinsV2.zip?dl=0#"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Rhythm Bandit","category":"compo","description":"Get to the exit with as many items as you can.

The deeper you go, the tougher the climb. Made in 48 hours using Pico-8. (Actually more like 36.) [Play on itch.io!](https://isogash.itch.io/find-gold)\n\n![ezgif-4-84a2bb1e02.gif](///raw/345/e/z/b27f.gif)\n\n### CONTROLS\n\n**Z**/**Up** - Jump  \n**X** - Grab/Throw  \n**Left**/**Right** - Move  \n**Down** - Stay low during jump  \n\n### BEHIND THE SCENES\n\nThis game was built on some platformer code I've been working on before. I want to make a full Pico-8 engine and this was a useful test case to see where my engine design would fall short (and fall short it did)! The code more than doubled in size to accommodate collisions, the level traversal and the picking up mechanic. The engine itself is very \"gameobject\" oriented, but I found that this style is unnecessary and might be more optimal with shared components and some kind of inheritence.\n\nIn the end, it was a struggle against the physics bugs, and a fight against the engine to implement features that made the game fun. I wanted to get more out of the \"you can only pick things up\" mechanic, such as a box that dropped a bomb every time you jumped on it, the permanent whip upgrade and the magnet (although gold isn't magnetic). The bounce box was the only special item that made it into the game. In the end, it would have been incredibly hard to create unique opportunities for each item. The bounce box is made redundant by stacking the normal boxes (or corpses).\n\nI like that dying a lot makes it (sometimes) easier. If you want a ridiculous challenge, try beating the game with 0 deaths!\n\nI didn't really have enough time to playtest level 4, so it's a bit too hard and unfair in my opinion. I wanted to get around 6 levels in but I ran out of time. I probably should have cut it at 3 levels to make it more achievable and fun. If you beat the game, I commend you!\n\n#### Changelog\n\nVersion 4:\n\n* Fixed a crash when enemies fell into lava.\n\nVersion 3:\n\n* Made death sound quieter due to complaints.\n\nVersion 2:\n\n* Fixed a bug where boxes were respawning inside levels they didn't belong to.\n* Removed an unfair enemy.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//345/e/z/ba1a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/find-gold","author":{"name":"Isogash","uid":58691,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/isogash"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//345/e/z/b27f.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//345/e/z/b27f.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://funrom.co.uk"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://funrom.co.uk/findgold_win.zip"},{"label":"macOS","url":"http://funrom.co.uk/findgold_mac.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://funrom.co.uk/findgold_linux.zip"},{"label":"Source code","url":"http://funrom.co.uk/findgold.p8"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Kalyuka","category":"compo","description":"So, is my first time at ludum-dare.

Your score improves if you keep more people alive and more fragile items intact.\n\nThe theme for this Ludum Dare Jam is *\"The more you have, the worse it is\"*, so I made the player able to carry all the babies at the same time if the player wishes, but each baby adds weight and makes every step and jump harder than the one before, so the player has to make plans on how to get those babies back to safety.\n\nThis game can be played with a keyboard, but a controller is highly recommended, since a lot of the jumps are difficult and get even harder the more babies you are carrying. There are double jumps, walljumps, throwing babies downwards give you a small air boost, you can throw and catch babies mid air, you can jump downwards too.\n\n*Music and sfx will be added in the post-jam version, along with tons of items, levels and gamemodes.*\n\n## CONTROLS:\n### Keyboard:\n- **W, A, S, D:** Movement.\n- **E:** Pick babies up, or if no baby is nearby to be picked up, drop or throw babies.\n- **W, Spacebar:** Jump.\n- **R:** Restart the game.\n\n### Gamepad:\n- **Directional Pad:** Movement.\n- **Y:** Pick babies up, or if no baby is nearby to be picked up, drop or throw babies.\n- **A:** Jump.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## LINKS:\n### HTML5:\n- https://killerkun.itch.io/babies-with-guns\n\n\n[UPDATES]\n[SUBMISSION] So I only missed getting the audio in for a quick replayable experience, I still have a bit of a problem fixing the walljumps, sometimes they don't seem to stick, but other than that I think it came out *decent*... I will most definitely keep developing this idea further after the Jam is over.\n\n[UPDATE 2] Pretty much all the basic stuff and graphics are in place, now I just have to set up a few level completion conditions, some audio and music and create at least a couple of levels. I got to say that I feel that the movement is pretty satisfying, and the load of the babies does make it a bit frustrating after getting used of moving like a ninja.\n\n![Screenshot-2017-12-3 Created with GameMaker Studio2.png](///raw/64d/2/z/bd47.png)\n\n[UPDATE 1] So I just finished the basic movements and picking and dropping babies system, just gotta make some destructables, some innocent npcs to be killed and a few hazards for it to be at a playable state, the rest is just making the sprites and getting audio in. I don't think I will have the time to get a menu of any sort in time.\n\n![Screenshot-2017-12-3 Created with GameMaker Studio.png](///raw/64d/2/z/a3ca.png)\n\n[FIRST POST]Alright so here's the pitch:\n\n*There are some babies with guns scattered around, you have to pick them all up and carry them to a safe place where they can't cause damage, but the more babies you carry at the same time, the worse things get.*\n\n*The goal is to finish each level in the shortest amount of time while causing minimal destruction.*\n\nTime to start making this game.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//64d/2/z/cae3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/babies-with-guns","author":{"name":"killerkun","uid":11590,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//64d/2/z/34ad.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/killerkun"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//64d/2/z/ccf3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//64d/2/z/ccf3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//64d/2/z/bd47.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//64d/2/z/bd47.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//64d/2/z/a3ca.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//64d/2/z/a3ca.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://killerkun.itch.io/babies-with-guns"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Rocket Jump","category":"compo","description":"![Rocket Jump 2017-12-04 02-59-31-47.png](///raw/e84/a/z/b016.png)\n![Rocket Jump 2017-12-04 02-56-29-60.png](///raw/e84/a/z/b01d.png)\n![Rocket Jump 2017-12-04 03-00-49-62.png](///raw/e84/a/z/b021.png)\n![Rocket Jump 2017-12-04 02-57-52-42.png](///raw/e84/a/z/b025.png)\nYour goal is to get to the end of level using your rocket launcher.

When you got there, you found out that this rumor IS true. And you quickly find out that, the more shapes there are, the more likely you are to suffocate.\n\n**GAMEPLAY**\n\nThis game is an Arcade/Platformer Shooter. You have a gun and 7 bombs that you have to use in order to defend yourself from the onslaught of shapes.\n\n**CONTROLS:**\n\nW, A, S, D: Move\n\nSpace: Jump\n\nLeft Click (with gun): Shoot/Scroll through text\n\nRight Click: Bomb\n\nM: Mute music\n\n\n**BEHIND THE SCENES**\n\nThis game was made for the Ludum Dare 40 Compo. It was quite a stressful journey, but I'm happy that I managed to make it here.\nI've always wanted to participate in a game jam, ESPECIALLY Ludum Dare. Now I have the chance, and the theme didn't suck as much as Ludum Dare 38, which I was ORIGINALLY going to participate in.\n\n\"Participate\". Well I wasn't going to ACTUALLY participate, I just would've ACTED like I was in the competition.\n\nYou might realize that Jake's walking animation might be a little weird, and the music might suck balls. That's because I don't have much experience with walking animations and music.\n\nI didn't even put on a shirt for most of the jam in order to save time and also, it got quite hot in my room. During the jam, I got EXTREMELY stressed out. This even carried on to when I was 'asleep'. I even had a mini-nightmare which involved the deadline being 17 minutes after I 'woke' up. Later on, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to provide a download link before the Compo ended.\n\n\nAnyways, I hope you all enjoy playing my game. I certainly poured my soul into it.\n\n**PROGRAMS USED:**\n\nClickteam Fusion 2.5 (Game)\n\nGIMP (Player, Logo, Final Cover image)\n\nAudacity (Sounds, Music variations)\n\nBosca Ceoil (Music Creation)\n\nInkscape (Tracing Cover Image)\n\nBlender (Raw Cover Image)\n\nBFXR (Sound Effects)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a9d/e/z/9e84.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/shape-invasion","author":{"name":"RonanRorry","uid":60826,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a9d/e/z/b51a.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/ronanrorry"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a9d/e/z/9e8a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a9d/e/z/9e8a.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jKnkOkSZQjoDqT0kNAE2cutHvNLcRznz/view?usp=sharing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Rabbit Farmer!!!","category":"compo","description":"In the coming future, the population is growing really fast!

Now one stereotypical badass 80’s video game guy will defeat them the only way he knows how… with punches! Filled with unbeatable spirit, their advanced squirrel tech can't stop him, only slow him down.  He is determined to punch as many squirrels as he can before he is overwhelmed by pure squirrel might, with their nasty, big, pointy, teeth!\"\n\nInstructions:\n\nRun through waves of squirrels and take down as many as you can. As time goes on, the alarm number goes up, the game gets faster and harder. Getting hit and defeating squirrels will also make the alarm rise. When it reaches a certain number(either 1000, 2000, or 4000 by run selection), the game will end and you can see your score. One run should most likely last from 5-15 minutes, depending largely on run selection and ability.\n\nControls:\n \n-Click on the screen to punch that location. Use arrow keys(or WASD) to move around.\n\n-Rapidly punch blue spots when they appear to do damage to the squirrel.\n \n-When yellow bullets appear, punch them to block them or you will get hit by them.\n\n-Use arrow keys(or WASD) to move around. Use this to avoid the directions that flash red or get hit. (staying in the center and not moving will also result in being hit)\n\nTips:\n\n-You can punch/click the yellow bullets away at any point after they are shot, even when they are really small.\n\n-The red attack pulses exactly 5 times before inflicting a hit. Move to the non-blinking side by then.\n\n-If the click location is off, try scrolling to the top of the page or enabling full screen mode.\n\n-The difficult curb on all runs is the same, the game just ends at earlier. Runs with higher numbers take longer and are more difficult by the end. Nearing 4000, the game becomes very difficult to borderline impossible.\n\nBackground:\n\nAnother Compo down. I must say, I did not care for the theme this Dare. \"The more you have, the worse it is\" kind of describes most games when you think about it (while you gain levels and such, the game becomes more difficult overall). I was just going to nix the theme this time around but I ended up incorporating some into this game anyways.To stray away from my tenancy of making slow-paced games, I decided to make a boxing style game. I wanted to make one similar to punch out but I changed that idea for the sake of time. This game has all the core mechanics but no time to make custom boss fights or anything. It sort of plays like a mix between a boxing game and a bullet hell, using the mouse to deflect bullets while dodging around with keys. There are three different types of squirrels, though they all use variations of the same core attack pattern. I'd like build on these mechanics and make custom bosses, like in punch-out, whether or not I keep the squirrel theme. I think there is potential in it. \n\nHow I made this game:\n\nI made this game using just HTML and Javascript in Atom, no game-making software just many lines of code. The graphics were done in Photoshop, SFX in sfxr, and the music was assembled using sample loops in FL Studios.\n\nKnown issues:\n\n-There might be a problem when the screen is scrolled that upsets the offset, causing the click location to be off. (This could not be resolved by standard means by the deadline) This does not seem to affect embedded or full screen modes though. (I'm not sure if this counts as a \"game breaking glitch\" that I am allowed to work on at this point in the compo)\n\n-While paused, the action stops, but the alarm number and time will still go up. This is not actually a \"glitch\" but intended as a feature when I was planing on adding upgrades and such. Just to deter people from pausing too long on a run or by using the pause to plan their actions.\n![Screenshot2.png](///raw/ed1/3/z/b3f3.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ed1/3/z/b345.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/squirrel-puncher-4000","author":{"name":"valkling-friend-of-all-things","uid":12766,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ed1/3/z/939d.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/valkling-friend-of-all-things"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ed1/3/z/b3f1.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ed1/3/z/b3f1.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ed1/3/z/b3f3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ed1/3/z/b3f3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://valkling.itch.io/squirrel-puncher-4000"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/703030"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"All-You-Can-Loot Cavern","category":"compo","description":"There is a cavern full of treasure beyond belief.

[page on itch.io](https://papacheech.itch.io/cowquest).\n\n\nCowquest is a simple game about defending your heard of cows, using a variety of weird resources and abilities. I think you'll quickly grow addicted. \n\nThe goal of the game was to make things exponentially tougher and more chaotic the more you progress, and the more cows that you are managing. Since they can poop explosives, things can get ... hectic when you have more friends!\n\nInspired by Spelunky, I based the mechanics off a simple set of physics rules. As it turns out, the possibilities within this system were pretty vast. When I ran out of arrows, I still had an option at my disposal:\n\n\n\n### Controls\n\nWASD: Move\n\nMouse: Aim\n\nLeft Click: Use Item\n\nQ: Drop\n\nE: Pickup\n\nSpace: Throw Item\n\nMouse Wheel: Change Item\n\n1-9: Item Hotkeys\n\n\n\n\n# Development\n\n\n\n![bowthrow.gif](///raw/ef5/4/z/c49a.gif)\n\n\n\n### Engine\n\nI used Unity to make the game, and managed to get pretty far with their new 2D tilemapping tools making the destructible terrain. Check it out, the results were pretty good:\n\n\n![destruction.gif](///raw/ef5/4/z/c4cd.gif)\n\n\n### Art!\n\nFor the sprites, I used Aseprite. I have a custom script to export my spritesheets straight to Unity, because my only gripe with the program is that the file system is kind of clunky. This saved me quite a bit of time. The tutorials I found [here](blog.studiominiboss.com/pixelart) have given me so much good info and changed how I think about spriting, so check them out!\n\n### Sound?\n\nI use Logic Express to make all my music. This little ditty just sort of popped into my head. I'd like to fix it up and put it on SoundCloud sometime after the jam. For the sounds, of course I used BFXR. It's a game jam, after all.\n\n## Endnotes\n\nI make a lot of games about cows. But I think this one is extra beefy. I hope you enjoy it!

Unfortunately, you only have the energy to care for so many pets, so watch out! You can sell a pet to an NPC by walking up to it, and then your energy will be restored.\n\nThe game is coded in C using SDL2 for graphics (https://libsdl.org) and I drew the assets in GIMP (https://gimp.org).

If it does fill up, you explode in an arcane explosion. :O\n\nYou move with WASD, and cast spells with the following key combinations: \n- Jump: UP, DOWN, UP.\n- Unlock door: LEFT, UP, RIGHT. \n- Fireball: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\n![pitfall.PNG](///raw/7c4/2/z/a50d.png)\n\nAs can be seen on the screenshot, there are some UI elements to help you as you go. \n\nThe spells do require a certain amount of mana to cast, and there are \"depletion crystals\" to empty your bar throughout the map. Hoping it won't be too difficult. :)\n\nThe goal is to reach the end, where you will find a bigger \"depletion crystal\", which will drain you of all magical powers  and save you from a horrible fate... \n\n![depletionCrystal.png](///raw/7c4/2/z/a55e.png)\n\nThe compo has been most challenging, but also very fun. \n\nTools I have been using: \n- Unity. \n- PyxelEdit. \n- ChipTone.\n- Gimp (For the cover photo).\n\nThe font is Cratense by Lucélia Barbosa, and is according to DaFont.com 100% free. \n\nSome known bugs:\n- The player sometimes get stuck when moving from one tile to the next one. I have tried googling around but couldn't seem to find any viable solutions. \n\nThank you for playing, and have a great day! :)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7c4/2/z/a49a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/wild-surge","author":{"name":"R33an1","uid":9415,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/r33an1"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7c4/2/z/a54e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7c4/2/z/a54e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7c4/2/z/a50d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7c4/2/z/a50d.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7c4/2/z/a55e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7c4/2/z/a55e.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/gmvohu2bgt9v842/Wild%20Surge%20-%20LD40.zip?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"The Nova Scotia Bilge Pump Company","category":"compo","description":"![PumpCompanyTitle.png](///raw/d46/e/z/aaeb.png)\n\nCaptain Tod doesn't use a bilge pump, and now he finds himself 25 miles from shore at the heart of St. Margaret's Bay with a storm coming in! get to shore before the boat floods.\n\n\n![GamePlay.png](///raw/d46/e/z/aaed.png)\nA goes left D goes right","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d46/e/z/a684.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/the-nova-scotia-bilge-pump-company","author":{"name":"Halouverite","uid":58957,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/halouverite"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d46/e/z/aaeb.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d46/e/z/aaeb.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d46/e/z/aaed.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d46/e/z/aaed.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://mpeatch.itch.io/the-nova-scotia-bilge-pump-company"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://mpeatch.itch.io/the-nova-scotia-bilge-pump-company"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Keep them under control!!!","category":"jam","description":"Somewhat unfinished, but still a little gem.

We do. Do you like bratwurst? We do. Prove your love by eating as much as you can before things get too uncomfortable.

Each piece of food you eat will raise your energy AND score you one point.  When you swallow the food, it moves over to your stomach, where you must use our patented Tummy Gun to shoot the brats and keep them from falling into your stomach acid. This is bad, as it triggers your acid reflux and causes the stomach acid to rise. Fortunately, if you allow a piece of celery to fall into the acid, the acid level will drop (veggies are good for you).\n\nDon’t let your energy drop down too low or your stomach acid to rise too high or you will have a bad time (and it’s game over).

(Only 4 available in the Alpha Build). Fire, Water, Thunder, Wind, Light and Dark.\n\nEach of these skills is unique.\n\n**Fire** has the user shoot a fireball in front of them in a line.\n\n**Water** creates a barrier around the user that dampens damage.\n\n**Thunder** creates a powerful bolt that splits in two and acts as an AOE kind of attack.\n\n**Wind** allows the user to move faster for a set amount of time.\n\n**Light** creates shields that prevent the enemy from going through, they weaken overtime.\n\n**Dark** allows the user to teleport away from their current location.\n\n\n### Controls\n\nYou can use a Gamepad for this game, however, Joysticks will currently not work.  \n**Keyboard:**\n\nLeft / Right - Move  \n\nSpace - Jump  \n\nZ - Power  \n\nEnter - Skill Tree  \n\nBackspace - Pause  \n\nX - Cancel  \n\nL / R - Switch Powers  \n\nF7 & F8 - Scale Window Up / Down\n\nF10 - Fullscreen\n\nMouse Wheel, Zoom in and our.\n\n  \n### Known Issues:\n\nThere are still a few issues with the game which are being ironed out.  \n\n**Enemy AI** - When a Slime attacks, sometimes it knocks the player flying into the air or the player doesn't get knocked back. (Invincibility Frames help here)\n\n**Enemy AI** - Slimes Hate Slopes for some reason, possibly something to do with the shape of the Hitbox.\n\n**Powers** - Water and Wind don't update instantly after you rank them up and need to be reused once they wear off.\n\n**Powers** - Sparks don't have gravity which means that slimes can fill trenches making it impossible to pass.\n\n**Camera** - During the Title, the camera pans to the player even though the camera is position at the player. \n\n![2017_12_3_21_47_52_0.png](///raw/3e4/5/z/a52f.png)\n\n![2017_12_3_21_48_38_0.png](///raw/3e4/5/z/a530.png)\n\n\nHere is a video of the Alpha at the end of Day 1.  \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7GH3p2YkRk\n\n\n*Alpha Build has no audio or sound effects.

The concept is that you’re a mind-reader who regains his thought power (ammo) by reading people’s minds. The more bad thoughts you get in your head, the tougher the enemies get, and the more you slow down due to emotional baggage. I intend to continue working on this after the jam and animating environment/music/post-processing changes to make it more distorted as you gain bad thoughts. The only way to make it better is to share in thoughts of love by reading the minds of positive people :)\n\nThis was my very first game jam and I had so much fun working with this theme, as well as meeting some amazing people (via Twitch and the LDJam blog); Although I went at it solo, I never felt alone in this for one minute.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm uploading a bit earlier than expected, so it's all placeholder right now (see the 'Notes' section of the game for more information), but I plan to continue working on this toward a full release, as I completely fell in love with this concept! Another team needs music for their submission and I volunteered to compose a couple of themes for them! I figured it would be better to help others make their project a little more special than throw some glitter on this turd of mine lol :D\n\nI definitely made some first-timer mistakes, such as not sleeping for the first 2 days, and prioritizing the wrong parts of my game, but all-in-all, this was an utter blast to be a part of!

I feel inclined to say \"I *finally* did it\", but considering how many people are still working away, that just wouldn't feel right.\n\nI'd like to think that I came up with an interesting concept. I'm not sure if it's been done before but I hope I pulled it off well enough, it seemed like it fit the theme pretty well.\n\nAlthough I was at a bit of a disadvantage because I didn't think of it until about 18 hours in. Originally I was going to do a game where you were a mage who had exceptionally quick mana recharging capabilities, but if you regenerated too much mana, your head would explode and you would die. which means you gotta be discharging arcane forces left and right to keep that from happening.\n\nAnyway if you're up for giving my game a try, don't be expecting a typical shooter, and just a heads up: plan your actions carefully. because if you don't, who knows? They might come back and bite you in the ass. :wink:\n\n![thumbnailanim.gif](///raw/67e/z/b675.gif)\n\nHere's What I used and how I made it:\n\n* language(s): HTML5 + Javascript ES6\n* IDE: Notepad ++\n* Image/Texture editing: Paint.NET\n* Debugging/Testing: Google Chrome\n\nAlso, it's got a sweet chip-tune track composed by Mark Sparling.\n\n## Instrucions:\n\n* move with arrow keys\n* jump with 'z'\n* shoot with 'x' or 'c'\n* The goal is to kill all the clones in the room to progress to the next round, sounds simple enough, right? You'll see..\n* If you get hit by a bullet, you lose health, displayed on the bar on the top of the screen. your health regenerates slowly, but be careful, just 4 consecutive hits and you're dead.\n* Make sure you pay attention to your time limit in the top left of the screen, if it runs out, you die.\n\n\nEnjoy!  \nAnd please leave honest feedback, I won't get offended I promise. \nAlso please post your high scores :D I wanna see if you can beat me at my own game.\n\ndeveloper links:   \n[twitter @TechnostalgicGM](https://twitter.com/TechnostalgicGM)  \n[technostalgic.itch.io](https://technostalgic.itch.io)  \n[my website(under construction)](http://technostalgic.tech/)  ","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//67e/z/b674.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/clones","author":{"name":"TechnoNugget","uid":3702,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/technonugget"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//67e/z/b675.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//67e/z/b675.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://technostalgic.itch.io/clones"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://v6p9d9t4.ssl.hwcdn.net/html/682694/index.html"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Lovely Kana","category":"jam","description":"Lovely Kana is a PC-9801 inspired visual novel revolving around the life of a humble, overworked office lady.\n\nManage your stress and laziness; your work life becomes harder the more you accumulate!

Wooohoooo!!!!\n\nI decided to use Unity because I've been wanting to learn it for a long time.  I spent the last month familiarizing myself with it and getting some initial things setup.  Boy I had no idea how much things change when you actually go to build a game with some of the tools you create.\n\nI've had the idea for Hymenoptera rolling around in my head for a long time and I figured Ludum Dare would be a great way to get started on it.  While I want to continue working on this past Ludum Dare, I think i've gotten off to a great start and i hope you all enjoy!\n\nI will admit i didn't get as far as i thought i would get, and I had to rush alot of UI and interactions bits because it took me much longer to get the system up and running the way i wanted.  So its not so much of a game as it has been a learning experience for me.\n\n# Gameplay\n\nYou are controlling an ant colony in an ant simulator, each ant has needs and can be told to collect certain resources.  The catch (to stick with the theme) is that the larger your ant colony grows the more unwieldy it becomes to manage and the resources costs for each, building, upgrade, technology costs a % more based on how many resources you have above the base cost.  There are a number of other hidden mechanics that also play into that same theme with regards to each ant needing to consume resources or collect them.\n\nThere are 4 resource types:\n* Sugar: The main source of ant food\n* Water: Everyone needs water too!\n* Protein: This helps you upgrade worker ants into soliders\n* Fungus: Mostly used for technology or mutation upgrades, but also used to create Alates (breeding ants)\n\nThe World map is made up of a series of colony, waypoint and resource nodes strung together in a path that ants will travel automatically to and from.\n\n","thumbnail_url":"","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/hymenoptera","author":{"name":"Rocktavious","uid":53841,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//152/d/z/9302.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/rocktavious"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://rocktavious.itch.io/ld40"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://rocktavious.itch.io/ld40/download/y_Z2Dv0sY1qA3TMn0MhzT3nbQmOQhUmqujSHwLcD"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Keyboard Kitten","category":"jam","description":"![gameplay_screenshot.PNG](///raw/8f5/6/z/d1ec.png)\n\nLink to game (Flash/Windows/Linux/Mac): https://cluedo.itch.io/keyboard-kitten\n\nKeyboard Kitten is a puzzle platformer game in which you control a cute kitten who wants to collect keys!

The estimated impact time - 7 days.\n\nKnowing this, Chad set himself one goal - not to die alone!\n\nHelp Chad accumulate as many lovers as possible within 7 days. But beware!

His goal is to always have at least one lover until the end of the world. The current number of lovers is shown at the top right of the screen, right next to the heart icon. You can see how many days are remaining until the apocalypse arrives next to the little calendar on top left of the screen.\n\nHe can be interrupted at any moment by a call from his lover who may ask Chad a question. If Chad messes up his answer, he will be dumped! If you remember the information that the lovers have revealed previously, you should be able to answer correctly most of the time.\n\nChad’s daily activities can also be interrupted by text messages from his lovers. They will reveal new information about his lovers that you should try to remember.\n\nWhen the day is over, he will go to the **Bar**. At the Bar, Chad can chose one person to go out with. That person will tell him his **name** and **preferences** in men. Keep this information in mind - it will be useful later!\n\nOnce Chad has selected, the day ends and he gets a new lover. Reach Day 0 with more than 0 lovers and you’re good to go! !\n\n## Screenshots\n---\n![2.png](///raw/5a1/01/z/b6b5.png)\n![5.png](///raw/5a1/01/z/b6bc.png)\n![3.png](///raw/5a1/01/z/b6bd.png)\n![7.png](///raw/5a1/01/z/b6e3.png)\n\n## Tools\n---\n+ Unity\n+ Character Creator v2.2","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//5a1/01/z/b6b4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/doomsday-lovers","author":{"name":"Simanis","uid":65957,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/simanis"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//5a1/01/z/b672.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//5a1/01/z/b672.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//5a1/01/z/b6b5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//5a1/01/z/b6b5.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//5a1/01/z/b6bc.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//5a1/01/z/b6bc.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//5a1/01/z/b6bd.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//5a1/01/z/b6bd.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//5a1/01/z/b6e3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//5a1/01/z/b6e3.png"}],"links":[],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Fish Catchers","category":"compo","description":"This is my game : fish catchers, you play as a fisherman who wants to catch fish, however the more fish you catch, the more sharks get attached.

Only things working are his absorption shield and weapons. As he soaks damage, his suit is overheating and overcharging, which increases his mobility and offensive capabilities, but also adds inconvenient random discharges and risk of being cooked inside. \n\n**Gameplay** is about balancing damage output and damage soak with trying to lose heat and excess energy.\n - Energy damage is fully converted into your battery, while small portion of kinetic damage always goes through.\n - Energy weapons(right-side) drain battery, but cause heating, while kinetic weapons(left-side) are more neutral and don't cause much effect on both (with exception of railgun - that thing will drain your battery fast).\n - Once your battery is 50% full, you start randomly discharging into nearby enemies - or yourself. Once it is overflowing, following discharge is much larger and much more painful.\n - Keep your eyes on your heat level - it's hard to lose it, and once it overflows damage goes directly into your health.\n - Try to survive as long as you can!\n\n**Controls**\n - WASD for movement, Space for jump\n - E for pickups\n - LMB/RMB to fire weapons (Kinetic/Energy)\n - Picked up weapons automatically replace weapon of same type.\n\n**Tips**\n - Electric weapons cause less heat but deal less damage than lasers. Useful to deal with overcharging, not so much for tough enemies.\n - Roller \"tires\" are armored, aim for the core for sweet crits.\n - You can make rollers and jumpers fall into the abyss - just be careful not to fall yourself.\n\n![screenshot4.jpg](///raw/15f/c/z/d0f4.jpg)\n![screenshot1.jpg](///raw/15f/c/z/cd7f.jpg)\n![screenshot2.jpg](///raw/15f/c/z/cd81.jpg)\n![screenshot3.jpg](///raw/15f/c/z/cd82.jpg)\n\n - Engine: **Unity 2017.2**\n - Graphics: **Gimp 2.8**\n - Assets used:\n - - (self-made) **ArcReactor Procedural Rays Generator** for laser effects\n - - **ProBuilder** for in-engine modeling and texturing\n\n**Production notes:** sadly, I didn't evaluate time correctly so many features were left on the design floor, alongside with audio. I was planning simple levelup system as player progresses through, more weapons and special abilities such as support fire and supplies drop from ship, and more random effects from increasing heat and charge. Also didn't get my hands on bfxr for fun with sounds. Well, I'm still quite proud of the result (not so much about code quality ;) - this thing vastly needs optimization).","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//15f/c/z/cf91.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/overcharged","author":{"name":"CatsPawsGames","uid":53073,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//15f/c/z/94c8.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/catspawsgames"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//15f/c/z/d0f4.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//15f/c/z/d0f4.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//15f/c/z/cd7f.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//15f/c/z/cd7f.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//15f/c/z/cd81.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//15f/c/z/cd81.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//15f/c/z/cd82.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//15f/c/z/cd82.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://catspawsgames.com/files/overcharged_win.zip"},{"label":"macOS","url":"http://catspawsgames.com/files/overcharged_mac.app.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://catspawsgames.com/files/overcharged_linux.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Clumsy Paws","category":"jam","description":"![logo 2.png](///raw/b84/f/z/a0c6.png)\n\n## There is a lot of cats in your room.\n\nThey are so adorable but so clumsy!

This is our first game jam participation, and our first game ever!\n\nOur interpetration of the theme is \"The more power you have, the worst game experience you'll get\". You control a character just before a boss fight. You have the opportunity to collect items that give you strength. But if you do so, you get too much power, and the game gets boring.\n\nAdditionally, we wanted to connect the topic to a moral dilemma: the items you collect are also the souls of your people. Meaning that getting more has also a bad impact on the story.\n\nOur all point is that our instinctive gamer behaviour (looting) does not necessarily lead to the best moral choices, or to the funniest game play.\n\nThe game is very simple to play, and very short, but we hope you'll enjoy your time!\n\nMade using Unity and Photoshop / Illustrator / After Effects !\n\n\n![itchio.gif](///raw/f48/c/z/c384.gif)\n![ldimg.jpg](///raw/f48/c/z/d5ae.jpg)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f48/c/z/c2e3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/aatmo","author":{"name":"Gaming Night","uid":51279,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f48/c/z/d6e6.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/gaming-night"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f48/c/z/c37e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f48/c/z/c37e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f48/c/z/c384.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f48/c/z/c384.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f48/c/z/d5ae.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f48/c/z/d5ae.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://gamingnight.itch.io/aatmo"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Re:Tileation","category":"jam","description":"Evil corporation has corrupted the lands.

You try to destroy the skeletons and yay! You leveled up! You choose one of the upgrades but feel no different. \"Oh well, it's probably just a battle ability,\" you think to yourself. Then some new skeletons come at you and... Oh no... You upgraded the enemies! How will you ever escape (oh, wait, you won't!)!\n\nThe theme was met through the way you upgrade the enemies instead of yourself when you level up. So, the more levels you have, the worse it is.\n\n![EVIL Christmas .gif](///raw/deb/a/z/a1b1.gif)\n\n## Instructions\n\nThe game is played thusly:\n\n![Instructions.gif](///raw/deb/a/z/a1b0.gif)\n\n## Prospects of the Game\n\nIt is definitely not done in any way and many later enemies are missing animations (but can still hit you!). The time simply did not allow for it.\n\nAt the same time, a win condition is not present, which might complicate winning...\n\nAnother element that was quite important but did not get in was the concept of traps. Those were meant to be for the opportunity to not get xp from kills but still getting the points. This would counteract the frustration of not being able to do anything about the enemies' power-ups.\n\n![Start game.gif](///raw/deb/a/z/a1b9.gif)\n\n## Resources\n\nThe game was made with these tools:\n- Game engine: Unity\n- Programming: Visual Studio Professional 2015\n- Graphics: Photoshop CC (animation done directly on sprite sheet (no onioning))\n- Audio: FL Studio for music, [bfxr](bfxr.com) for sfx\n\nNo external items were used except audio samples for the music production in FL Studio\n\n## Answers to comments:\n\n*Thanks for the feedback everybody! I know the game is pretty buggy and lackluster feel-wise. I had to just upload it early because of an important test I wanted to be ready for the next day (driver's license) - sorry for that!*\n\n#### Gameplay: \n\nThere's a lot of minor changes that I'll probably fix once the votings are done in the LD jam - so save it in your bookmarks and play it again later (I think it would be unfair to update it now as that would be outside the compo time).\n\nThe attack range being farther than the animation was intentional as that would limit player frustration regarding the vice versa concept (the hit box being shorter than the animation). But it was probably too far, anyway.\n\nThe stats for the currently implemented units are as follows:\n- Normal skeleton stats: 5 damage, 10 hp, 3 speed\n- Christmas skeleton: 10 damage\n- Boots skeleton: 6 speed\n- Helmet skeleton: 20 hp\n\nAnd the player:\n- Player stats: 5 damage, 40 hp, ~12 speed\n\nOther enemies are just the base skeleton with another skin - did not have the time to finish it.\n\n#### Menus:\nMenu navigation should have been more clear - it is not clear that the buttons can be clicked when gameplay does not include the mouse. This can probably be fixed by letting the user choose with the keyboard. The general travel time through the menus instead of instant respawn should probably be reevaluated as well.\n\nThanks to @[niborious](https://ldjam.com/users/niborious), @[Maroovan](https://ldjam.com/users/maroovan), @[the_BM](https://ldjam.com/users/the-bm), @[Remco](https://ldjam.com/users/remco), and @[MRUniverse](https://ldjam.com/users/mruniverse) for the valuable feedback :smile:","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//deb/a/z/be96.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/level-onslaught","author":{"name":"OrciFried","uid":44013,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/orcifried"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//deb/a/z/a1ab.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//deb/a/z/a1ab.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//deb/a/z/a1b1.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//deb/a/z/a1b1.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//deb/a/z/a1b0.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//deb/a/z/a1b0.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//deb/a/z/a1b9.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//deb/a/z/a1b9.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://itch.io/embed-upload/679048?color=333333"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"The Provocateur","category":"jam","description":"![TITLE.png](///raw/62c/z/d56e.png)\n\nYou are the provocateur who stands against the oppression of an evil government.

It's called *Kids, Don't Do Wild Magic*, inspired by the Wild Magic subclass of Sorcerer in D&D 5th edition.\n\n![SS1.jpg](///raw/054/3/z/b071.jpg)\n\nYou are locked in a duel with another mage in an arena, and your job is to be the last one standing. Use your spells to lower their health to zero while maintaining yours by dodging their attacks! The trick is that you follow the school of Wild Magic, and the more you cast the crazier (and usually worse!) things get. But that doesn't concern you - where would be the fun without the bewildering arcane aberrations?\n\n## Controls\n**W** - Move forward\n\n**S** - Move backward\n\n**A** - Strafe left\n\n**D** - Strafe right\n\nHold **Right Mouse Button** + **Mouse move** - Horizontal camera control\n\nHold **Shift** + **Space** - Enter casting. Disables movement.\n\n### While Casting\nHold **W** - Flamethrower\n\nHold **S** - Throw fireball\n\n#### Once More!\nHold Shift + Space + W for the flamethrower.\n\nHold Shift + Space + S for fireballs.\n\n![SS3.jpg](///raw/054/3/z/b076.jpg)\n\n## Wild Magic\nAs you cast more spells, your wild magic will go up. This will increase the range of your flamethrower and the explosion of you fireball, but can also come with side effects! Look for 11 unique effects to take place as you go about your battle.\n\n![SS2.jpg](///raw/054/3/z/b078.jpg)\n\n## Your Opponent\nYour opponent is crafty ice mage. Watch out for their ice lances and ice meteors. They also have the ability to teleport - listen for the distinctive sound this spell makes.\n\nIf you're having trouble, remember these tips for good fire magin'\n- Stay evasive. Don't let yourself get hit by those lances and slow moving meteors.\n- Get close. Your flamethrower can be devastating, if only you can get close enough.\n- Use their avoidance. Your enemy will try to avoid you if possible. Use this to your advantage by backing them into explosions.\n- Charge up. Your attacks become much more effective once you've charged up your wild magic. You'll know you've reached your full power when the sky goes dark!\n\n![SS4.jpg](///raw/054/3/z/b0b9.jpg)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//054/3/z/b06b.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/kids-dont-do-wild-magic","author":{"name":"ErikU","uid":13392,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/eriku"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//054/3/z/b071.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//054/3/z/b071.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//054/3/z/b076.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//054/3/z/b076.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//054/3/z/b078.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//054/3/z/b078.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//054/3/z/b0b9.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//054/3/z/b0b9.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yIfTkXqB9guvHf8h1xb37edmg2bUhu3G"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1x9eurktfTj6pKxnBlBYfGwD8VFkO4TWW"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RraL1IkO6F-LGm6M0IqJ-_Y0N3zQoSfR"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://gamebucket.io/game/222bf84e-4071-496f-b68d-62134cb82448"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"APOLLO v-1.0","category":"jam","description":"APOLLO v-1.0\n\nHi there!

I am not really sure how classify the genre. As a survivor of the recent apocalypse you seek to take back and settle the city of Kasprzak. You win the game if you can settle 30 a total of 30 survivors. You lose if everyone in your group dies.\n\nI haven't had much time to see if the game is balanced okay or not. This game may be quite difficult or quite easy. I'm hoping somewhere in the middle.\n\nWritten in C# MonoGame. \n\n## Issues/Changelog\n\n**NOTE POST-COMPO-CHANGE**: I did tweak things just a little bit so that ammo would drop more because it wasn't dropping enough to warrant needing 3 to upgrade a fighter. In retrospect you get enough food every time that the medical cards are basically useless :P Please rate keeping in mind the original build was a bit more difficult.\n\n**0 and 8 look too similar in the font** I shouldn't have included the dot in the middle.\n\n## Controls\n\nUse the Arrow Keys and Enter Button\n\n## Gameplay\n\nEvery turn as 2 to 3 phases.\n\n### Movement Phase\n\nIn phase 1 you move your group. The outskirts are rural, that moves to suburban and urban as you move to the center. Rural tiles are lower risk and take 3 survivors to settle. Urban tiles are the most risky but will settle 9 survivors. Once you settle a tile you may move through it freely. Otherwise every tile change triggers the next phase...\n\n### Action Phase\n\nIn this phase you face a situation. You can respond by fighting, looting and running, or just running. Each action has risk of consequences\n\n![Capture2.PNG](///raw/d01/z/b191.png)\n\n#### Fighting\n\nThis is the most risky action and always carries the chance of a death to the group. If you fight you will always receive the scouted resource cards. Fighting is the only way to make it to the 3rd phase.\n\n#### Looting & Running\n\nIn this action you will get at least 1 of the resource cards, at random. This carries the same risks as running, but carries with it an additional risk. \n\n#### Running\n\nIn this action there is risk, but no reward outcome. Usually, the risk will be less than fighting. **With both running, and looting and running,*** you will lose 1 wellness point and immediately go back to the Movement Phase.\n\n#### Resource Cards\n\nEvery Action Phase will have a number of scouted resource cards. These are the resources you'll get if you fight or may get if you loot & run. Resource cards are used to buy things in the Resting phase.\n\n#### Risks & Consequences\n\nEvery action has associated risks with known consequences. There are 3 consequences:\n\n* Death: Someone in your group will die\n* Injury: You will lose an additional wellness point\n* Damage: You will lose resource cards\n\n### Resting Phase\n\nIf you Fight you'll enter the Resting Phase. In this phase you can use the resource cards you have gathered. You can restore wellness points. You can upgrade one of your group to a fighter. Or you can settle the tile you are on.\n\n![Capture3.PNG](///raw/d01/z/b220.png)\n\n#### Wellness Points\n\nWellness points are a hunger clock of sorts. You need to keep your wellness points above 0. If you do not keep them above zero then members of your group will desert your group 1 per turn until your group is no more. use Food and Medical cards to increase these during the Resting Phase. Running diminishes your wellness points through attrition.\n\n##### Fighters\n\nTo settle a tile (see below) you will need a special class of survivor called a fighter. These are indicated by the use of green. To add additional fighters you need to collect a weapon card and 3 ammo cards.\n\n##### Settling A Tile\n\nSettling tiles requires you to have enough members of your group to settle the tile, including the required number of fighters, building materials, and food. The cost of settling is dependent on your map location. Rural has less cost, urban has more, suburban is in the middle. When you settle a tile, the members of your group leave.\n\nWhen you are done with the resting phase you may return to the Movement phase.\n\n### Game Ends When...\n\nThe game will end if you either complete the mission of settling 30 of your group, or if everyone dies or deserts the group.\n\n## A note on theme usage\n\nThe original design for this game called for other factions to attack your settlements (the more you have). Due to time constraints I opted instead for the size of your group to adjust difficulties. It will be more costly for you to run or loot and run when you have a large group. However, it becomes less risky to fight. I wish I had more time to incorporate the theme better.\n\n# THANK YOU FOR PLAYING!\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d01/z/aec6.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/apokalipsa","author":{"name":"srakowski","uid":269,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d01/z/4ccb.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/srakowski"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d01/z/aede.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d01/z/aede.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d01/z/b191.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d01/z/b191.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d01/z/b220.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d01/z/b220.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/srakowski/LD40/releases/download/LD40/Apokalipsa.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Super childcare assistant","category":"compo","description":"![cap.png](///raw/2e0/3/z/a95b.png)\n\nGame about babies, too many and the obligation to take care of them.\n\nCompetition between childcare assistants.\n\nWin points by giving them comforter, nappy and bottle.\n\nEach time you get points you get a dirty nappy that you can drop.\n\nWalking on the dirty nappy stun you for 2 sec.\n\nGame go for 60 sec.\n\nOnline game available, server currently in france.

The land is corrupted and the corruption has destroyed everything. You are trapped in a field with corruption all around. From the corruption ghouls emerge and attack you. Even if you can fend off the ghouls, the corruption is toxic and will harm you if you get too close. \n\n# Mechanics\n\nGhouls emerge from the corrupted tiles. The more tiles you have, the more ghouls will come out--making the game significantly harder.\n\nThere are temporary upgrades for the mage's abilities. As well as hearts to replenish his health.\n\nExploding a bomb with 'space' will remove the corrupted tiles, helping you manage the number of ghouls that spawn.\n\n# Feelings\n\nI wish I had been able to add more content to this, like other types of enemies. However, the game I made on Saturday was pretty horrible, so I pivoted and made this game instead. As such, I only had Sunday for working on it. I'm still pretty happy with the result. At least it looks better than most of my games and I learned a lot from both the failed attempt on Saturday and the successful attempt on Sunday.\n\n# Plans\n\nI don't know how much I will work on this after the jam. I'll probably fix things that people notice and add a little more content.\n\nI had some ideas for other types of mages--like one that grows foliage to push back the corruption.

If you're looking for a challenge, you might want to try this.\n\nLook for the \"hard_maps\" folder in the Data/Maps/ folder. Inside the hard folder, there are different variants of the levels. Just replace the contents of the Data/Maps/ folder with the contents of the \"hard_maps\" folder.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e7/z/ae5b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/the-crushed-sky","author":{"name":"CMLSC","uid":126,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e7/z/4da1.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/cmlsc"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e7/z/b813.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e7/z/b813.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e7/z/ae19.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e7/z/ae19.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e7/z/ae3b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e7/z/ae3b.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://cmlsc.itch.io/the-crushed-sky"},{"label":"web","url":"https://twitter.com/DaFluffyPotato"},{"label":"web","url":""}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"A Week of Chicken","category":"compo","description":"![Thumbnail.png](///raw/0fd/6/z/b396.png)\n\nYou're a chicken farmer, but you've lost your 21 chickens.

There's really no goal, other than to see how long you can last.\n\nHow it works: The game starts off with the Player and an Enemy. Each character will have 30 seconds to live. To gain more life, you have to steal it by shooting other Enemies. As the game progresses, more enemies will appear, and time will start taking its toll on the Player as well.\n\nThe instructions are simple: Use WASD to move, and the left-mouse button to shoot.\n\nTo Download: Just click on the link to my GitHub. Once downloaded, the Executable file should be in the Executables folder. The game should work with any PC...\n\nUnfortunately, I can't work on it any further at the moment, but, with what I was able to accomplish, I'm pretty proud of myself. Maybe I'll consider upgrading this game in the future. I hope you enjoy it, I'd love to hear any critiques you've got, and I'm happy that LDJam 40 is my first game jam ever!\n\nNOTES:\n1) The graphics I used were both self-made, and a few sprites from Unity's Standard 2D Pack, although a lot of it remains unused.\n2) There is no audio, as I didn't pace myself to add any.\n3) The tools I used for this game are:\n- Unity (C#)\n- Piskel (sprites)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//163/c/z/b1e2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/my-first-game-killing-for-time","author":{"name":"Cratonic","uid":50017,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/cratonic"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/fttang14/LDJam_40_Killing_For_Time"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Space Suckers","category":"jam","description":"**SPACE SUCKERS**\n\nYou've been left on an alien planet and you must fight through five intense levels.

Deal with the crises the dig has unearthed, recover artifacts from the city, and survive the 10 days for rescue to arrive. But be careful, each relic you obtain will drive you closer to insanity, making it harder and harder to fight off the terrors of below!\n\nAdditional Instructions:\n\nAt the end of the game, you need to have more money from relics than was lost on base repairs and the deaths of members of the expedition. Each crisis that isn't resolved adds $100 to your costs, and each death adds $100. Each relic gives you $100 in profit, or an additional $200 if you research it in the Dome.\n\nTo move, click on a character's card, and then click on a room in the base. Each room has a special ability, as does each character that may take specific dice and/or resources. Of particular focus is the digsite: this is where you acquire your relics, and the dome, where you learn what they do.\n\nYou can click and drag dice once you roll them using the button. Dice in the Dice Hold are not rerolled if you click the roll button again, and you can drag the dice to any of the glowing squares to use them there. Crises in rooms need a total value of dice added, and each die reduces it, while other abilities may require specific die values, or dice with a certain value, denoted with an arrow pointing up.\n\nTools used: Unity 2017.2, Visual Studio, Photoshop, Inkscape","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9a3/1/z/a552.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/the-shadow-from-below","author":{"name":"Arkthalohs","uid":5033,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/arkthalohs"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9a3/1/z/a55c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9a3/1/z/a55c.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://arkthalohs.itch.io/the-shadow-from-below"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/xfb2jk7z3i7yku5/ShadowFromBelowWindows.zip?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Gang Gang","category":"jam","description":"A world of gangs....

You can even fail the trial because of love!\n\n# Game Goal:\n- Harvest as many souls as possible.\n- Earn as much score as possible.\n- Don't let your love and mercy hold your back!\n\n# Control: \n - Use **\"W\", \"A\", \"S\", \"D\"** to move around.\n - Use **\"Left mouse button\"** to harvest souls.\n\nor\n - Use **\"↑\", \"←\", \"↓\", \"→\"** to move around.\n - Use **\"Left ctrl\"** to harvest souls.\n\n# Used tools: \n\n### Game Engine\n- Unity \n\n### Version Control \n- Git Kraken\n- SourceTree \n\n### Chart\n- Coggle \n- Draw.io \n\nMost of the resources of models (modular assets) come from the online resource, but I use them to design the level in the game.\nMost of the resources of audio come from the online resources. \n\nDesigned and made by **Cliff Lee CL**.\n\n# Previous Ludum Dare Game List:\n- [LD40: Trial of the Reaper](https://tommyboys0107.itch.io/trial-of-the-reaper)\n- [LD38: Virus Riot](https://tommyboys0107.itch.io/virus-riot)\n- [LD37: Election War](https://tommyboys0107.itch.io/election-war)\n- [LD36: The Last Blacksmith](https://tommyboys0107.itch.io/the-last-blacksmith)\n- [LD35: Medusa Massacre](https://tommyboys0107.itch.io/medusa-massacre)\n- [LD34: You can't see but you can feel](https://tommyboys0107.itch.io/you-cant-see-but-you-can-feel)\n- [LD33: Ninja Cockroach](https://tommyboys0107.itch.io/ninja-cockroach)\n- [LD32: Coder VS Bugs](https://tommyboys0107.itch.io/coder-vs-bugs)\n- [LD31: Screen Pong](https://tommyboys0107.itch.io/screen-pong)\n- [LD30: Parallel Worlds](https://tommyboys0107.itch.io/parallel-worlds)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//73b/z/d352.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/trial-of-the-reapor","author":{"name":"Cliff Lee CL","uid":2871,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//73b/z/96c2.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/cliff-lee-cl"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//73b/z/d359.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//73b/z/d359.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//73b/z/d35a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//73b/z/d35a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//73b/z/d35b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//73b/z/d35b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//73b/z/d35d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//73b/z/d35d.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//73b/z/d35c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//73b/z/d35c.png"}],"links":[{"label":"web","url":"https://tommyboys0107.itch.io/trial-of-the-reaper"},{"label":"web","url":"https://gamejolt.com/games/TrialOfTheReaper/301695"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JIhDYsWLXI_NYmMH0owO1haaWTV0kYKi"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1U7FWFxHCachFhRITsiysObik3sx8g9bv"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1V9R9O2C9WLYaT0750_doMQx7OKkyI7zG"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","linux","mac"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Sticky Fingers","category":"compo","description":"You play the role of a common burglar, collect as much delightful loot as you can.\nDid I forget to to mention that the more you pickup the slower you go?

The idea this time is that if you have too many upgrades, you will have a more difficult time to complete the game. But you also want to have as many upgrades as possible for the SWAG.\n![gameplay.png](///raw/c5d/8/z/a89e.png)\n\n## SWAG\n\nBy upgrading your robot you will get more SWAG. With alot of SWAG you will make success at the ROBO-Assemblage, largest EXPO for robots!\n\n##### Controls\n\n- Movement: WASD, Arrowkeys, Q+E\n- Menu: ESC\n- Shoot: Space\n\n##### Gameplay\n\nCollect powerups to make your robot more Lavish and Impressive. Be aware that the heat level will rise when the load increases on your old power core.\n\n![heat.png](///raw/c5d/8/z/a7a6.png)\n\nGet to the ROBO-Assemblage before you overheat or worse!\n\n#### Features\n- Menus! (didn't have that last LD!)\n- Levels!

Now body gets replaced by overall SWAG)\n\n\n##### Background\n\nYou play a rusty old robot that has lost all SWAG. Everything changes when you find a ticket to the expo ROBO-Assemblage! Make your way there as early as possible, but maybe take the opportunity to get some upgrades on the way?\n\nBeware: Your power core can't be upgraded, so each upgrade will take its toll on the HEAT-meter.

If you're not worried about spoilers, this is the best strategy to use:\n\n1. Avoid mushrooms and frogs entirely until you have your first ability, Fireball. They deal the most damage. If you have to take them out (such as from being in a room with just them) make sure you're only taking on one at a time.\n2. Only take out frogs and mushrooms from a distance with the Fireball.

You need to stop this and catch him. But try not upset the people too much. Remember: The tighter you squeeze, the more they will slip through your fingers. The more troops you raise and more tax you raise to support securing your power, the worse your rebel problem will become.\n\n## Gameplay instructions\n\n1. Send spies to villages to track down rebel/hero activity. To do so, click the village on the map and adjust the target spies.\n2. After a short while you will get a status report. If you find the hero, send soldiers to kill him. It will take 5 soldiers to subdue him.\n3. To recruit more soldiers/spies, go to your castle and click the button. Soldiers cost 20 gold, and spies cost 40 gold.\n4. If you run out of gold, you can tax the people to get more gold. Be warned, that upsets the taxed village (a lot!) and also raises the global unrest slightly.\n\n## Tips\n\n* Tax rate is 0.3g per villager.

Like Uno, you can play a card each turn that matches the numeric value or color of the last played card, with the goal to discard all your cards. Action cards, such as reverse (turn order), skip, wild (allows for any card to be played), and +2/+3/+4 also exist.\n\nYksi introduces skirmishes, a new combo system that allows a player to play another +2/+3/+4 card when the last player already played one - combining the cards and sending it to the next player! Trust us, you don't want to get hit by a +10. You can also play a reverse during a skirmish to send the cards back at another player, or play a skip card to negotiate peace.\n\n### Platforms and Controls\n\nYou can play on any modern web browser across desktop and mobile!\n\nDrag bubble cards to the top bar to play.\n\nTap top bar to draw cards\n\n### Credits\n\n** Ian Jones **\n\nClient Programming | Server Programming | Game Design | UI & UX\n\n([Twitter](https://twitter.com/witsdev)) ([Github](https://github.com/wits))\n\n** Bret Hudson **\n\nServer Programming | Game Design | Rude Comments\n\n([Twitter](twitter.com/brethudson)) ([Github](github.com/brethudson))\n\n*- Special Thanks to [Joonas Turner](https://twitter.com/KissaKolme/status/937760365244542976) for the Yksi title tune!

My first Ludum Dare Game. Mixed feelings.\n\n## About the game\nYou play as a (stylish) shepherd who tries to get his sheep to the endzone of the levels. For each level you get a score depending on your time and the number of sheep brought to the endzone.\n\nBringing back sheep to the endzone causes them to spawn on the next level. So in each stage there will be more and more sheep making it harder to get them to the endzone.\n\nYou can stack up to 6 sheep. But each sheep makes you heavier making jumps (or movement) nearly impossible.\n\nCall sheep to let them go to your position. If you're to far ahead, they won't follow you. \n\nIf you're falling down a gap, you'll respawn at the start of the level. You only lose some time. However if one sheep falls down it is lost. It gets only back if you reset the complete level.\n\nMy total score was **73.170 points**. _Can you beat it?_\n\n## Controls\n|        Key | Action        |\n|-----------:|---------------|\n| Arrow Keys | Walking       |\n|          X | Jump          |\n|     Hold C | Pick Up Sheep |\n|  Release C | Throw Sheep   |\n|          V | Call Sheep    |\n|          R | Reset Level   |\n\n## Known Bugs\nIt might happen that sheep will stuck on the ceiling\n\nIf somethings like that happen, simply **press R to reset the level**. Sorry for any inconveniences.\n\n## Requirements\nThe game was made in Java with the LibGDX framework.\n**You will need the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.6 or later to play this game.** \nYou can download it from the [official java website](https://java.com/de/download/).\n\n## Things that went wrong\n1. Time management was harsh. I did not provide any code templates for LibGDX (except rudimental collision detection), so I had to implement everything from skratch\n\n2. Graphics took way to long. Next time I have to develop a more simplisitc style for easier and faster drawing progress\n\n3. If I had had more time, I would have included audio. Sadly no baa sound... no chilly music...\n\n## Screenshots\n![screenshot_2.png](///raw/276/e/z/c7b4.png)\n\n![screenshot_3.png](///raw/276/e/z/c7b6.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//276/e/z/c7a6.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/get-your-sheep-together","author":{"name":"Bros.","uid":58994,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/bros"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//276/e/z/c7b4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//276/e/z/c7b4.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//276/e/z/c7b6.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//276/e/z/c7b6.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/BrosLD/LD40/files/1529274/get_your_sheep_together.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Kitten Keeper","category":"jam","description":"![Kitten Keeper](///raw/149/3/z/d6b1.jpg)\n\n# Kitten Keeper\n\nKittens are so cute ! You cannot have to many of them. Or can you ?\n\nYou have to take care of kittens. Give them food, a place to sleep, etc. and soon you will have plenty of them. What could possibly go wrong ?\n\n*Important notice:* As usual, Windows binaries won't be available right now. I will try to build it ASAP.\n\n## Instructions\n\nBuy items by clicking on the buttons at the bottom left and place them on the ground. Cats will use them... If they are in the mood. Look at the bubbles to know what they need. Be careful though, you don't have infinite money.\n\nWhen kittens are happy, more will come (with money!). Try to keep the happiness at 100%. Avoid deaths. If cats are missing something, happiness will drop and you might loose. Note that only a limited number of cats can use the same item at once, so be sure to place plenty of them.\n\nAdvice: don't think too much about it.

The more stone you have in the end, the worse your pay will be at the end of the timed period. You have 1 minute to dig as much as you can, the dirt and grass blocks do not hurt or help your score. You only can mine blocks within a 3 or 4 block radius around you. I hope you enjoy playing it, and give some feedback! The controls are the basic WSAD, and to mine you click with the mouse. To use your jetpack you just hold spacebar. Have fun, and I look forward to see what you have to say! :)\n\nHave a nice day, and thanks for stopping by!\n\n\nPictures: \n\n![MainTitleSCreen1.PNG](///raw/99a/d/z/b484.png)\n![pic1.PNG](///raw/99a/d/z/b480.png)\n![jetpack1.PNG](///raw/99a/d/z/b481.png)\n![pic3.PNG](///raw/99a/d/z/b482.png)\n![pic4.PNG](///raw/99a/d/z/b483.png)\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//99a/d/z/b48b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/money-making-miner","author":{"name":"beanslasher","uid":55961,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/beanslasher"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//99a/d/z/b484.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//99a/d/z/b484.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//99a/d/z/b480.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//99a/d/z/b480.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//99a/d/z/b481.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//99a/d/z/b481.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//99a/d/z/b482.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//99a/d/z/b482.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//99a/d/z/b483.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//99a/d/z/b483.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://longbrotherstudios.itch.io/money-making-miner"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Snowy Pinball","category":"jam","description":"An early prototype of a pinball game where snow gets in the way of the player.\n\nYou need to install LÖVE / love2D to use it with linux or macos.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b56/c/z/9f3c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/snowy-pinball","author":{"name":"chu","uid":50779,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b56/c/z/925f.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/chu"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://chuw.itch.io/snowy-pinball"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://chuw.itch.io/snowy-pinball"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://chuw.itch.io/snowy-pinball"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://chuw.itch.io/snowy-pinball"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux","mac"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Slagathor at the Dentist","category":"jam","description":"Controls:\n\n    No\n\nWarning: \n\n    You must be a dentist to play this game or you will not maximise your fun!\n\n\nWant to make games just like this?

For each car you can take customers onboard, drop them off and/or move the car.\nYou can do so in any order you wish and you can even drop or take multiple customers at the same time but you can only use each action once (ie : you **can** drop one customer, move the car and take two onboard but you **cannot** take one, move the car, drop him and take another one). Taking customers onboard or dropping them off can be done from either side of the street.\n\nAt the end of your turn you must spawn a commuter following the rules defined in the * Spawning Commuters * section. You also have to give back 1$ per car you own to the bank.\n\n### Taking Commuters onboard\n\nWhen you take a commuter onboard, he pays upfront. The price for the ride is twice the number of blocks between where he is and his destination.\n\n### Dropping off commuters\n\nWhen you drop a client, you do not gain any money ( he already payed upfront ). However you can add one to the number of passengers you took care off ( a piece of paper can do the trick for the book keeping). If he was you seventh passenger then you win and the game ends. If not, you spawn another commuter following the rules in the * Commuters Spawning * section.\n\n### Movement\n\nA car can move to each one of the six adjacent streets if no other car is present on it.\n\n### Cars\n\nAt any time during your turn you can buy a car for 10 $. You place it on your Taxi HQ ( if none is already present ) and will be unable to move it until the next turn.\n\nAt the end of each of your turn you loose 1$ per car your own ( exccept the one you just bought ).\n\nCars can each fit up to **two passengers**.\n\n### Commuters Spawning\n\nEach time you need to spawn a commuter, you first have to roll the dice. The result will decide if a commuter really spawns or not.\nIf you spawn a commuter because you just dropped one off, 1,2 or 3 will make a new one appear.\nIf you spanw the commuter at the end of your turn 1 or 2 will make a new one appear.\n\nIf a commuter has to spawn, randomly draw a spawn card and a commuter token and place the commuter token according to the spawn card.\n\nPut back the spawn card in the deck and shuffle it.\n\n### End Conditions\n\nThe first player to successfully drop off 7 commuters or to buy 4 cars wins.\n\nIf during its turn a player cannot move any of his cars or ends his turn with 0$, he loses.\n\nIf more than 10 commuters are present on the board ( those in the players cars do not count ) for more than one turn, everybody loses.\n\n## Additional information\n\nThe game can surely be played with 3 or more players but you'll have to adapt the rules yourself for now. We do plan to make a more flexible version of the game but it will be after the Ludum Dare.\n\n## Credits\n\n** Carnage ** was made monday evening in ~4/5h by yours truly :\n**KerDelos** ( Game Design & Rules ) and\n**Tyrannas** ( Game Design & Illustrations )\n\n\n\nWe hope you'll forgive us if this version is a bit rough, we'll try to make a more polished post jam version of the game.

I were about to write a blogpost here on [ldjam.com](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/$50564/nearly-dropped-out-now-im-back-in) with the title *\"I'm out!\"*.\n\nRight when I were about to do that some buddies joined the discord server I was on and asked how I was doing. We quickly came the the conclusion that my situation wasn't that good. Within a few minutes they had come up with multiple great ideas. Now the only question was if I had enough time, with only 28 hours left I was in a real rush!\n\nBut I now proudly present  **_\"dang homeless people!\"_**\n\n### Quick guide\nIn *dang homeless people!* you run around on the streets collecting your coins you dropped. However when the homeless sees you, a rich guy collecting mere pennies they get angry, and attack you!\n\nThe more money you collect the more homeless will get mad and attack you!\n\nSee how long you can survive without getting mugged and becoming homeless yourself!\n\n![Icon512x512.png](///raw/2c5/1/z/ac72.png)\n\n### Challenges\nI have made these challenges to you, these aren't implemented into the game, but have a go at them anyway!\n\n#### Easy\n- Get a total of 50 coins in one go.\n\n#### Medium\n- Get a total of 75 coins in one go.\n\n#### Hard\n- Get a total of 100 coins a single game!\n\nI have only made it to **Medium** so good luck!\n\n\nWhen you die you can see your highscore, why not post it down in the comments with your feedback?\n\n![highscore.PNG](///raw/2c5/1/z/aae7.png)\n\n### Controls\nWASD - move the player around.\n\nSPACE - use you sprint ability.\n\nMOUSE - use menus.\n\n### Known bugs\n- **Bug-code 1:** When you take damage you will be able to run out of the borders, but when the immunity to damage stops, you will be teleported back into the scene.\n\n\n- **Bug-code 2:** Due to time limitation I didn't have time to make the borders scale with the screen size so they are made to 16:9 resolution. I have made 16:9 resultions the only playable resolution based on that.\n\n\n- **Bug-code 3:** On the Mac I tested on, the horizontal borders are just outside the screen size(1440p x 900p). This is outside of 16:9 res, so if the 16:9 requirement isn't fulfilled on Mac this a bug, please come as close to 16:9.\n\n### Tested status\n- **Windows x84** tested and working on Windows 10 x64, 16gb ram & Windows 10 x64, 32gb ram.

The tires are a little used, so expect some slipping here and there. Also, the bus allows for only 100 passengers, but we don't follow those rules here. It does become harder to drive when it's overweight though... Good luck, and please don't destroy the bus.\n\n### Controls\n\n+ 'W' - Acceleration\n+ 'A', 'D' - Steering\n+ SPACE - Brake\n+ 'S' - Reverse\n\n### How To Play\n\nYou have to pick up the passengers at every bus stop and take them \"safely\" to the central station.\n\n+ Move in the street, avoiding other cars and buildings.\n+ Stop at the pickup zones of the stations. These are marked with blue lines. Use the brake (SPACE) to completely stop touching the zone.\n![Po.PNG](///raw/a70/8/z/caf1.png)\n+ When all passengers aboard, continue to the next station until you reach the central station.\n![End.PNG](///raw/a70/8/z/cb1b.png)\n+ Beware of your health and overweigth level in your car control panel. The more passengers you have, the less stable your bus is.\n![UI.PNG](///raw/a70/8/z/cb2c.png)\n\n### What about that sweet funky music?\n\nI'm very passionate about music. Although this is only my second Ludum Dare, you could say it's already a tradition that I spend almost half of the time composing, arranging and recording a special song for the game. This time it's a weird funk song that adds instruments when your bus gets more and more crowded. It ends up fitting really nicely. I encourage you to try to hear the whole song in it's 4 stages without dying in the game. It's not easy.\n\nThanks to my dad for recording the brass section of the song. He did an amazing job with it.\n\n### What about everything else?\n\nThe graphics are all done using nothing but the basic Unity's 3D shapes. Hence the cubic-look of the place.\nSome modified sound effects, some custom car physics written using C# and ... That's pretty much it.\n\n#### Known Issues\n+ The lightning is all messed up.

I wanted to make a tribute to the main 40 Ludum Dare themes, that have to be rememberer and seen as voxel models. The player has to remember the item shown on the door of the current room and throw it into the box. As you proceed you have to remember the previous item while seeing the current one in the new room. The game was planned to have particles effects that divert you while making progress in the game. I also imagined it to start randomly when you restart the game. As for the theme itself, you can imagine it as the more items you have to remember, the worse it gets as you'll have a hard time memorizing all items.\n\n\n**Current status:**\n\nThe jam version contains the basic game mechanics like Jump'n'Run controls, grabbing and throwing objects and opening doors. All 40 rooms are available but not fully functional in terms of exploration.\n\nI edited the objects to be all positive so you don't have to remember the items, as this is something that has to be edited finally.\n\n**Credits:**\nMusic by: \"Pixelland\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0b2/z/cb76.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/remembag","author":{"name":"Satyre","uid":688,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/satyre"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/y5w0kcl2msy7gtz/Remembag_Winx86.zip?dl=0"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/9wscho5z1rpb2e4/Remembag_Winx64.zip?dl=0"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/bvsn7t22ophnpvv/Remembag_MacUniversal.app.zip?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Robot Runaway","category":"jam","description":"An unfinished game.\n\nControls:\nW,A,S,D","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//571/c/z/bdd7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/robot-runaway","author":{"name":"Benjamin Bos","uid":49525,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//571/c/z/909e.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/benjamin-bos"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://benjamin-bos.itch.io/robot-runaway"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Don't bug me!","category":"jam","description":"![title.png](///content/b19/6/z/c8dc.png)\n\n![ss](///content/b19/6/z/c910.png)\n\n## Description\n\nI did it! \n\nI got seeds of millionaire!\nMy bro said me only I should do is clickin'.\nMake it rain!\n\n\n\n邪魔するな！\n\nやったぜ！億万長者の種を手に入れた！\n俺のダチはただクリックすれば良いって言ってたな．\n金の雨降らせてやるぜ！\n\n## Controls\n\n- Move: wasd & cursor keys\n- Plant Seed: Left Click \n- Crop: Right Click\n- Zoom: Middle Click\n\n## Staff\n\n###  Programing\n\n- tanitta (trit_techne) [Link](http://tanitta.net/)\n- ray45422 [Link](https://twitter.com/ray45422)\n- hoshi umeko\n\n### Design & Modeling\n\n- Zaslon [Link](http://starlightensign.com/)\n\n### Sound\n\n- OtObOx [Link](https://soundcloud.com/user7999881/)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b19/6/z/c910.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/dont-bug-me","author":{"name":"trit_techne","uid":26907,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/trit-techne"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b19/6/z/c8dc.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b19/6/z/c8dc.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b19/6/z/c910.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b19/6/z/c910.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/ld40-team-unagi/main-game/releases/tag/v1.0.0"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://github.com/ld40-team-unagi/main-game/releases/tag/v1.0.0"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://github.com/ld40-team-unagi/main-game/releases/tag/v1.0.0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Drill Run","category":"jam","description":"Drill Run is a simple game where you take control of a drill.\n\nYour mission is to mine as many of the gems as you can, but this is not as easy as it might seem.\n\n-Mining gems uses up a small amount of power, so make sure not to mine them too fast.\n-Mining large rocks uses up a large amount of power and makes you lose gems, so watch out for them!\n-Be wary of your power level.

In the interval of one to two minutes one of you will become a werewolf and will try to kill you all. You can save yourslf by throwing all the artifacts of certain type into the witch's cauldron.\n\nThis is multiplayer game! You can create a server and wander alone, but the game is designed for 4-5 people.\nWe did not have time to integrate a voice chat into the game, but gameplay involves communication between players, so we suggest you to use any kind of voice to communicate during the match.\n\nThe goal of the werewolf is to kill all explorers.\nThe goal of the explorers is to figure out type of artifacts they need to thrown into the witch's cauldron in the main hall, and then throw them all there. (unsuitable artifacts do will not go into the cauldron)\n\nThe werewolf can not enter the hall in a wolf form, but can do this as a human. No one can kill a werewolf, and he can turn back and forth to deceive explorers by pretending to be one of them.\n\nYou can only carry one item (a flashlight or an artifact) so you will need to cooperate. Explorers can open and close doors, and a werewolf can only smash them with three strikes.\n\nControls:\n\nWASD – move\nE – interact with objects\nF - pickup or drop objects\nLMB - use object in hand\nShift – run\nCtrl – sit down (run really fast in a wolf form).\n\nT – transforms you into a werewolf\n![Screenshot_32.png](///raw/432/e/z/cf1d.png)![Screenshot_33.png](///raw/432/e/z/cf23.png)![Screenshot_34.png](///raw/432/e/z/cf28.png)![Screenshot_39.png](///raw/432/e/z/cf2b.png)![Screenshot_35.png](///raw/432/e/z/cf2f.png)![Screenshot_36.png](///raw/432/e/z/cf34.png)![Screenshot_37.png](///raw/432/e/z/cf3b.png)![Screenshot_38.png](///raw/432/e/z/cf3d.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//432/e/z/cf7e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/betrayal-at-mansion","author":{"name":"Hologryph","uid":57908,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//432/e/z/98af.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/hologryph"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//432/e/z/cf1d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//432/e/z/cf1d.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//432/e/z/cf23.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//432/e/z/cf23.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//432/e/z/cf28.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//432/e/z/cf28.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//432/e/z/cf2b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//432/e/z/cf2b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//432/e/z/cf2f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//432/e/z/cf2f.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//432/e/z/cf34.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//432/e/z/cf34.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//432/e/z/cf3b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//432/e/z/cf3b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//432/e/z/cf3d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//432/e/z/cf3d.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rDoJvASUlzNckdvV2-li7nhgclDsE9mk"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Ship It","category":"jam","description":"You are an angry drone pilot delivering packages to a bunch of jerks.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//704/c/z/aa1a.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/ship-it","author":{"name":"ngeopetes","uid":50183,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/ngeopetes"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://extracheddar.itch.io/shipit"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"findMyself","category":"jam","description":"![start.png](///raw/ccf/e/z/ba72.png)\nWhen you have one arrow, you may know where you should go.

Just move near the treasure to add it to your stash.\n\n**Controls**\n- wasd for movement \n- spacebar or left mouse button to fire\n\nYou can hold down the fire button to continually fire shots.\n\n**Enemies**\n- Fishing boat. This enemy is neutral and doesn't attack unless provoked. In fact, he doesn't want much trouble and so will ignore the first shot fired at him.\n- Merchant ship. This enemy is neutral but has no issue attacking when provoked and is well armed.\n- Royal ship. Very aggressive and will aggro onto you should one get too close.

Post jam to follow.\n* Linux build out, Windows and macOS in the works. Stay tuned.\n\n## About\n\nYou're an endangered species shelter manager. New animals are showing up at your shelter much faster than you'd really like.\n\nYou need to push them out of gates as fast as possible to make space for new animals to be delivered and put them into right habitat to flourish. (Habitats implemented, but not effects on animals.)\n\nYou also want them to reproduce, so putting the same species together is high priority. (Scoring not implemented.)\n\n## How To Play\n\nThe game is played on keyboard. Arrows to move around, spacebar is select, return is skip phase/cancel.\n\nEach turn has three phases.\n\n1. In first, you can move one animal by one space.\n2. In second, you can remodel one space into another habitat.\n3. In third upkeeping is done, animals delivered, shelter extended, …\n\n**Good luck!**\n\n## Tech used\n\nGame is written in C++17 with use of [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/README.md)\n\n### Building\n\nTo build your own, you'll need a compiler that supports `optional`, `string_view`, `filesystem`, and some general C++17 stuff. Quickfix to circumvent `filesystem` not supported on MinGW is present. You'll also need the two libs mentioned.\n\nAfter building the game, uncompress the assets archive into the same directory the binary is present.\n\n### Running\n\nTo run the Linux build, you need SFML installed from your repos.\n\n## Trivia\n\nWe managed to fit several cross themes in, including [One Game a Month](http://www.onegameamonth.com/) Month 60 theme - \"Jam\", [Weekly Game Jam](http://www.weeklygamejam.com/) Week 21 theme - \"Save a Life\", and 2nd [Kajam](https://alakajam.com/) theme - \"Sound Effects\".","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//566/8/z/cf90.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/animal-jam","author":{"name":"Eremiell","uid":34405,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/eremiell"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//566/8/z/cf90.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//566/8/z/cf90.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"Linux","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IqCH6e9Dz4c1qPh3DUvA1vnlXAjTQohZ"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["linux","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Tendril","category":"compo","description":"A strategy game of managing growing tendrils.\n\n![1.png](///raw/cb7/3/z/ae16.png)\n![2.png](///raw/cb7/3/z/ae1a.png)\n![3.png](///raw/cb7/3/z/ae1e.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cb7/3/z/ad8b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/tendril","author":{"name":"NykolaR","uid":14268,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/nykolar"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cb7/3/z/ae16.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cb7/3/z/ae16.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cb7/3/z/ae1a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cb7/3/z/ae1a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cb7/3/z/ae1e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cb7/3/z/ae1e.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://nykolar.itch.io/tendril"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Pac Attack","category":"compo","description":"A simple clone of Pacman.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//19e/7/z/ad07.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/pac-attack","author":{"name":"tjxx","uid":32401,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/tjxx"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://tjxx.github.io/LudumDare40/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Stop Eating Burgers!","category":"jam","description":"Prevent a sick person to eat burgers by destroying all enemies in his body!\nMy first Jam alone.

NOTE: This is more of a joke experience with an intro sequence than it is a game. Don't try to get a high score.\n\nIt's my first game jam game, and was built mainly to practice C# coding and utilization of my paid and free Unity assets.  90% of time on visuals, sound, and intro sequence. 10% of time on gameplay. Lesson learned! More lessons learned: Coroutines can become confusing; Unity's Animation panel is pretty terrible; Sirenix Odin is well worth the money; sometimes you just have to restart the computer; a laptop without a graphics card is not great for 3D game development (duh-- it can't even run Crysis); exposing UnityEvents in the Inspector is pretty neat; sleep is NOT overrated; and more.\n\nATTRIBUTIONS: Sound effects obtained from soundfx.co.uk and zapsplat.com; some Creative Commons Zero.\n\nThere's not a whole lot of original code here-- nor gameplay; it's pretty much just a mashup of paid and free Unity Asset Store assets, but the code that I have the right to share will be up on GitHub (it's horrendous, don't use it). Using the source code as a project may not work very well (or at all) unless you install several of the assets I used.

(It was too hard up to the point where progress was impossible - went with the theme of GameJam too hard :D )\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: What is the point of the game? A: The idea is simple. You are a half-naked pixelated female character out in the space, fighting space ships by reflecting the projectiles they fire at you.\n\nQ: How does she breathe? A: It is a female that managed to evolved up to the point where she has no mouth and therefore she does not breathe either way.\n\nQ: And how does she not freeze to death? A: Evolution, just like above.\n\nQ: How does the game fill the theme “The more you have, the worse it is.”? A: The more you play the game, the more content you unlock. The more content you unlock, the more upgrades you can purchase. The more you purchase, the longer you can survive in a single run. The longer you survive, the more enemies you meet. The more enemies you meet, the more projectiles fly around. And of course, the projectiles you deflect can also kill you ;). So the more you have, the harder/worse it gets.\n\nQ: What progress does the game offer? A: You start off with 4 basic upgrade choices. As you keep playing, you will eventually unlock 3 special abilities. These abilities will unlock 3 more unique upgrade choices. While you keep unlocking upgrades for yourself, the enemy also gets some upgrades. There are 4 types of enemies (with same sprite).\n\nQ: What have you learnt during this Ludum Dare? A: I have learnt how to work with multiple scenes, how to pass info from one scene to another and how to work with effects and other nice features of Unity Engine. I have also learnt that it is possible to expand the simplest idea and make it into something relatively nice and playable.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//773/d/z/ce7b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/space-war-never-ends","author":{"name":"X Budsterized X","uid":54135,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/x-budsterized-x"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://michalidis.itch.io/space-war-never-ends"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z-2k4CA-p-KeBTvis21nE16OoJEQWILX"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Crazy Cat Lady","category":"jam","description":"You're a crazy lady living alone and taking stray cats in when ever someone brings you one, but as we all know, the more cats, the more work and poop comes your way and makes it harder to take care of each cat.\n\n[More Text Soon we really need sleep x.x]\n\nWASD to move\nE to pickup/interact\n\nSource is availble but due to build problems we have delayed stand alone builds.\n\nAdded Windows Build, GN","thumbnail_url":"","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/crazy-cat-lady","author":{"name":"Jacksendary","uid":201,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/jacksendary"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://bitbucket.org/Jackie0100/ldjam40"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/p7ru804x96sy5l6/WINx86.zip?dl=0"},{"label":"macOS","url":"soon.TM"},{"label":"Linux","url":"soon.TM"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"soon.TM"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Squeaky Mouse","category":"compo","description":"///content/453/01/z/ca63.jpg\nGenre:Platformer and shooter\nGame Engine Used: Unity\nDownload link[Windows Download]:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fcS72CTAnOTKhWvjPmimi_lsJpa5Bfcp?usp=sharing","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//453/01/z/ca63.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/squeaky-mouse","author":{"name":"GreenTitan","uid":66388,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/greentitan"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nHrKhQ-NY2dstTJDg64TmRK6BtRr6a5P"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Chuck Norris will Make America Great Again","category":"jam","description":"In the near future, American citizens grew tired of the corruption and deceit that has plagued it's Country.

You move to a peaceful wood cabin in the woods with your newly acquired canine companion Steve.\n\nSteve is a growing pup, and needs feeding. Whilst out hunting for puppy snacks, it becomes apparent that leaving the adventurer life behind you is not as easy as hoped. The forest is plagued with creatures and monsters - who seem hellbent on turning your retirement into a funeral.\n\nSteve is the only one you hold dear. You must feed him. The trouble is, each time you feed him - his appetite gets bigger, and you'll have to seek out more and more food for him from the perilous forest.\n\nIn addition to this, once an adventurer - always an adventurer. Eliminating the forest of threats will reward you with experience, which in turn will level you up. However, in your old age, each level up is not what it once was. Each level up will allow you to focus your experience in specific abilities - though each of these come with unfortunate side-effects. The more you level up, the harder it will be for you to gather enough food for your growing Steve.\n\nCan you keep Steve safe and fed? Will you keep up with his growing hunger? Or will your exeprience on the battlefield break you, rendering you unfit to protect your only true friend?","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ecb/c/z/d0ab.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/my-greed-dog-steve","author":{"name":"Honest Dan","uid":52174,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ecb/c/z/9234.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/honest-dan"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_hDvyLSaln1UrTUX9Zmc0paXd6Hsntek/view?usp=sharing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Ionising","category":"jam","description":"![Menu.png](///raw/8e6/2/z/bb58.png)\nWell, making this was an experience...\nMy friend supplied some excellent art assets, while I was making a full game in Unity for the first time (I'm more of a Java + Slick2D person).

Killing these monsters will give you more gold. The more gold you have, the heavier you get so you walk slower, also more monsters will be attracted to you if you have more gold, making it more difficult. There are items to spend the gold on which both make you stronger and make you have less gold which means temporarily less monsters. You have two attacks, a stab and a slash with your sword. The slash dos a bit of damage and knocks monsters back, the stab does not knock back much but does a lot more damage.\n\n## CONTROLS:\n\nWASD to move.\nLeft click in the direction of the monster to stab.\nRight click in the direction to slash.\n\n## HINTS:\n\nuse the slash often as a defensive attack and then only the stab to finish because it will not knock them back enough to keep them away.\n\nwalk backwards away from monsters while attacking them to give them less chance to hit you\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//01c/1/z/ae07.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/greed","author":{"name":"Ethan Allwood","uid":7184,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//01c/1/z/2b56.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/ethan-allwood"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://allwoodgamedev.itch.io/greed"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"FeedEm","category":"jam","description":"The game is very basic.

You control the direction in which the clot moves. White blood cells destroy some molecules, and 'malignant' ones stick to your molecule. Slowly everything starts getting faster. The clot will get bigger, and if the blood stops flowing you will lose. Scoring is based on the number of cells that pass through.\"\n\nI really had a lot of fun making this game. At some time in the competition I felt like giving up because my idea wasn't going as planned, but at the end I kept going and everything went right. This is probably my most complex code I've done, I mean, it is basic (I'm 16 years old, I know you don’t care), but I've used a lot of my different techniques of doing work.\n\nI've recorded a lot of footage for a BAD camera and audio so I am going to make a bad Post Mortem. Thankfully this counts like work for my school sooooo yeah, worth it. I hope y'all had fun coding. I have a lot of HW to do. \n\nPD: I didn't have Android APK and my game is for 1080x1920 resolution. I'm sharing all my work + you can use Unity play mode instead of APK or EXE. JUST MAKE SURE TO PUT IT ON 1080x1920, I mean it should work except the UI in other resolutions (because I had no time for resizing).

Human and machine intertwine in perfect harmony as with the help of the neuroweb, a single thought can raise a building, use any machine, connect to anyone on the planet or access all of human history at once.\n\n> 2120 A program called the Neuromancer takes control of the neuroweb. Man and machine lose free will, as humanity is enslaved, to an unforgiving rule of law and order. Humanity and machines reach a standstill as everything is forced to stay the same. Goodbye change, goodbye dreams.\n\n> A malfunction causes a few rogue humans to disconnect from the control of the neuromancer. These few outcasts are hunted to be re-enslaved. They control bits of the neuroweb and use it to fight back. The forces against them are strong but the instinct to survive is stronger.\n\n```\n```\n\n#### Game description:\n\n> Like tower defenses ? Like Platformers ? Like Survival Games ?

There's a catch tough, the more energy you collect the harder will be to move around the map, the more you have, the harder it gets.\n\n```\n```\n\n#### Gameplay:\n\n- move, run, jump, don't fall, stay alive.\n- avoid enemy drones.\n- build towers to protect yourself.\n- pay attention to your health and speed.\n\n```\n```\n\n#### Game controls:\n\n- movement: A/S or Left/Right-arrows\n- jump: SPACE\n- place towers: 1/2/3\n\n\n```\n```\n\n> Story environment:\n![Environment.jpg](///raw/232/01/z/c1c2.jpg)\n\n> In-game environment:\n![Environment_2.jpg](///raw/232/01/z/c1c4.jpg)\n\n> In-game characters:\n![characters.jpg](///raw/232/01/z/c6c9.jpg)\n\n> In-game screenshots:\n![screenshot_1.png](///raw/232/01/z/c99c.png)\n![screenshot_2.png](///raw/232/01/z/c99f.png)\n![screenshot_3.png](///raw/232/01/z/c9a6.png)\n![screenshot_4.png](///raw/232/01/z/c9a8.png)\n![screenshot_ui.png](///raw/232/01/z/c8d1.png)\n\n```\n```\n\n#### Our team:\n\n> 8 creative thinkers together.\nOne vision.

Pistol\n2. SMG\n3. Sniper\n4. Thompson\n5. Scar-H\n6. M1 Garand\n7. Neon Pistol\n8. Uzi\n9. Neon Thompson\n10.

The only way you can possiblly hold out is with help from the gods! If enough people pray hard enough, perhaps they will send the elements to your aid. The gods are not always merciful though, and the elements can be unforgiving.\n\nInstructions:\nAttackers will come in waves and your goal is to survive as long as you can. More attackers will come than you can defend against just building defenders, so you'll need help from the gods to survive.\nBuilders build homes. The more homes in your kingdom, the faster peasants will come.\nYou can send peasants to become builders (who build more homes), defenders, or worship one of the gods.\nAs each god is appeased, they will send one of a few corresponding natural disasters to your aid. While these will damage your enemies, they can also damage your troops and if you're unlucky, maybe even your keep!\n\nPostmortem:\nThis was a tough theme and we spent a long time brainstorming before we came up with an idea we liked. The goal was a survival game with city building/management elements where you would have to balance praying for various natural disasters as a way to defeat waves of enemies while keeping your people alive. The scope was overly ambitious but it was the idea that sounded most fun to us, so we went with it. It ended up being pretty much our previous LD game with a bunch of added features. I think that shows in that the gameplay is limited, and we never got to implementing any very interesting decisions. It would probably be better to have the worshippers die when they get to the shrine, as well as a mechanic where the gods get angry or jealous if you don't worship them enough. Right now it's probably optimal to just build shooters instead of worshippers.\n\nAs always though, lots learned and lots of fun.\n\n\n*more coming later*","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//470/3/z/cf9f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/pray-for-disaster","author":{"name":"Prakkus","uid":12404,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/prakkus"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://prakkus.itch.io/pray-for-disaster"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"FriendSpace","category":"jam","description":"Signup for FriendSpace today, and enjoy all the benefits of having friends!\n## Seeing Them At The Store ![Seeing Them At The Store](///raw/16/z/d42a.png)\n## Buying Them Gifts ![Buying Them Gifts](///raw/16/z/d42c.png)\n## Getting Presents ![Getting Presents](///raw/16/z/d426.png)\n\n**The more** *FriendSpace* **you have, the ~~worse~~ ** better **it is!**\n\n### Version History\nv1.0.2 (12-4-17) - Jam Release","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//16/z/ce5b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/friendspace","author":{"name":"HitchH1k3r","uid":97,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//16/z/6888.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/hitchh1k3r"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//16/z/d42a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//16/z/d42a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//16/z/d42c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//16/z/d42c.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//16/z/d426.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//16/z/d426.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://hitchh1k3rsguide.com/ld40/webgl/"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/hitchh1k3r/LudumDare40"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://hitchh1k3rsguide.com/ld40/webgl/ld40_windows.zip"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://hitchh1k3rsguide.com/ld40/webgl/ld40_macos.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://hitchh1k3rsguide.com/ld40/webgl/ld40_linux.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"crowglary","category":"jam","description":"run around with ur little birbs and a friend.\nhttps://voxeledphoton.itch.io/crowglary","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//559/z/c7bd.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/crowglary","author":{"name":"blackoptics8","uid":2389,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/blackoptics8"},"screens":[],"links":[],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"The School Work","category":"jam","description":"This game is a short simulation of your school life.

But caused by an explosion in the genlab next to the milkfactory, cows startet to mutate and want to get the milk back from the milkman or they just want to kill you. But you're the only milkman in the city and how are the people gonna get their milk if you can't bring it to them? So get the ** fu*ck ** up!\n\n#### Try to collect all empty bottles and replace them with full ones before the cows can get you!\n\nGood Luck!\n\nWhat we want to add in the future:\n* MORE COWS!\n* Highscores\n\n#### About the development process:\n\nThe theme this year wasn't the best as you can read by various other contributors but an unexpected idea came after half an hour of brainstorming. The idea didn't sound very complex and easy to build, but unfortunatly it was. \nBuilding the map was a real pain and while we were doing this our brains turned off. Luckily we finished the map on the first day after 15 hours of working. I can't imagine how horrible it would had become if we didn't finish. \nOn the second day our team (2 people) got some additional help by a third one (quite unexpected that he's the third one) and we quickly made a lot of progress. \nThe last day was the day of the cows. Pathfinding, animations, variants and bugfixes. Everything was quickly done and we started to run out of ideas to do before the deadline so we added music. None of us is only a tiny bit talented in music and composing, so the result was and still is surprisingly good.\nEnough talk about the last 72 hours, go play the game instead of reading this boring shit. \n\n#### Screenshots:\n\n![screenshot_1.png](///raw/293/c/z/c3af.png)\n\n\n![screenshot_2.png](///raw/293/c/z/c3b1.png)\n\n#### Sources: \n\nMostly it's done by us, but sometimes even we need some help by the glorious www.\n\n* Explosion-sound - https://www.freesoundeffects.com/free-sounds/cannon-10077/\n* Cow-sound - https://www.partnersinrhyme.com/soundfx/PUBLIC-DOMAIN-SOUNDS/animal1.shtml\n* Hit-sound - https://www.freesoundeffects.com/free-sounds/punch-10083/","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//293/c/z/a7c0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/milk-hunt","author":{"name":"Weizengaming","uid":50066,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/weizengaming"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//293/c/z/b90e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//293/c/z/b90e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//293/c/z/c3af.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//293/c/z/c3af.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//293/c/z/c3b1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//293/c/z/c3b1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/pturon/LudumDare/tree/Final_release_for_Ludum_Dare_40"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://weizengaming.itch.io/milkhunt"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://weizengaming.itch.io/milkhunt"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://weizengaming.itch.io/milkhunt"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux","mac"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Corruption","category":"compo","description":"Destabilise and corrupt the world, and test your computer's performance while you're at it.

As Santa, you will deliver presents directly through chimneys using his new Present Delivery Cannon™. Each house has a certain amount of presents that you are to deliver. Your score starts at 100 points per potential delivery you are to make, and for each present you fail to deliver you have those 100 points subtracted. For every present you waste either by missing or delivering to a house you've already finished delivering to, you lose further points.\n\nAt the end of your delivery route, provided your performance this year was satisfactory, you are given the option to increase present production for next year. This will increase the amount of presents you have, and so also the amount of presents you need to deliver.

I wanted to try out doing much lower res pixel art than I'm used to (16x16 instead of 64x64) this time around, and doing pixel art from top-down instead of the NSEW type of style I usually do. It was actually a lot harder than I thought! I also spent some more time than usual with getting the gameplay relatively polished. :)\n\nMy take on the theme was basically a mix between a [corgi conga line through the snow](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/60/f5/b1/60f5b1b26c1c0b633a45d0517610e151--sled-dogs-track.jpg) and getting piled on by a bunch of dogs because you have food. Thus we have this little game.\n\nEverything was created during the jam, except for the music/sounds, which was provided by others.

Over time, more and more Kritters will be dropped into the exhibit and you’ll have to take care of all of them.  As you meet the needs of the Kritters, you will gain points that increase your overall score.  Your supervisor, in his infinite wisdom, has decided that the higher your score, the faster he’ll drop in new Kritters for you to take care of.  Every time you fail to meet a Kritter’s need, they'll become sad and change colors!  If you fail to meet a Kritter’s needs 3 times, they'll die!  If three Kritters die… you’re fired!\n\nCan you become the top Kritter Keeper in the world?  Only time (and the **leaderboard**) will tell.\n\nControls\n - Use Q or click on the 1st button to change your cursor to the Food icon. \n - Use W or click on the 2nd button to change your cursor to the Water icon. \n - Use E or click on the 3rd button to change your cursor to the Care icon. \n - Use R or click on the 4th button to change your cursor to the Heal icon. \n - Use T,  click your right mouse button, or click on the 5th button to change your cursor to the Grab icon. \n\nTo care for Kritters, watch them closely and a need bubble will appear on them.  Change your cursor to the matching icon and click on the Kritter to fulfill that need.  Kritters needs must be met quickly, so act fast!\nYou can also pick Kritters up with the Grab icon and move them around the exhibit to make them easier to manage.\nLastly, the Heal icon is special.  A Kritter won’t ask to be healed, but at any time a Kritter is sad and has changed colors you can click them with the Heal icon to restore them by one level.  You cannot heal a Kritter beyond their initial health.\n\nGood luck Kritter Keeper!\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//6d3/z/c456.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/kritter-keeper","author":{"name":"Archimagus","uid":982,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//6d3/z/2dd2.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/archimagus"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//6d3/z/c460.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//6d3/z/c460.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://archimagus.itch.io/kritter-keeper"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://archimagus.itch.io/kritter-keeper"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://archimagus.itch.io/kritter-keeper"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://archimagus.itch.io/kritter-keeper"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"The Floor is Lava","category":"compo","description":"## Soar, shoot and dodge - but don't stop moving.\n\nYour goal is to go as deep as you possibly can.

I used Krita & GIMP for graphics and FL Studio 12.5 for Audio & Music. While I composed the music, I used Kick Drums and some other SFX from the FL Studio standard library and edited them a lot to fit them to the theme of the game. Most of the sound effects are cymbals or hi-hats with a lot of reverb and echo to them, thrown into a compressor that makes them sound distant. There was also a singer's \"Aah\" sound, which I used to create a haunting voice.\n\nI started making this on Saturday 7am and finished roughly 1-2 hours before the deadline. However, I got distracted for some hours. All in all, I was very happy with my time management and I hope you'll enjoy the game!

With each collected coin, the player will literally be weighed down by their greed, until their speed is reduced to an almost insufferable crawl. Additionally, the player can only carry a single held object at a time, so you'll need to manage your priorities and finances well if you wish to get far!\n\nHowever, scattered through the world are a number of shops which gladly lighten your load, offering not only items for sale but also handy Piggy Banks which will deposit your carried coins into a shared bank account.\n\n![screenshot1.png](///raw/bd4/e/z/a6d2.png)\n\nIn the shops you can purchase items such as keys to open challenge doors, planks to bridge chasms, a gun that literally fires coins from your pockets, or items such as a coin purse or winged boots to support your growing greed with a permanent speed increase. The shop at the world start will always offer one of each key at a set price while restocking after each purchase, or you can try your luck with the shops you can randomly discover during exploration which offer a random selection at random prices, though once you purchase an item from that shop it won't be restocked!\n\nAdditionally, during your travels you will find locked doors requiring specific keys or coins to open. Successfully unlocking one of these doors will open a new path of rooms which may contain even greater amounts of coins, a challenge to overcome, or perhaps a dead end. Some rooms might even contain a standing target which you can crack open with a well-placed shot to reveal a prize!\n\n![screenshot2.jpg](///raw/bd4/e/z/a6d4.jpg)\n\nFinancial Burden was created by FalseIncarnate during Ludum Dare 40 for the Compo, meaning the game was completely created from scratch and developed solo within 48 hours. For the game engine, I used Unity (2D) and C# for the scripting. For the sprite work, I managed to scrape together some workable programmer art using GIMP 2 (though it is very clearly programmer art). I opted to not include audio since I don't have any experience with audio-editing, though I plan to try and add some later (post-LD).\n\n![controls.jpg](///raw/bd4/e/z/a6d9.jpg)\n\nThis is my first time participating in Ludum Dare, and it has been an absolute blast!

The mushrooms grow at an alarming rate.  The management of your farm is vital due to the nature of the livestock you deal in.  These mushrooms hate being packed together in small spaces and will begin leaking out corruption when their emotions get too volatile, which begins attracting unwanted visitors from beyond the reaches of your farm.\n\nThese unwanted visitors are far tougher than the small mushrooms you're used to.  They constantly feed off of the corruption, making them far more resilient and tenacious than your average sentient vegetation. To deal with these circumstances, you have assembled a small arsenal to mitigate some of the threat these unwanted visitors may pose.  \n\nOn top of this, you can upgrade your robot to be able to collect mushrooms for you faster.  These utilities that you possess will be vital in maintaining your farm and keeping your produce healthy and untouched by the unwanted guests.\n\n\n### Made by @cadexlegend (programming) & @valmay (art)\n\n![cast.png](///raw/45c/2/z/c5cc.png)\n\n### screenshots of the game\n![s 1.png](///raw/45c/2/z/c477.png)\n\n![s 2.png](///raw/45c/2/z/c4d6.png)\n\n![s5.png](///raw/45c/2/z/c4df.png)\n\n![s6.png](///raw/45c/2/z/c4e5.png)\n\n![s10.png](///raw/45c/2/z/c4e8.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//45c/2/z/c1e2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/not-mush-room-left","author":{"name":"Valmay","uid":11348,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//45c/2/z/2ced.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/valmay"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//45c/2/z/c3d8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//45c/2/z/c3d8.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//45c/2/z/c5cc.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//45c/2/z/c5cc.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//45c/2/z/c477.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//45c/2/z/c477.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//45c/2/z/c4d6.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//45c/2/z/c4d6.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//45c/2/z/c4df.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//45c/2/z/c4df.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//45c/2/z/c4e5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//45c/2/z/c4e5.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//45c/2/z/c4e8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//45c/2/z/c4e8.png"}],"links":[],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Rise Of Corruption","category":"compo","description":"In this game you control a mountain outpost near a corruption portal. Grow your base by mining into the mountain to get coal, iron, gold and gems. However, the more of these resources you collect, the more corruption you will gain. The higher the corruption the worse the attacks will be against you. To defeat the corruption you will need to research several technologies to reduce how much is made and then finally remove the corruption you have to win the game. \n\n![Picture1.png](///raw/531/z/ae63.png)\n\nThere are several buildings that you need to place to grow your base\n- Ladder: Allows workers to access the tiles directly above and below the ladder\n- Worker Tools: Allows for an additional worker to help mine out stone and  construct new buildings\n- Research: Allows a worker to progress towards getting a tech (having more will speed up research)\n- Armoury: Lets a worker gear up and stand guard outside the base\n- Blacksmith: Allows coal and iron ore to be smelted into iron to be used elsewhere\n- Wooden wall: A basic defense to hold back the forces of corruption\n- Stone wall: A much stronger defense against the forces of corruption\n\nTo get wood, mark the trees for clearing\n\nMost buildings have their own worker type, unfortunately I didn't have time to change what they look like so if people just stand around its probably that they don't have anything to do most of the time.\n\nWhen you place a building, a worker will arrive to work it. If the worker is killed, a new one will be summoned when it is safe for it to arrive.

Using your machine gun, you must find and obliterate three fly nests located around the area, in which these nests spurt out hordes of maggots and flies which you need to take out.\n\nAs you begin to explore around the map, you'll notice that your player has an 'oxygen' level. Due to the flies, the air around this planet has become contaminated, therefore causing the main character to need a clean oxygen tank. Your 'oxygen' level will gradually decrease, and if it gets too low, your player will suffocate and die. If you want to stop this from happening, you can collect 'oxygen packs' that drop off of enemies. Around the map there are also oxygen tanks, which you can break open to give yourself more oxygen.\n\n![screenshot08.jpg](///raw/662/z/c605.jpg)\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTROLS\nWASD - Move\n\nMouse Button - Shooting\n\nSpace - Dash\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n### CREDITS\nProgramming - Megalink\n\nArt - Zyro / Ulkenstride / Gideon the Bard\n\nThis game was built in GameMaker Studio 1.4.\n\n----------------------------------------------------","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//662/z/c5e1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/infested","author":{"name":"Megalink","uid":614,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//662/z/2e32.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/megalink"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//662/z/c605.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//662/z/c605.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://getagames.itch.io/infested"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Embrace Space","category":"jam","description":"## Embrace Space\n\nYou raise your head in horror.

If you manage to get the ball inside the cup, you must drink the beer. Of course, the inebriation induced by the alcohol may cause some involuntary head motions and make hitting the cups slightly more difficult.\n\n# Gameplay\n\nYou throw a ball and attempt to get it in one of the cups. The strength of the throw can be varied and the ball con be controlled after throwing it.\n\nWhen the ball lands in a cup you drink it and get more drunk. This impacts your stability and hearing. The cup is removed from the table. WHen all the cups on the table have been removed, you get a new set of cups.\n\nYou get points for getting the ball inside the cups. How many points you get depends on what type of cup it is, and it multiplied by the amount of successful throws you have had in a row.\n\nWhen you miss two times in a row you lose a heart. The first time it starts flickering and the second time it goes dark.

When it finishes you should be able to run the game with  \n`./LD40.rb` or `ruby ./LD40.rb`.  \nIf there are still issues you might be missing some libraries used by Gosu.  \nCheck https://www.libgosu.org/ for more information.\n\n### Linux / MacOS\nEither use *wine* to run the windows executable or install *Ruby* and *Gosu*:\n#### Ubuntu (and Debian derivatives)\n```\n# Install the Ruby interpreter and Gosu's dependencies:\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install ruby build-essential libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libpango1.0-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libopenal-dev libsndfile-dev libmpg123-dev libgmp-dev\n# Install Gosu:\ngem install gosu\n```\n\n#### Arch Linux\n```\n# Install the Ruby interpreter and Gosu's dependencies:\npacman -Sy ruby openal pango sdl2 sdl2_ttf libsndfile pkg-config mpg123\ngem install gosu\n```\n\nOr use your distribution's package manager.\n\n#### MacOS\nBest you follow the steps on https://github.com/gosu/gosu/wiki/Getting-Started-on-OS-X  \nBut you can try:\n```\ngem install gosu\n```\nAs far as I know, the Ruby Interpreter comes pre-installed on MacOS.\n\n\n## Credits\n**Coding / concept** - @noahro  \n**Concept** - @hoichael  (Originally also worked on graphics, but we discarded those because we couldn't finish them in time.)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//11c/d/z/c9f4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/mother-earth-failed-planet","author":{"name":"NoahRo","uid":56337,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/noahro"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/Noah2610/LD40/archive/1.1_LD-release.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Free to Play","category":"jam","description":"\n# Hello, we're the Electrical Artists and this is Fee - uhh.. *cough cough* - Free to Play. \n\n![Titlescreen 2.png](///raw/4df/c/z/ce19.png)\n\nPlay it on the web: https://hooraygil.itch.io/fee-to-play\n\nIt's a 2D sidescrolling Platformer with heavy focus on microtransactions.

During all the commotion the restaurants newest recruit Barry is anxiously awaiting for the horde to ravage inside; peering out the window he can scarcely see the monstrosity that awaits. His attention is then broken by the screeching alarm of the clock that hangs above the big rectangular iron door; Barry checks his pen and paper for the last time and stares stoically towards the big door, his thumb absentmindedly on the end of the pen followed by a series of satisfactory clicks to calm his nerves. The door begins to beckon, light begins to seeps through the room, illuminating the floor with a golden shine; a moment of awe and wonder, until all is suddenly taken away when the door can no longer keep the blight at bay.  The great metal relic gives way and finally bursts open with an army of customers flooding in chanting and rampaging through the restaurant unaccounted for, Barry musters all the courage he can; exhaling slowly and whipping out his pen and paper in a calm fashion, he will be the one to strike the first order and last to serve last meal today; just like his father before him, his watch begins. It's time to show these abominations how to serve in style!!! \n\n## **Controls**\n- Arrow keys or WASD to move\n- Make your Key-binds in intro\n\n## **How to play**\n![Final1.png](///raw/b4f/2/z/bab2.png)\n![Final2.png](///raw/b4f/2/z/bab3.png)\n![Final3.png](///raw/b4f/2/z/bab4.png)\n![Final4.png](///raw/b4f/2/z/bab5.png)\n![Final5.png](///raw/b4f/2/z/bab7.png)\n![Final6.png](///raw/b4f/2/z/bab8.png)\n![Final7.png](///raw/b4f/2/z/bab9.png)\n![Final8.png](///raw/b4f/2/z/baba.png)\n![Final9.png](///raw/b4f/2/z/babb.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//6eb/z/badb.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/kitchen-things","author":{"name":"wrexialmt","uid":3046,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//6eb/z/3ec4.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/wrexialmt"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b4f/2/z/bab2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b4f/2/z/bab2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b4f/2/z/bab3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b4f/2/z/bab3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b4f/2/z/bab4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b4f/2/z/bab4.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b4f/2/z/bab5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b4f/2/z/bab5.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b4f/2/z/bab7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b4f/2/z/bab7.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b4f/2/z/bab8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b4f/2/z/bab8.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b4f/2/z/bab9.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b4f/2/z/bab9.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b4f/2/z/baba.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b4f/2/z/baba.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b4f/2/z/babb.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b4f/2/z/babb.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://www.dylanabela.com/games/LudumDare40/index.html"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Super Consumerism Sim 2K17: GOTY Edition","category":"compo","description":"Welcome to Super Consumerism Sim 2K17 GOTY Edition!\n\nYou have money.

The more cargo there is, the more cars your train consists of and the slower it travels, requiring you to spend more time on the run and making those crates an easy target for pursuers.\n\nIn addition to slower movement, having a large number of crates on board makes your train a more attractive target for bandits. You'll find that there will be more pursuers when your train is full, but as the number of crates you carry dwindles, so will the interest of the bandits: less and less of them will be inclined to join the chase.\n\n**How to play**\n\nUse your mouse to shoot at the bandits. Only the first enemy on the way of your shot will be killed (the shots don't pass through enemies).\n\nYour aim is to successfully protect your cargo so that by the time the train reaches its destination there are as many crates remaining as possible.

Hours of (un-saveable) fun right there!\n\n# Lousy Introduction (I'm tired)\n\nControls should be fairly intuitive. Mostly mouse and arrow keys.\n\nYou have a toolbox. Click at the top/bottom edges to scroll or use your mouse wheel.\n\nThe first tool is for interaction. Second is for removing things. Rest are for adding things.\n\nThe tile at the top is a dispenser. Place a switch next to it and turn the switch on in order to get it going.\n\nThere are also some hops for recycling. Currently, you can only extract metal (with a magnet).\n\nSwitches are the only things which can generate power. Wires carry power. Various things run off power.\n\nMultiple power signals going through a transistor will cancel out.\n\n# Cheats\n\nBrowser console:\n\nplayer.money = 1000000;\n\n# Misc Images\n\n![contraption.png](///raw/34a/z/b107.png)\n![terrain.png](///raw/34a/z/b0f4.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//34a/z/af56.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/garbage-disposal-tycoon","author":{"name":"kernel-panic","uid":2627,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/kernel-panic"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//34a/z/b107.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//34a/z/b107.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//34a/z/b0f4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//34a/z/b0f4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://ashleynewson.github.io/games/garbage-disposal-tycoon/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"CARnage","category":"jam","description":"[This game might not be suited for children.

This version also includes some minor bug fixes.*\n\n**Post Jam Version: https://rac-games.itch.io/nanonator-post-jam**\n\nIn this bullet-hell you become the bloodied hero of a child, a tiny robot, just nanometers in length that eliminates harmful microbia that threaten the young life. \n\nHow to play\n\nUse WASD or the arrow keys for movement, space for shooting and shift for activating your shields.\n\n\nWhy are there so many developers?\n\nThis team is an open university gamejam group for everyone to participate. Our students are mainly from maths, physics and biomedical engineering. The course runs the whole year and everyone can drop in and out at any time. This also means that nobody in the team is a fullfletched developer, artist or anything relevant to game design. Many of us have to learn everything from scratch DURING the gamejams. Any questions on how this course is organized, just PM Knorz.\n\n\nHow it went\n\nThis was our third entry and this time it was the worst experience so far. The theme wasn't our favourite and non of us managed to take a nap before the jam started at 3.00 a.m. here in germany. Our idea was to make a bullethell in which the controls changed the more weapons you had. You could describe it as a mix of guitar hero and a bullethell. We took really long (over 24 hours) for a working prototype and ... it was really really awful. So we scrapped the idea and went down the path of a \"normal\" bullethell.\nOne of our greatest issues was the lead of the team. Normally Knorz and jeb try to structure the group from beginning on, but we wanted to try a different setup this time. This didn*t turn out well, no one felt responsible and the communication was a mess leading to some tension.\nMore on the in our postmortem ...\n\n\n![Nanonator1.png](///raw/dd5/2/z/d03c.png)\n\n\nHow to play\n\nUse WASD or the arrow keys for movement, space for shooting and shift for activating your shields.\n\nGood luck and give 'em hell.\n\nPS: Try to beat our score :P\n\nhttps://rac-games.itch.io/nanonator","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//dd5/2/z/d02d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/nanonator","author":{"name":"RAC-Games","uid":9693,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/rac-games"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//dd5/2/z/d03c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//dd5/2/z/d03c.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://rac-games.itch.io/nanonator"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Public Opinion Monitor","category":"compo","description":"The theme leads me to a thought about what happened recently.\n\nSo that is a result for this afternoon.\n\nWon't say too much, 'cause if you can get it, you will.\n\nFor unpleasant news, you can either block or delete them.\n\nBut what is the result then?\n\n![Gif.gif](///raw/c99/1/z/a05e.gif)\n\n**How to Play**\n\nSince you control the public opinion monitor, you need to make sure that no bad comments on your government.\n\ni.e. good influence overcomes bad one shown on the right side of the game.\n\nYou can either do it with deleting news directly or block sensitive words.\n\nYet more rumors would survive if so.

The fewer bullets you have, the slower the enemies move.\n\n# TOOLS USED\n- [Unity](https://unity3d.com)\n- [TextMesh Pro](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/84126)\n- [Free Wave Samples](http://freewavesamples.com)\n- [Kenny Future Square](http://kenney.nl/assets/kenney-fonts)\n\n# QUICKFIXES\nFixed a bug where background color stops changing after level 20.\n\n# SOURCE\nThe source​ can be found at the bottom of the [game page](https://akirassasin.itch.io/aurora).","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//872/z/9f0c.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/aurora","author":{"name":"AkirAssasin","uid":632,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//872/z/2fdb.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/akirassasin"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://akirassasin.itch.io/aurora"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://akirassasin.itch.io/aurora"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Process Invasion","category":"jam","description":"Kill the viruses before they kill your computer!\nThe quantity of glitches increase with the quantity of viruses.\n\nSoftware used:\n* **Unity 3D** for the game\n* **FL Studio** for the audio\n* **Photoshop, Gimp, Cinema4D** for the graphics\n\n![Game screenshot](///raw/906/c/z/a506.png)\n\n![Game screenshot](///raw/906/c/z/a509.png)\n\n![Game screenshot](///raw/906/c/z/a50c.png)\n\n**Controls**:\n* **Arrows/AD**: Move\n* **Space**: Jump\n* **X/Left click**: Kill a process\n* **C**: Throw a bomb that kills a lot of processes\n* **Enter**: Reset\n\n**Target**:\nFind the Fork Bomb and destroy it, and keep CPU and Memory under 100% by destroying viruses.\n\nThe textures bug in the online version, please use the Windows version.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//906/c/z/a4c4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/process-invasion","author":{"name":"tuxmain","uid":50697,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/tuxmain"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//906/c/z/a506.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//906/c/z/a506.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//906/c/z/a509.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//906/c/z/a509.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//906/c/z/a50c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//906/c/z/a50c.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://zettascript.org/pro/ld40/r.php?d=rar"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://zettascript.org/pro/ld40/r.php?d=zip"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://zettascript.org/pro/ld40/r.php?d=rar_64"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://zettascript.org/pro/ld40/r.php?d=zip_64"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://zettascript.org/pro/ld40/webplayer.php"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Drink Drink DRINK","category":"compo","description":"![LudumDare40_screenshot_01.png](///raw/5ab/1/z/acd6.png)\n\n## Drink Drink DRINK - Ludum Dare 40 - \"The more you have, the worse it is\"\n\n[Play \"Drink Drink DRINK\" with WebGL!](http://departuregames.com/ludumdare40/)\n\n### Project\nIt's been awhile since I last participated in Ludum Dare, and I really wanted to make this one special. So, I decided to do something I usually don't do, focus much more on art, music, and polish. Making it is the most fun I've had in a Ludum Dare thus far. I completed this game in around 8 hours.\n\n### Premise\nThe premise is simple, finish as many drinks as you can before the bartender cuts you off. The more you drink, the harder it is to grab the next drink off the bar. The bartender is constantly judging you. Each time you grab and miss the bottle, he will get closer to cutting you off. When you've finally had more than you can handle, the game ends, and you can see the final tally of how many drinks you consumed.\n\n### Tools I Used\n- **Engine** - Unity 2017\n- **Drawing** - Inkscape\n- **Image Editing** - Paint.NET\n- **Sound Effects** - Audacity\n- **Music** - Loop Labs\n- **Programming** - MonoDevelop\n\n### Controls\n- **MOVE** - WASD or Arrow Keys\n- **GRAB** - Space

I've long ago giving up the idea of finishing a complete and fun game within the 48 hour limit, as this just seems way too difficult - so instead this time I've concentrated on a genre of game I've never attempted before: a racing game.\n\nI used a library which I have been building up over the last 7-8 Ludum Dares and this time around I had to write (copy/paste from stack overflow) some new methods for particular collision/response code but I still managed to get a full track generator, track/car physics and a crude A.I. racing around. The challenge is definitely shallow: simply finish the track without exploding.\n\nAs usual, I left too little time to do any decent graphics and I totally neglected soundFX/music (the only music is from Incomputech: of course I disabled the sound rating).\n\nThere is definitely a lot of room to expand on this game in coming weeks: pickups, weapons being the obvious missing components to make this a proper 2d wipeout clone - and better track generation with loops, intersections and jump would be cool. The vehicle physics are quite fun, although there is no real opportunity to use the hand-brake which is a shame.\n\n***\n\nInstructions:\n\nWASD   - movement\nSPACE  - Air-brake\nM      - Toggle music on/off\n\n***\n\n![title.png](///raw/49/z/b745.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//49/z/abe9.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/tachyon-r","author":{"name":"Lintfordpickle","uid":148,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/lintfordpickle"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//49/z/b8c7.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//49/z/b8c7.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//49/z/b745.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//49/z/b745.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://lintfordpickle.itch.io/tachyon-r"},{"label":"web","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kaVwLjdKoI&feature=youtu.be"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Save Your Gold","category":"jam","description":"![2.jpg](///raw/eef/1/z/b549.jpg)\n\nYou are a **rich goblin**, whose peace is being constatnly disturbed by greedy (more greedy than you) **racoons**.

Go for big healthy yellow Slime population. They won't multiply and they change color at half rate. Only tend to yellow Slime when you want to specifically pick it up and give it away.\n- Yellow Slime turning into red Slime resets the multiplication timer of blue Slime. \n- Yellow Slime turning into blue Slime resets the explosion timer of the red Slime. So it is useful to let the mood of the Slimes change all the way.\n- Don't unneccessarily turn slimes blue as they will soon multiply out of control(Less blue slimes the better).\n- Carrying blue slime halts the timer on multiplication. Its good to always carry one.\n- Don't ignore red Slimes, tend to them! Left untended they will explode, create slowing goo and spawning more red Slimes. Together red Slimes will devise a master plan to overthrow your rule!\n\n\n\n\n\n**:white_check_mark: 4/12/2017 v1.0 - v1.1.3**\n\n- HTML5 Version now available.\n- Difficulty curve drastically lowered.

All information is given below.\n\n:warning: **Audio might not be properly balanced.** Please adjust your audio before proceeding. There will be no music in this entry.\n\n-----\n\n>**You have a gun. A revolver, in fact. But somehow, there is something wrong with it.** You somehow feel weaker depending on the cartridge. Despite this, you take this as a challenge for yourself and attack a nearby vortex randomly going around. Sadly, the vortex knows it all and they will take advantage of it.\n\nSadly, this game would have more that that but I have to comprimise. Rather, than a level or two, I'll give you guys a boss battle. It could be really hard, really easy or really cheap, depending how much you know how the mechanics works.\n\n### :beginner: CONTROLS:\n* **Movement**\n * **Left & Right Arrow Keys:** Move around, wall slide\n * **Up Key or Space:** Jump, wall jump\n * **Left Shift:** Quick Dash, uses your energy\n* **Revolver**\n * **X Key:** Shoot, does nothing but click if you run out of ammo\n * **C Key:** Reloads your bullets back, also uses your energy\n* **System**\n * **Esc Key:** Returns to main menu, there is no pause function (Out of time to implement)\n * **R Key:** Restart game\n\n### :beginner: MECHANICS:\n**The Goal:** Defeat the vortex in 4 hits and survive.\n\nIn relevance to the theme, (**The more you have, the worse it is**) I tried to implement it to the player character itself. Almost every aspect of your character will hinder you depending the amount of bullets you have.\n\n**The more bullets you have, the following will happen:**\n- Take more damage against everything\n- Movement slows down\n- Heavier gravity\n- Energy recharge slows down\n- The vortex will attack more frequently\n- It's impossible to wall climb with 5 or more bullets\n- The player will gain passive regeneration as soon as you have no bullets\n\n***I encourage you to at least beat the boss once.*** *You will be rewarded for your efforts.*\n\n### :speech_balloon: QUESTIONS:\n* If you have any questions, feel free to ask from my twitter: [@fiaKaiera](http://twitter.com/fiaKaiera)\n* Contact immediately if the EXE shows an installer instead of the game straight away.\n* You can also contact me or comment if there's bugs found here. I'll fit it as fast as possible.\n\n:ballot_box_with_check: **Changelog:**\n* **DEC 4 @ 8am PST**\n  * HTML5 Port is now available! You can play it in your browser now.\n* **DEC 4 @ 1pm PST**\n  * Changed Z/X controls to X/C in order to compensate with QWERTZ keyboards\n  * Adjusted movement speed (you don't move ultra slow or ultra fast now)\n    * Despite this, you still can't slide a wall with 5 or 6 bullets\n    * From x0.1-x2.5 to x0.5-x2\n  * Adjusted gravity multiplier (x2 to x1.5)\n  * Fixed particles spawning every frame when moving\n  * Minor optimizations\n* **DEC 5 @ 3am PST**\n  * **Changes:**\n    * Changed stage layout for balance\n    * Stopping friction is much more strict\n    * Minimum movement speed is now .5 (.4 before)\n    * Shoot delay is now 3 frames less\n    * Energy recovery influence is now %70 (than %90)\n  * **Fixes:**\n    * Fixed R being read as an A\n    * Fixed Boss not slightly moving faster per hit\n    * Fixed character continuously hitting against a wall when repeatedly being hit\n      * Now bounces off the other direction instead\n    * Fixed rare bug where character stays stuck on death\n    * Fixed recharge time being inverted (slow on no bullets and fast with full clip)\n\n-----\n\n:bangbang: **Note for Windows Users:** There will be two versions for Windows: a **standalone *EXE** file, and a ** *ZIP** file. *If your anti-virus detects the* **.exe file as a virus, either allow it since it's a false-positive or, get the ZIP version instead.*\n\n:bangbang: **Note for Linux & Mac Users:** As I don't have the proper tools for exporting through Linux and Mac just yet. *I recommend using wine to test this.*\n\n:bangbang: **Note for HTML5 players:** As I recall, this only works on Firefox.

Find your way to your love one. \n\nTile base logic Puzzle adventure. Avoid Dangers, Avoid picking too many Resources, Avoid BackTracking too Much. \n\n\nThe game mechanic revolves around trying to manage risk of death and accumulating of too much inventory. You will come to realize that keeping the right items in your inventory when you need them the most is very hard.\n\nYour inventory will follow you where ever you go and surround you always. Therefore it is prone to falling off the cliff, being eaten by sharks, catching on fire, and being taken by snakes.\n\nThe more Inventory you have the harder the choices get. Risk taking on danger for a bigger tile to safe your inventory or risk losing a lot of inventory to resources falling off the cliff for a safer path. \n\nHints:\n\n- Solve the tutorial it will teach you a lot of basic mechanics and advance mechanics very useful for the Main game\n\n- If you do the tutorial the top path is solvable but RNG dependent.. the bottom path is logic puzzle no RNG\n\n- Before your first move zoom out use the WASD to look around and study the map.  Get a idea of the path you would like to Walk\n\n- Managing you inventory is hard. A strategic detour or dumping might be necessary   \n\n- And Keys... Always Keys \n\n- Water is a bitch when you don't have a boat. And boats wont save you from sharks...  remember Jaws\n\n\nFinal words of wisdom this is a longer game for LD.

You die if your fire reaches zero, or if you fall too far.\n\nYou bounce off normal platforms, lose fire from water platforms and recovers fire from fire platforms. Jumping on top of enemies also gives you more fire.\n\nBouncing is automatic, but fire platforms allow you to stop and wait. When you're ready, bounce off it with the action (Space key) button to execute a dash and kill any enemy in your way!\n\nFireboy grows bigger and faster as you fill the fire meter. The more fire you have, the more you can dash. If you manage to max out your fire meter, your score will be multiplied by the total duration that you kept your fire maxed.\n\nBe careful, though, the more fire you have, the faster enemies will spawn! Fire platforms will not be generated as frequently when your fire meter is high.\n\nThe game uses the gameboy color palette, because I'm a programmer and I don't understand how color works at all xP\n\nThe was developed using Love2d.

You'll have to be sneaky and avoid them while you try to get all the treasures you can, but be careful, carrying many treasures at once can make you have a hard time trying to escape from the guards!\n\n## Summary\n\n**Objective:** Pick as many tresures as you can and bring them to the starting zone to obtain your reward. Avoid security guards and try to get the highest score before running out of time.\n\n- Each object has a value and a weight. Carrying heavy items will decrease your movement speed.\n- If the guards see you, they will start chasing you.

I can see a marked improvement from the first game, in:\n\n- Graphics: The first game had poorly scaled, ugly looking and mostly unananimated graphics, all of which were successfully patched out of this iteration.\n- Sounds: Though admittedly, I used Digital Ether as my main battle music, which I do not own, I was able to make decent sound effects by overlaying multiple sounds, such as the roll animation, made up of cloth, swoosh and a recording of me hitting the desk with my arm. All of the sounds used are made by me or royalty free.\n- Time Management: I was able to tackle a more ambitious game then my last (a chicken with only WASD controls), by actually prototyping and balancing the game with developer art before moving onto the graphics and sounds.\n- Effects: The first game having almost no effects, this time, I included vignettes, dust particles, screen shakes, hit flashes, charged animations, roll-ready indicators, camera movement etc\n\nI would have liked to make shadows for the characters, but during development it became too buggy and I had to abandon it. I would also like smoother animations, and possibly better character designs for the goblins. Also, due to various activities that I had during the jam, including watching a movie, I ended up staying up to 5am on the last day, something which could have been easily avoided if I trusted myself to wake up and work in the morning so close to the deadline at 1pm. Turns out all-nighters suck. To anyone reading this avoid it at all costs!\n\nThat about sums it up.

But on the plus side I learnt some handy new things!\n\nTutorial:\n\n1. First select a country to prospect. Prospecting will cost you a certain amount per hour depending on the country. The country will turn black on the map whilst being prospected, click the prospect button again to cancel.\n \n2. Each hour there is a chance that your prospectors will strike oil (woo!) these will appear as an white oil barrel icon on the map.\n\n3. Click one of these barrels to build a rig. Each rig has an initial build cost and a hourly cost. (Rig staff cost on the country panel on the left). NOTE: Rigs cannot be destroyed once build so be careful! Rigs will generate crude oil barrels for that country. These can be viewed on the country panel (left).\n\n4. You also have the option of building a refinery in one country. This is a one time build cost and will turn the country red. You may only have 1 refinery at a time.\n\n5. Once you have a refinery you can begin shipping crude oil barrels to that country to process into refined oil. The cost of shipping is an hourly rate based on the distance between the production country and the refinery country. Your crude oil barrels and refined oil barrels will then appear on top status bar (alongside your money).\n\n6.

But it doesn't stop there, stockpiling munitions and having too many crew members will also dampen your abilities. Maybe you can afford to jettison some of those crew members...

It's been a tough and tiring but fun and rewarding 72 hours, and I'm happy just to be able to deliver at least minimal gameplay.\n\nI present to you - riskREWARD! The more you have, the-... well, actually I didn't quite follow the theme too closely. In this game, you play a character on the run who have to deliberately be a target for the police while dodging bullets in order to gain score. \n\nMy original ideas included stealth and hacking gameplay, but of course I didn't have time to implement those overambitious elements. My biggest gripe is that I wasn't able to properly implement the randomly generated level. This game was supposed to take place inside an maze-like urban office environment. Regardless, I shall continue to experiment with this until I can get it right for my future projects.\n\nWorking alone means having to split my development time among designing, coding and creating art assets, but it also allows me to have a first hand experience on how closely each department affects the others, and how compromises and balances have to be made frequently and iteratively.\n\nAs a newbie indie developer, I'm always looking for ways to improve my game design & development skills. Here's to more game jamming in the future! \n\nEnjoy the game, and I always appreciate constructive criticism so I know how I can do better next time.

As a participant in the rush to find and mine sanguinite for profit, you happen upon a system inundated with it. However, the native life seems to be especially dangerous and easily agitated by your mining efforts.\n\nYou remotely control an armed mining drone whose mission is to explore each planet to find valuable salvage and, above all, sanguinite. You have a limited number of drones, and the more you take from each landing site the more hostile the native life becomes. The creatures seem connected to the mineral. Perhaps there are secrets to learn here as well?\n\n***\n\n### Instructions\nYou control an armed mining drone in each mission, equipped with omni-directional thrusters to fight gravity and explore the crevices around the landing site. Your drone is designed to grab and haul cargo back to the dropship. Your goal is to retrieve all of the sanguinite in the area. Additionally, useful salvage can be found and retrieved that can upgrade your drones.\n\nExploration is rewarded. However, the more you take from the planet, the more hostile the enemies will become. Sanguinite requires a bit of mining to dislodge it from its deposit and will especially enrage the native life.

You get score by eating villagers and you get damaged by the enemy cannons, dodge the cannonballs and eat the villagers in an attempt to get a high score.  Don't be deceived by it's ease at first, the more score you have the more cannons spawn, the harder it is to dodge and the cannonballs do more damage.\n\nOur take on the theme, 'The more you have, the worse it is.' Is that you're this monster and the more you have in your stomach the bigger you are, therefore it's harder to dodge, therefore your conditions are worse\n\n\nCredits:\nCoding - Algebru Discord: @Algebru#9526\nMusic and Art - Lukas Harman Discord: @HorseSaysQuack#5995\nGame Design - Both\n\nSource code (if you want to see an example of spaghetti code): https://github.com/ALGEBRU/ld40\n\nNote - I don't know if the Linux or mac builds work as i don't have a mac or linux computer so... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nItch.io Page: https://algebru.itch.io/ludum-dare-40","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//05e/3/z/c7a1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/eat","author":{"name":"Algebru","uid":15952,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/algebru"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//05e/3/z/cdbc.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//05e/3/z/cdbc.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//05e/3/z/cdbf.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//05e/3/z/cdbf.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//05e/3/z/cdcc.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//05e/3/z/cdcc.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//05e/3/z/cdcf.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//05e/3/z/cdcf.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//05e/3/z/cddd.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//05e/3/z/cddd.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://algebru.itch.io/ludum-dare-40"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://algebru.itch.io/ludum-dare-40"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://algebru.itch.io/ludum-dare-40"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://algebru.itch.io/ludum-dare-40"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://algebru.itch.io/ludum-dare-40"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Don't Be Rash","category":"jam","description":"![Title01.png](///raw/1db/4/z/b4de.png)\n![Preview.gif](///raw/1db/4/z/b519.gif)\n\nPlay at Itch.io: https://cosmicadventuresquad.itch.io/dont-be-rash\n\n#### :raised_back_of_hand: Summary\n\nHelp Itchman get some ointment for his rash!

It's self-titled I guess, the name seemed to fit!\n\nTheme was \"The more you have, the worse it is\". I didn't follow it super literally, but basically it is a bunch of interconnected levels where you try to get as good of a score as possible on each one by collecting fruit.\n\nKilling enemies makes fruit disappear, so to have MORE fruit you have to move around a bunch of enemies without killing them to get a good score. Also the more you have explored, the harder it is? I dunno I mainly wanted to make a NES Zelda style game on a cool island. I was gonna make more enemies appear after each eaten fruit but didn't really have time to balance that element enough to release it.\n\nTo advance to the next screen you need to kill all the (killable) enemies in one screen - after doing this once this level is open forever though.\n\nBest scores + how far you have advanced is saved between sessions.\n\nThe Web build seems to work well but looks a fair bit worse than the normal build - no shadows kills the Day/Night cycle in the game + makes it look way worse in general!

The more you have, the worst it is.\n\nLook for the stairs to go deeper and you might find more treasure, or a quicker end... Remember to return to the surface sometimes to save what you already got and upgrade your stuff. Though keep in mind, risk is rewarded and if you do more levels in a row you will find even more treasures!\n\nTry to see how much treasure you can loot and beat your friends to it on the leaderboard!\n\n**How to play:**\n\n- Move: wasd\n- shoot: left click\n- reload: r\n- machine gun: 1\n- shotgun: 2\n\nEnter the Tomb and loot as much as you can on coffers and mummies you kill. The more treasure you have the further the mummies will hear you and come after you. Also beware of the traps!\n\nWhen you find the staircase down you have a choice. You can go back to the surface to \"get some rest\", this will save your score and heal you. Or you can \"continue\" to the next depth and will get a loot bonus for doing several levels in a row but beware as monster and loot become more numerous and dangerous with depth.\n\nOn the surface you can use the money you just looted to improve your equipment and skills at the store. Don't worry, the score is saved before you spend money so you don't loose score. You can only use what you just looted (not your whole score) and it will be set back to 0 when you go back in the tomb. So you better loot as much as you can before going back to buy a lot of upgrades! When you go back in the tomb, you will go back to the depth at which you were last, but any bonus will be rested. \n\nDeath is definitive and you will be prompted for you name to add to the leaderboard at that point.\n\nHope you like our game!\n\n**[Play now on the web!](http://asteroidlab.com/games/greedymummyii/)**\n\n[Or check the itch.io page](https://vademetro.itch.io/greedy-mommy-2)\n\n**Credits**\n\nDevs:\n- Guillaume\n- Minimata\n- Sebastien\n- Yukaword (John)\n- Yann\n- Citarox\n- Romane Donnet\n- Dan Bourquin\n\nArt:\n- Cyndesign (J.H)\n- Aminata\n- Swan Keller\n- Charline Saucy\n\nMusic & Fx:\n- Cyril\n\nGame Design:\n- Alexis Giard\n\n\n*Special thanks to Oniroforge for hosting the gamejam in Fribourg.*\n\nPS: there was never a first game, but we are greedy so we start directly with the second.\n\n![Entry.PNG](///raw/b00/5/z/be8f.png)\n\n![Start.PNG](///raw/b00/5/z/c010.png)\n\n![Exit.PNG](///raw/b00/5/z/bf60.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b00/5/z/b8d7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/greedy-mummy-ii","author":{"name":"AlexisGea","uid":20491,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b00/5/z/3305.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/alexisgea"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b00/5/z/be8f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b00/5/z/be8f.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b00/5/z/c010.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b00/5/z/c010.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b00/5/z/bf60.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b00/5/z/bf60.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://asteroidlab.com/games/greedymummyii/"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://vademetro.itch.io/greedy-mommy-2"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://vademetro.itch.io/greedy-mommy-2"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"grooOW!","category":"compo","description":"**Platformer game with puzzle elements!** Pick up all the dots to advance to the next level.

Help them to fall asleep, or call 911 trying.\n\nSo, you have a sleep scale on top of the screen, and the number of points that is constantly decreasing (karma, huh?). At the bottom there are pills, clicking on which, you make the current freelancer fall asleep for some period of time. Each pill has its own cooldown (the stronger it is, the longer it takes). Your task is to give various sleeping pills to our freelancers, get into the gold zone and put them to sleep. Be careful! If they take too much, scale will fall into the red zone and cause an overdose, which will end the game. The one who will put to bed the biggest number of freelancers wins.

One day while browsing the latest books, you discover it's actually quite a lot simpler than you thought. In fact, the whole recipe consists of just five items.

The monsters are dangerous, but their skins are valuable. But be wary to travel with lots of money or skins, as the monsters will smell it, and become more aggressive. They will also steal third of your skins and money when they hit you.

You'll do so by drifting, and once you grow too big by being filled with too many candies, be careful of not going too fast or turning around too quickly or you might lose control!\n\n## Controls\n\n- Keyboard\n  - Move: WASD/ZQSD or Arrows\n\n\n- Controller\n  - Move: Left Stick\n\n## Tools\n\n- Unity\n- Photoshop\n- Maya\n- Substance Designer\n- Substance Painter\n- ZBrush\n\n## Builds\n\nAvailable:\n- Windows\n\nComing soon:\n- Linux\n- MacOS\n\n## Notes\n\nUnfortunately I missed some time to improve the controls, I re-did them late in the LD and had ton of things left so couldn't spend more time on it, and the IA could benefit some polish too, IA is quite hell in a LD moreover being solo dev with 3 artists ahah I'll do a post-mortem later on from my point of view, as programmer, if you're interested in that. :)\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![LD40_2017-12-04_19-20-34.png](///raw/77b/2/z/b9dc.png)\n\n\n![LD40_2017-12-04_19-21-11.jpg](///raw/77b/2/z/b9dd.jpg)\n\n\n![LD40_2017-12-04_19-22-33.jpg](///raw/77b/2/z/b9df.jpg)\n\nHave fun ! :D","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//77b/2/z/a49e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/pina","author":{"name":"MewSoul","uid":11127,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//77b/2/z/464c.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/mewsoul"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//77b/2/z/b87e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//77b/2/z/b87e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//77b/2/z/b9dc.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//77b/2/z/b9dc.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//77b/2/z/b9dd.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//77b/2/z/b9dd.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//77b/2/z/b9df.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//77b/2/z/b9df.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://mewsoul.itch.io/jam-pina"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://mewsoul.itch.io/jam-pina"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://mewsoul.itch.io/jam-pina"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"Brewry","category":"jam","description":"![Ingredients.png](///content/ac7/c/z/a14f.png)\n\nA game about masterful potions, mysterious ingredients, and manic brewing.\n\nNote: We did not have time to add proper sound and music :/\n\nTeam;\nMe and @Asger-HB","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ac7/c/z/a14f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/brewry","author":{"name":"Lumme","uid":51146,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/lumme"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ac7/c/z/a14f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ac7/c/z/a14f.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://regsagc.itch.io/brewry"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop"]},{"ld_issue":40,"title":"A time paradox","category":"compo","description":"                                                  Description\n> If a me from the past came to see me, the temporal paradox could well destroy spaceti… *– A time traveller*\n\nA time loop!

Unfortunately just a day before LD started my wacom tablet started malfunctioning(turning off and on spontaniously) and I didn't manage to fix it in time(I still don't know if it fixable) so this sudden problem slowed me 2-3 times. No surprise that I didn't make it in time even for Jam entry. The game is vastly unfinished alas. To the point that there is a whole set of heavy armor animations left unused:\n![bikini_char_ha_idle.png](///raw/2fe/z/d71e.png)\nSo it is almost no content in jam version of the game. Also complete lack of sound.

To develop it fast, you need to have as many higher tier buildings as possible, and to keep your citizens happy, you need to fulfill all of their needs by clicking on the buildings with a popup above them. As you grow your city you will get more revenue as well as more elite newcomers with higher tier buildings. If you don't have enough money to buy higher tier buildings, you should get some trees because they attract newcomers too.\n\n# How to play?\n\nTo get going, you just need to buy a few buildings and wait for new citizens to come. In the meantime you can keep your citizens happy by clicking the buildings that have popups above them. After earning enough money, you should stop buying tier 1 buildings and focus on tier 2 and 3. If you place a building incorrectly or just want to remove it, just use the bulldozer tool at the bottom right and click on the building you want to remove.

Especially to @Nuflee, @retrokin, @brastin3, @grubber_music, @BeerGoat, @R_Panda, @Lord_Am, @ngBattery and @adventuretimeworldwide!\n\nThis is a **Celeste-inspired 2d exploration platformer**, where you play as a guy, who found his self in a strange, mysterious world. He attempts to find his way back, to his world and recover the past. Collect strawberries, fight monsters, avoid spikes, solve puzzles. \n\nThe game is written using tiny fantasy console, called **PICO-8**. It limits you to use 16 color palette, 128x128px screen, 128x64px sprite space, 128x64 tiles map. I really enjoy using it, tho it is really limiting. \n\nThe game has 25 levels, **including a BOSS LEVEL**. I've spent a lot of time and effort on making everything look great and smooth (just watch some animations ;)). The game will automatically save your progress. Also, you can swap the palette on go (read menu part for that)! \n\nI hope, that you will enjoy it!\n\n### Controls\n\n* **Arrows** - move\n* **Z/C** - jump\n* **X** - double jump from evil essences \n* **Enter/P** - open the pause menu\n\nTwo main things, you need to know:\n\n![berry.p8_0.gif](///raw/d2f/z/d6a4.gif) \n\n_Look for objects with tint, they will help you or kill you_\n_People miss those ropes a lot_\n\n![berry.p8_1.gif](///raw/d2f/z/d6a5.gif)\n\n_You can double jump from evil essences, once you touch them_\n\n### Speedrun mode\n\nYeah, I want to go though this quickly, there is a speedrun mode, build into the game! Once you kill the boss, you from the main menu can select any level, you want, and train on it. \n\nThe game also shows you your time and death count on every death. **If you will speedrun it, let me know in the comments!**\n\n### Mechanics (pss, spoilers!)\n\n##### Jumping\n* You can jump only from the ground\n* Trampolines launch you up into the sky\n* You can control your jump height, by holding the jump key longer/shorter\n##### Ropes\n* You can't jump from ropes, only climb on them using arrows\n##### Keys / berries\n* You need to deliver them to the door/exit to make use of them\n##### Evil \n* Once you use an essence, your screen becomes a bit more corrupted. This effect is being decreased if you wait, till the essence respawns.\n* You can dash from essences using X\n* Skulls die, when you use an essence\n* Essences respawn with time\n* Essences control the Dragon Fruit\n##### Ice\n* Ice disappears when you touch it \n* It respawns after a while\n##### Invisible blocks\n* You can notice them, only if you are close enough to them\n* They will block your way, and will not let you fall/pass\n##### Platforms\n* Normal platforms bounce from blocks and destroy ice\n* Cloud platforms go through blocks\n##### Dart Traps\n* They shoot out bullets with the same speed, but always async\n##### Background Tiles\n* If you see, that some parts of the background are lighter than the other, that could mean, that you can stand on them\n\n![test_4.gif](///raw/d2f/z/a2eb.gif)\n\n_Huh, that was easy!_ \n\n### The pause menu\n\n![Screenshot from 2017-12-03 23-31-15.png](///raw/d2f/z/a3a1.png)\n_Yup, this one_\n\n* **Continue** Get back to the game\n* **Next palette** <3 change the game palette\n* **Restart the lvl** Restarts current level\n* **To the last lvl** Moves you one level back (not always aviable)\n* **Reset progress** BE CAREFUL! This option erases your save (except palette and boss flag). That means, that you will loose all your progress in the game. \n\n### General tips\n\n* Don't try to go fast, you can always make it slower (unless you are in the speedrun mode)\n* Try to play with the palettes, strangely, but that helps to focus more on the content. I prefer the red and yellow one.\n* There is an options menu (activate it using enter), it contains a lot of useful stuff, as well as the palette settings\n\n![test_2.gif](///raw/d2f/z/a2df.gif)\n\n_Is evil really so harmless?_\n\n### Change log\n\n* **v0.1d, v0.1.f** Fix music not playing\n* **v0.1c** Noise is not so annoying now\n* **v0.1b** Fix kill() bug, change default palette\n* **v0.1** Initial release for the compo\n\n### Gameplay\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89AK3xoX9mE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89AK3xoX9mE)\n\n### Update\n\n**WOW, guys, thank you so much!
