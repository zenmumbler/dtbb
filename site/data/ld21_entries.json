The objective is to kill yourself - or rather, the body you're haunting. Experiment with things like dying from fall damage or getting squished by moving objects.\n\nImportant: install the included font before playing. The game loves it so much, it seems to crash without it. Thanks to Joeyy from #ludumdare for helping me discover this. After that, start the game from /dist/curse.exe. The necessary few attributions can be found in readme.txt. And let's not forget bfxr for the sound effects.\n\nA & D to move, W to jump (even when falling), S to flip switches. R to retry if you get stuck.\n\n-\n\nI initially submitted this game with several hours to go. Due to feedback, the update submitted on the extended time added a simple level 0.\n\nFor people with small screens (such as laptop users): I've made an alternative version which runs in a 608x448 window. This in turn made some animations play back faster, so I also slowed them down to roughly the original speed. Otherwise the code is unchanged, it's merely a bugfix. Thanks to Wallacoloo for mentioning this. \n\n1.0d fixed a missing hard-coded event in the fifth level.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/821176a15630464dea66356f119b1897.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=5551","author":{"name":"Jiggawatt","uid":5551,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d77bce3a74261db623f82b2af88a2587?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/ointment/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5551-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5551-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5551-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5551-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5551-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5551-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5551-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5551-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5551-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5551-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?n9kz4wc98b2m55f"},{"label":"Windows (for small screens)","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?j3skgwf45z5bi80"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?8z8tjh3da3jwj42"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":2,"score":4.21},{"area":"audio","rank":70,"score":3.29},{"area":"coolness","rank":87,"score":6},{"area":"innovation","rank":101,"score":3.44},{"area":"overall","rank":102,"score":3.33},{"area":"fun","rank":131,"score":3.06},{"area":"graphics","rank":158,"score":3.17},{"area":"humor","rank":205,"score":2},{"area":"theme","rank":230,"score":3}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Escape The Overgrowth","category":"jam","description":"standard wasd, left mouse shooter\nunfinished, buggy, unoptimized, but whatever, i'm going to bed","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ad1ed302f1d41e5b4225691d08344d1c.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=5781","author":{"name":"brachyonic","uid":5781,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/449f0db7e495a52ed61083e244c54b7f?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/brachyonic/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5781-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5781-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5781-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5781-shot1.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/brachyonic/Escape-The-Overgrowth"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/brachyonic/Escape-The-Overgrowth"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":64,"score":2.13},{"area":"fun","rank":75,"score":1.63},{"area":"overall","rank":86,"score":1.38},{"area":"theme","rank":88,"score":1},{"area":"graphics","rank":88,"score":1.25},{"area":"coolness","rank":418,"score":0},{"area":"community","rank":529,"score":1}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Escape Velocity","category":"compo","description":"Well... its in no way finished, but here's my firstest ever Ludum Dare entry.\n\nThe idea behind the game was that you had stolen an ultra-fast prototype military motorbike and then had to make a quick getaway.

I also wrote the game using Literate Programming as a methodology, so all the source code is described in the README file inside the package, in pain text and PDF formats.

It's essentially a frantic game of attrition, getting quicker and quicker until The Runner ultimately dies. With any luck, you'll get more and more panicked as your Light starts to dwindle and more and more enemies start to spawn.\n\nThe controls and instructions are in-game, but let me know if anything needs explaining.\n\nThe graphical style ended up looking really cool in action, but there are a few things I would change if I did it again (most of them involving getting more sleep and ingesting less caffeine in some way).\n\nOne major note that I forgot to put into the instructions is that powerups have a chance to drop from enemies when they die. Light+ boosts The Guide's Light radius (which has a hard limit) and Move+ permanently increases The Guide's movement speed.\n\nMore than anything else in the game, I didn't like the fact that your ability to generate Light is based entirely on luck. I've toyed with the idea of being able to regenerate light by being near a lantern (and the people who playtested it mentioned it too), but I couldn't get it implemented in a way in which it doesn't break the balance of the game. \n\nHints and Tips:\n- Don't pick up too many Speed+ powerups! More control is often needed.\n- Use the Lanterns to your advantage. Although they're not the best shield, they'll do in a pinch if you're low on Light.\n- Don't kill every Flyer you see. They always release a Red Bullet when they die. Sometimes you're better off leaving them.\n- When your COMBO hits 20/40/60/..., if you're not on full ammo for your right-click weapon, you'll get 1 ammo.\n- Only use your right-click weapon when it's essential. It resets your COMBO and significantly hinders your score.\n\nLet me know what you think of it and what score you get, my highest is 122460!\n\nTools used:\nGame Maker\nbfxr","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/86c390bbb087ea61777f357512fa85bd.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=4068","author":{"name":"Nihilate","uid":4068,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/99fbaba04bcab460f3af699cf8fdb16a?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/nihilate/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4068-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4068-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4068-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4068-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4068-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4068-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4068-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4068-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4068-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4068-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?n5az07z75dz085u"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?adaz3ad32sadsid"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":47,"score":3.73},{"area":"fun","rank":49,"score":3.47},{"area":"overall","rank":67,"score":3.5},{"area":"graphics","rank":105,"score":3.4},{"area":"theme","rank":122,"score":3.4},{"area":"audio","rank":215,"score":2.33},{"area":"humor","rank":318,"score":1.57},{"area":"coolness","rank":418,"score":0},{"area":"community","rank":448,"score":1.6}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Catch and Leave","category":"compo","description":"Catch and Leave was made during 48 Hour Competition.\nIt's my first time participating to this competition.\nI don't have really finish it sorry, but hope you will find some entertainment and fun.\nI still working on it ^^.\n\nWell....\nYour are the blue one, you keep moving, but can change direction thanks to UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT arrows.

As I normally submit little games that I make in my own \"engine\" with very few tools to work with, I needed some form of middleware to handle assets.\n\nInitially, we went with Cryengine3, but currently, you can't log in with the same developer account and all level files are encrypted to the login.\n\nAfter learning that, we switched to Unity.  Neither of use had used Unity before so there was a lot of learning involved; I spent about equal time making this game as I did looking up documentation and going through tutorials.  Still, we managed to make a little game and hope to make a bigger one next time!\n\nCode/Script/Final Deployment/Crappy Particle Shower at End by Max Maroe (Drakfyre)\nParticles/Music/Sound/Game Design by Justin Moravetz\nRain sound effect found here: http://www.freesound.org/samplesViewSingle.php?id=118514\nSpecial Thanks to MasterHyjinx for hosting TWO days of barbecue for the event!\n\nEDIT: Added ports to Windows and Mac; I have not tested the Windows port but will later; let me know if it gives anyone any trouble.

Jiggawatt has generously built (another) version that seems to work for people. (Clearly, I need to get better at using cxfreeze/py2exe.)\n\nRed Rover is an introspective game about a robot on a scientific mission. It is a puzzle game with more than one ending.\n\nYou can choose to explore, carry out your mission, or simply contemplate the vast loneliness of being stranded on an alien planet.\n\n*** There may be more to the planet than meets the eye! :) Please explore a little bit before deciding to analyze every rock! ***\n\nCurrently requires Python2.6+ and Pygame. I hope to have an app and an exe built if I can figure out the respective tools.\n\nIf you are having trouble grabbing rocks, it helps to imagine the grabber claw in the exact center of the rover. So try to position yourself directly over the middle of the rocks (or where you want to drop the rocks). In retrospect I should have put the claw on the front (or back) to make it visible, but there just wasn't time.\n\nI have put some spoilers online here

As you explore you can find different elemental modes to aid you in escaping unscathed from the numerous monsters out to get you.\n\nKeys:\nArrow keys: movement\nEsc: Exit\n1 - raw mode (default mode. Gives you more health)\n2 - light mode (enemies notice you more, but after 5 seconds you get path finding to nearby objects of interest)\n3 - plant mode (slower movement but decreased damage from enemies and increased health regen)\n4 - lightning mode (take damage over time but damage nearby enemies)\n5 - water mode (enemies lose all friction and have worse control (doesn't work well, don't use))\n6 - shadow mode (enemies less likely to notice you, but you take more damage)\n7 - air mode (you move a lot faster, but are extremely vulnerable to damage)\n\nTested in both linux and windows. You need python2.6 (or greater but not 3.0), pygame and python_openGL to run.\n\nCan download pygame installer for windows easily, but I found for pyOpenGL I had to download setuptools and run from the command line\n\nTo run the game, just run the \"elemental_escape.py\" file.\n\nc:\\python26\\scripts\\easy_install.exe PyOpenGL PyOpenGL-accelerate\n\nKnown issues: \n-Framerate is quite low (I think due to locking inefficiencies between movement and drawing threads)\n-Water mode allows monster to go very fast due to poor drag model.\n-Sometimes you (and monsters) can cut through the walls at their ends (not a big deal but not perfect)\n- breadth first search for path-finding (light mode) is inefficient. Maximum path-size is probably a good idea so the light-mode only checks for nearby items.\n\nToDo:\n- Text to the screen for detailing keys to use, powers from the modes, that you've won the game, or lost the game, etc.\n- Better graphics (including animations), sound.\n- More than one kind of enemy, more interesting escape from them.\n\nTips on playing the game:\n- Monsters are less agile than you are. If you quickly dodge them effectively they can't find you.\n- You always start in the bottom-left of the maze, and the exit is always at the top-right of the maze.\n\nAlso just a warning: I should've said this earlier so sorry to those who put the effort in and were disappointed. I did this game in very little time and I'm not really very experienced in game programming. The main problem is that I got it working and then didn't tweak it to be actually fun. So this game isn't really very good and I am aware of this. Only download if you're willing to try a not so good game and give it the rating it deserves.\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/3cdd76a1adf39d204c28fd527a087da3.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=236","author":{"name":"triorph","uid":236,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e9034f3b1d9a2a66c508a6ab0c33bc45?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/triorph/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/236-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/236-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"All OSs (tested in both windows and linux)","url":"http://miek.dyndns-home.com/ludumdare/elemental_escape.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://miek.dyndns-home.com/ludumdare/elemental_escape"}],"ratings":[{"area":"audio","rank":371,"score":1},{"area":"coolness","rank":418,"score":0},{"area":"humor","rank":466,"score":1},{"area":"graphics","rank":487,"score":1.29},{"area":"fun","rank":495,"score":1.29},{"area":"theme","rank":496,"score":1.43},{"area":"overall","rank":499,"score":1.29},{"area":"innovation","rank":499,"score":1.29},{"area":"community","rank":529,"score":1}],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Escape from the Frame","category":"compo","description":"Done in 48 hours.

I implemented a dialogue system, but never ended up getting to use it :( But I will definitely build on this game!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/fa9dfffa559b024e0ac414d0d4419d7f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=4069","author":{"name":"PaperCutDoom","uid":4069,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/791c073c02588f775e35a26f36c35980?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/papercutdoom/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4069-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4069-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4069-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4069-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4069-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4069-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4069-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4069-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4069-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4069-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17256312/ImpossibleEscape.zip"},{"label":"Windows (after compo)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17256312/ImpossibleEscapePost.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17256312/ImpossibleEscapeSource.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":71,"score":3.3},{"area":"audio","rank":74,"score":3.25},{"area":"humor","rank":205,"score":2},{"area":"theme","rank":220,"score":3.08},{"area":"fun","rank":225,"score":2.75},{"area":"overall","rank":227,"score":2.92},{"area":"coolness","rank":246,"score":2},{"area":"innovation","rank":256,"score":2.75},{"area":"graphics","rank":259,"score":2.67}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Lasertrap","category":"compo","description":"You are Bob, a guy who somehow ended up imprisoned and is guarded only by lasers.\n\nGood luck!\n\nRequires XNA (http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=20914)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/6c335e92d75c3358514a4ea15399ba4b.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=5490","author":{"name":"MadrMan","uid":5490,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bb043827e5f1b3a79bb67e127ee4f41b?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/madrman/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5490-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5490-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5490-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5490-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5490-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5490-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/314911/Lasertrap.rar"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/314911/Lasertrap-src.rar"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":144,"score":4},{"area":"theme","rank":190,"score":3.17},{"area":"audio","rank":229,"score":2.25},{"area":"overall","rank":290,"score":2.75},{"area":"innovation","rank":292,"score":2.58},{"area":"fun","rank":313,"score":2.42},{"area":"humor","rank":335,"score":1.5},{"area":"graphics","rank":347,"score":2.33},{"area":"community","rank":467,"score":1.5}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Mazes & Demons","category":"compo","description":"You wake up not knowing where you are.

In the game, you star as a lowly laboratory mouse who wants to escape the clutches of the evil Professor Kitty von Doom.  \n\nThe professor has invented a top secret formula called Bounce-onium that he has given to the mouse in his lab which makes any animal able to bounce like a ball! Using his new powers, the mouse decides to make an escape attempt.  \n\nUse the arrow keys (or A and D) to give the \"mouse\" (ball) some English - like tilting the table.  Try to grab the red security key-card and then touch the red door labelled \"authorized staff only\" to make a break for it!\n\nProgrammed using HTML5 in javascript. Uses box2dweb and soundmanager2. Sound effects created by BSFXR. All art was drawn by hand using paper and markers, scanned and tinted in Photoshop.\n\nThis game runs at 480x800 resolution because it is designed to work on smartphones.  It runs wonderfully on my Android HTC Desire Z phone, for example.  If you have a non-HD (low resolution) monitor it will be too big to fit.  For example, it definitely won't fit on older netbook screens which only have 600 pixels of height.  I hope to make a smaller version for the people who still have low def screens.  Might just produce a half-size version.\n\nCurrently does not work in IE.  What a huge surprise.

Abbot, though that wasn't really my intention going in.\n\nMy intention, instead, was to use the Facebook API and social network to create an asynchonous co-operative experience, where players worked together to complete the game and the story.\n\nI've done this to the extent that the game is quite possibly impossible to finish alone, and still very hard to finish when working with others (note: the social aspect is hidden at first, but becomes consequential once you get to the later levels, and hopefully will become apparent).\n\nThis is pretty much an experiment, partly in story and partly in social media. I'd love to hear your takes on it.\n\n(please note that for the social aspect to work at all, it requires you and one of your facebook friends to play.

However, I had ideas for the three top-rated themes, and I knew I'd be spending three hours on a train, during which time I might as well be making games, so I decided to have a go at making a game for Ludum Dare on an extra-short schedule.\n\nIn the end I managed to spend about five hours on this game, but it wasn't really enough. It's a bullet hell game, but I didn't write code that's flexible enough to generate sufficiently interesting patterns. I had intended them to be fairly simple to fit the time constraint, but not this simple.\n\nSince I'm not convinced this sloppy pile of code has any real potential, I haven't bothered to write scoring code or code to detect collisions against the player. It just loops endlessly without any possibility to win or lose, although it's moderately satisfying to shoot the Thargoids for a while.\n\nFor five hours I'm reasonably satisfied, but sorry it's no fun!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e5740c29fde9bc0a9f999e83d6e040e6.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=2445","author":{"name":"Dan C","uid":2445,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/241fa4a7d249501f84ad0a6e4b9c2ae4?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/djcsdy/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/2445-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/2445-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Play Online","url":"http://www.danielcassidy.me.uk/games/flight-of-the-cobra-ld.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/djcsdy/flight-of-the-cobra"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":336,"score":2},{"area":"audio","rank":371,"score":1},{"area":"graphics","rank":375,"score":2.2},{"area":"fun","rank":407,"score":2},{"area":"coolness","rank":418,"score":0},{"area":"humor","rank":441,"score":1.14},{"area":"innovation","rank":450,"score":1.82},{"area":"overall","rank":474,"score":1.77},{"area":"theme","rank":491,"score":1.6}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Fred the Astro-Miner","category":"compo","description":"UPDATE: I've posted a link to some shaders that use GLSL 1.4 and have the GL_ARB_texture_rectangle extension declared.

Your mission is to guide him through the everchanging network of duckboards, collect the Wisplings he needs to reactivate the Seal he came through and take one step closer to the home. To be honest though, the level are procedurally generated and the difficulty increases indefinitely, so the road is quite long. Maybe we need a sequel to relieve the Wisp from his torment?\n\nControls are explained in-game, but we forgot a couple of details in the rush: You can skip to the opposite side of the maze by moving the Wisp outside the screen, providing that the block on the other side is accessible. Also if you stay still for a moment, the platforms directly under you will move. This is meant to prevent getting stuck so easily. The game can also be played with Xbox 360 controller if you have one hanging around.\n\nSpiritual was made by Team Jolly Roger for 21st Ludum Dare, using XNA Game Studio 4.0.

Red. Mr. Green is caught while attempting to infiltrate a building and needs your help getting out by unlocking and locking the doors in the complex. Try to trap the red guard units into spare rooms, so mr. Green has a clean passage.\n\nRunning the game:\nWindows users: use 'run.bat' to start the game (this will set the necessary environment variables)\nLinux and Mac OSX: You need Python 2.7 with the pyglet library to run this game. Execute 'python main.py' to start the game.\n\nControls:\nYour main control system is the terminal on the left of the screen. There you can enter commands to manipulate the systems on the network. Type 'help' at any time to find out the commands that are at your disposal. On the right is the blueprint of the current level. Mr. Green is indicated as a green dot. Enemy guard units are indicated with red.\n\nAs soon as enough information is available, mr. Green will plot out his intended route to his destination. You can guide him by opening and closing doors.\n\nTutorial:\nEnter the 'relays' command to discover all doors on the current level. The blueprint will show the door code names. Perform a 'scan' to get a hint which systems are on the network. You can 'connect' to each system using either its ip address or its canonical name. Doors can be 'locked' and 'unlocked', either allowing or preventing mr. Green to pass them.\n\nKnown bugs:\nSadly, some bugs make this game quite uninteresting. \n- The guards are really not that observant, so most of the time you can just run them over without them ever noticing you.\n- Another bug is in the third level, where the level switch event is not triggered.\n- Sometimes (observed in the second level), a guard will just run through a closed door.\n\nIn-game story (not fleshed out in game, due to time constraints):\nYou always knew something was off with this last job. Maybe it was the jittery behaviour of your contact or the fact that there was virtually no information available on the target. The pay was also substantially bigger than usual. Anyway, when mr. Green (a codename, of course) handed back the intel folder, you could not believe your ears when he told you he was in. Ordinarily, it was him that turned down potentially risky jobs. After all, it was his life on the line when the job went south. You were always safe, far away from the action. Well, if mr. Green wants to take the risk, you're game.\n\nThe first door was easy. The guard units were milling around, not really paying any attention to the intruder. Then again, the scramble software always did its job properly.\n...\nMr. Green: See? Nothing to it. Just an easy snatch and grab.\nMr. Red: It still does not sit right with me. Have you any idea what this company does or what we are stealing?\nMr. Green: No, I am only interested in remembering the building blueprints and the briefcase on LVL2.\nMr. Red: Just be quick about it. I want to be out of here rather sooner than later.\nMr. Green: Gee, what do your think ab...\nAnnouncer: Warning! Security has been breached! Warning! Deploying security drones.\nMr. Green: What are you doing!?!\nAnnouncer: Security drones deployed. Please lie facedown on the ground with your arms on your head. The drones will shoot any attempt at fleeing.\nMr. Green: You son-\n\nIt happended before you could react. The room mr. Green just stept in suddenly disappeared from the system. No camera feeds, no door controls, nothing. You try to reconnect with mr. Green, but no luck. His signal is dead. Your scans of the network yield no results. For almost an hour the network was dark.\n\nAn hour later, the system went back online, just as it was before the break in attempt. Shortly there after, mr. Greens signal came back.\n\nMr. Green: Red, come in!\nMr. Red: This is Red. Where are you?\nMr. Green: On the third level of the complex. They have some weird cell complex here. I think I am the only one here, but the guard units are buzzing around frantically.\nMr. Red: I am pulling up the schematics of the system. I am going to get you out. Hold tight!\nMr. Green: Hurry, will ya? I do not want to find out why all these cells are here.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c740771eb2f933e56c41532c14056e36.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=4422","author":{"name":"ghostonline","uid":4422,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ea7ccb0cd2ab61c9863b216c7726788d?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/ghostonline/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4422-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4422-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1760333/ld21-win32.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1760333/ld21-source.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1760333/ld21-source.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1760333/ld21-source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":9,"score":4.2},{"area":"theme","rank":184,"score":3.2},{"area":"community","rank":234,"score":2.56},{"area":"overall","rank":250,"score":2.87},{"area":"fun","rank":292,"score":2.47},{"area":"coolness","rank":311,"score":1},{"area":"graphics","rank":313,"score":2.47},{"area":"audio","rank":371,"score":1},{"area":"humor","rank":389,"score":1.33}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"the dream forest","category":"compo","description":"this short abstract exploration game is my first LD entry. i spent most of my time making sprites and music so there is not really much gameplay. there is a lot of atmosphere however. :) a playthrough will only take about five minutes.\n\ncontrols:\nLEFT, RIGHT - go left and right\nUP - use umbrella\nR - if limping around the forest is not your style (or you just don't like the anim), press this to engage beast mode\n\ni developed the game with the love2d library, so it works on windows, mac, and linux. i've only included a standalone version for windows though; if you want to play it on another platform, download love from http://love2d.org/ and grab the .love file. the source is also in the .love file--just change the extension from .love to .zip and you can open it up to get at the lua files inside.\n\ni had some more grandiose plans for this game but i ran out of time so i had to keep it pretty simple. if time permits, i'd like to do a bit more with it in the future.\n\nupdate: timelapse added!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/2b6e961982af0f2e824ce5c41f705b0f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=4975","author":{"name":"mes","uid":4975,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2821f70beac7d29a245fa6887382dff2?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/mes/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4975-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4975-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4975-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4975-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4975-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4975-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4975-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4975-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows Standalone","url":"http://queklain.undev.org/ld21/dreamforest0.zip"},{"label":"Cross-platform + Source (.love)","url":"http://queklain.undev.org/ld21/dreamforest0.love"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u98UnCVB4Y"}],"ratings":[{"area":"audio","rank":3,"score":4.33},{"area":"overall","rank":17,"score":3.83},{"area":"graphics","rank":25,"score":4.11},{"area":"coolness","rank":144,"score":4},{"area":"community","rank":173,"score":2.85},{"area":"fun","rank":181,"score":2.88},{"area":"innovation","rank":182,"score":3.06},{"area":"theme","rank":230,"score":3},{"area":"humor","rank":323,"score":1.56}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"The Remnants","category":"jam","description":"Perhaps bit off a bit more than I could chew, but this is a challenge after all.\nThe idea is a BattleStar Galactica Sim; aliens have destroyed your civilization and you have to escape their fleets that are hunting you around the galaxy.\nThat's the idea at any rate, at this point it's still extraordinarily bare-bones. So, I'm not expecting high ratings (don't be too mean tho!) instead I just wanted to get something in so I could point to it and say, \"I did that!\".\n\nUPDATE: Yes, I'm aware that I neglected to tell anyone what is supposed to happen in this game; I had meant to post an update with some fixes but day_job() has been running somewhat constantly. So here's a brief rundown on what is happening.\nThe red dots are planets. Move along, nothing to see here, yet.\nThe Blue dots are enemy fleets. Don't worry, they don't attack you right now..\nThe green dot is your fleet. You can't see it, but there's 41 ships in there, and they all consume food, water and fuel each time you \"jump\". You jump by clicking a spot in space that's within jump range of the fleet (yeah, I know, can't see it right?) and then hit end of turn.\nWoo, tonnes of fun right? Yeah, it's a prototype, not really a game, but I like the idea so PostCompo revs might have some interesting revisions.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/12f451592405fcf848b1e65ff8231e6f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=1643","author":{"name":"CoffeeOnimal","uid":1643,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ccdf9bf6a90669ff7e62f18b1e6190b6?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/coffeeonimal/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/1643-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/1643-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9021693/CoffeeHouseOnimal-LD4821Escape.swf"}],"ratings":[{"area":"audio","rank":70,"score":1},{"area":"humor","rank":77,"score":1},{"area":"innovation","rank":83,"score":1.5},{"area":"theme","rank":86,"score":1.3},{"area":"overall","rank":89,"score":1.18},{"area":"fun","rank":89,"score":1},{"area":"graphics","rank":89,"score":1.09},{"area":"coolness","rank":311,"score":1},{"area":"community","rank":513,"score":1.17}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"TREASURES","category":"compo","description":"Hey everyone, it's pythong!\nI really have to say, I needed this.

Go play! :)\n\nThe concept of the game is that the protagonist is locked in her nightmares and needs to find a path out. Simple as that. It contains 16 puzzle levels, should take maybe 30 minutes to solve them all.\n\nThe game looks quite bad in the screenshots, but I'm pretty happy how it looks \"live\" once it's animated. Also, the whole atmosphere I think is what went well this time.\n\nOn the gameplay side itself, it turned out to be a really easy game, and I had a hard time building puzzles that aren't obvious. And I'm not at all happy with monster gameplay. It would be interesting to know if some better level designer could pull better levels out of the mechanics. So all in all, the gameplay side this time is a bit of a dissapointment. \n\nOverall I'm happy with what I came up with this time, considering I had such a hard time with it on the first day. Happily it all came together on the second day (altough the game is no where near what the original concept was).\n\nProgrammed with Flash Develop, graphics drawn in Photoshop with Wacom and sounds done with Audacity + microphone + sample library.\n\nSource is a bit of a mess, but it's available if anyone cares.\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/9c77d010aa0271e6ecccde23decbbccf.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=78","author":{"name":"gimblll","uid":78,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/219dfc5d83bdc7b28a3c75585613b1ea?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/gimblll/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/78-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/78-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.kongregate.com/games/gimblll/dream-path"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.kongregate.com/games/gimblll/dream-path"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/22232011/dream_path/dream_path_src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"audio","rank":44,"score":3.5},{"area":"graphics","rank":53,"score":3.79},{"area":"overall","rank":73,"score":3.47},{"area":"innovation","rank":80,"score":3.53},{"area":"fun","rank":118,"score":3.11},{"area":"community","rank":157,"score":2.89},{"area":"theme","rank":194,"score":3.16},{"area":"coolness","rank":246,"score":2},{"area":"humor","rank":389,"score":1.33}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Escape from Leong Mansion","category":"compo","description":"Phew, it's been a long weekend.

If you get a blank page after clicking the game link, refresh the page and it should be fine.\n\nI made a couple entries on my blog (linked above) while the LD site was down (in addition to a couple entries here).\n\nAs always, I wanted to do something way outside of how I thought most people would interpret the theme.  I ended up doing something very different than anything I've done before.\n\nI went with the idea of psychological escape mechanisms, and avoiding difficult or painful thoughts.  The game (more of a playable story) has the player feeding the difficult thoughts to Anthony, a man tormented by painful memories.  The player must persist with the thought until Anthony accepts and comes to terms with it.\n\nI discovered that conveying a meaningful story through a first-person thought fragment narrative was very difficult.  I spent several hours developing a story, and ended up scrapping it and creating a much shorter, more workable one (that went in a very different direction) in the last couple hours.  The final result came together at the end.\n\nI created the game in the Flex 4 framework (with Flashdevelop) and Flashpunk.  The one piece of \"art\" was created in Photoshop, and the music in Reason.\n\nI kept the story pretty short, so it shouldn't take more than a couple minutes to play through it.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e21712743fb011e64bed29140a29861d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=2355","author":{"name":"Martoon","uid":2355,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/18f35312045225343dd73d289bcef464?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/martoon/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/2355-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/2355-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.levitygames.com/vault/escape/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.levitygames.com/vault/escape/EscapeMech.zip"},{"label":"Blog","url":"http://www.levitygames.com/"},{"label":"Journal (link below isn't working)","url":"http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/category/ld-21/?author_name=martoon"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":50,"score":3.7},{"area":"theme","rank":68,"score":3.63},{"area":"audio","rank":69,"score":3.3},{"area":"community","rank":122,"score":3},{"area":"coolness","rank":144,"score":4},{"area":"overall","rank":149,"score":3.19},{"area":"fun","rank":330,"score":2.35},{"area":"graphics","rank":400,"score":2},{"area":"humor","rank":426,"score":1.21}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Bomber Planet","category":"compo","description":"Bomber Planet is a copyright-groping mashup of The Legend of Zelda, Bomberman, Metroid, possibly the Soviet national anthem, and apparently Pokemon.

Space to Jump. Space to release from crane. Didn't have time to put in \"restart key\" so if you get stuck you'll have to restart the app.\n\nScratchy Get Out! is an arcade game where you \"Scratchy\" have to figure out how to escape from the room. I kind of molded it in after classic arcade games like Mario Bros.\n\nI should point out this is as much a puzzle game as it is an arcade game. It is pretty tricky but it is solvable. You will definitely have to use your brain to escape the room. You have to pick up items, operate machinery, etc to win.\n\nWARNING:\nThe feedback coming in is that the game is way too hard. The level that I managed to build would normally be like the last level of a 20 level game. It has everything thrown in it and I made it as hard as possible. If I had had more time I could have made the tutorial levels necessary to make it not so frustrating for players. The one thing I really screwed up on was running out of time before I could build more levels. I had this wonderful toolbox ready and I could have easily built more levels (especially easier ones) if I had just had time. Oh well, I learned a lot with stencyl so next time my progress will be better.\n\nDue to people having so many issues with making progress, here is the walkthrough:\n\nSPOILER*******************\nJump over the growlers and get a boulder. Climb the rope and jump on the cannon. The boulder should load into the cannon (if you aren't standing on top of the cannon). Then the cannon should fire the boulder into the crane. Drop the boulder on the blue rock by controlling the crane. the rock should break if you hit it. By the way, due to a bug, always wait at least 10 seconds after loading the crane before dropping a boulder. Ok, now you have a way to get back down and get more boulders. Keep doing so and reloading the cannon and try to kill off as many of the obstacles (knifers and growlers) that you think you need to to make it easy to get more boulders. Once you feel safe, start dropping the boulders on all of the things above the exit. Once you have cleared a path to the exit, then this time load a boulder but stay on top of the boulder. This might take a few tries (you have to be on the boulder just right). But then if done correctly the boulder should shoot you up into the crane and you will be stuck in it. Now move the crane over to where the exit is and release down. You have escaped!\nEND SPOILER ***********************************\n\nUsed stencyl to program and generate flash swf. Will post more details later. Posted on Kongregate.\n\nI am continuing to develop this game. Already I have a version that adds a cool indiana jones boulder dodging level and fixes some of the annoying bugs. Right now I'm providing the new version as an SWF. The best way to play is to download the SWF file and play in fullscreen mode. This is smoother and makes it seem more like an arcade game. You can download the SwF here:\n\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/5866491/Scratchy%20Get%20Out%21.swf\n\nThere are two known bugs (that manage to make the game even harder, not easier of course):\n\n1. the \"getting high\" bug (if you get this you have to reload the game).\n\n2. the \"crumbling boulder\" bug (the workaround here is to wait 10 seconds after loading the crane with a boulder before releasing it).\n\n\nHere is a video walkthrough that might help you finish the game:\n\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/5866491/BeatScratchy/BeatScratchy.mp4\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/45e972e8f2c70a1a833108817db30e30.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=258","author":{"name":"sfernald","uid":258,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c2e95f1552dd5304e76f945cde08f8cd?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/sfernald/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/258-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/258-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.kongregate.com/games/Dogstar669/scratchy-get-out"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://www.kongregate.com/games/Dogstar669/scratchy-get-out"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://www.kongregate.com/games/Dogstar669/scratchy-get-out"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.kongregate.com/games/Dogstar669/scratchy-get-out"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5866491/Scratchy%20Get%20Out%21%20Source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":151,"score":2.91},{"area":"coolness","rank":246,"score":2},{"area":"audio","rank":271,"score":2},{"area":"graphics","rank":317,"score":2.44},{"area":"innovation","rank":382,"score":2.22},{"area":"humor","rank":389,"score":1.33},{"area":"theme","rank":425,"score":2.17},{"area":"overall","rank":440,"score":2.11},{"area":"fun","rank":441,"score":1.78}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Scriptblock's Escape LD48","category":"jam","description":"This is my first Time for LD48.\nStory:\nYou have just infiltrated a corporte building and stole Research and Development Documents.

The obvious answer is that they are abstracted away into a cage offscreen, instantaneously, in the manner of many videogames. The disobvious answer is that the Queen uses her spider-venom to shrink them down to a portable size, so she can carry them around freely, as if they were mere diamond gems.

You are set upon by all the issues that plauge your life, and must fix them without creating too many issues, or making any one issue too big.\n\nThe issues you face scroll by in the background. As they become bigger issues, they become bigger, and if any one issue becomes too much, the game will end as you are overwhelmed. Likewise if you let everything build up, you will notice that the chance of espcaping hopelessness (visualised at the bottom of the screen) will fade.\n\nIf you start to sort out your life, the issues will reduce in size, and your goal of escaping hopelessness will become clearer.\n\nIt is intended that the game is very easy to loose, and juggling all of your issues is a hard task.\n\nNote there are a few issues with the bindings, and the static versions. The best bet is to run the source version, if you can handle installing the dependancies. The Linux precompiled version will probably only work on 64-bit systems, and the Windows one may give some errors in a command prompt, and may 'crash' when you exit - but the game itself will work.\n\nOverall, I'm happy I completed the task, and I hope the game is something a little bit different. I'm no artist, so the art and (lack of) animation is not great, and I feel I could have done better, but there we go.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/3d5077dc4377d6092b0658898c1ba62d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=5642","author":{"name":"Lattyware","uid":5642,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c494fd4b406a2c066054ad17d30ae73b?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/lattyware/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5642-shot0.jpeg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5642-shot0.jpeg"}],"links":[{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.lattyware.co.uk/projects/unrest-source.tar.xz"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://www.lattyware.co.uk/projects/unrest-linux.zip"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.lattyware.co.uk/projects/unrest-win32.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":23,"score":3.92},{"area":"innovation","rank":24,"score":4},{"area":"overall","rank":114,"score":3.31},{"area":"community","rank":122,"score":3},{"area":"humor","rank":177,"score":2.13},{"area":"coolness","rank":183,"score":3},{"area":"fun","rank":217,"score":2.77},{"area":"graphics","rank":305,"score":2.5},{"area":"audio","rank":371,"score":1}],"platforms":["linux","desktop","win"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Water Escape Game","category":"jam","description":"","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c8e17ee5e4b4fa8d0ebe11e8ed614d9e.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=5111","author":{"name":"DkTyph","uid":5111,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/62dec43dc1af7316e560401ea50b3757?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/dktyph/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5111-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5111-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4522068/WaterEscapeGame/EscapeGame.swf"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4522068/WaterEscapeGame/index.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":58,"score":2.21},{"area":"fun","rank":63,"score":1.93},{"area":"overall","rank":69,"score":2.07},{"area":"theme","rank":70,"score":2.23},{"area":"graphics","rank":72,"score":2.14},{"area":"humor","rank":77,"score":1},{"area":"coolness","rank":418,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"You've Seen This in the Movies","category":"jam","description":"NOTE: I left a bug in there, you can jump once in mid-air, but only if you WALK off a platform.

Without killing yourself.\nTo detonate a bomb, you go to that square and press space to trigger the bomb - it will then fire when you leave the square.\n\nThere are three sizes of bomb - the smallest will destroy the tile they're on and set off any bombs in the surrounding squares\nthe medium size bomb will destroy adjacent squares as well, triggering any other bombs in a two-square radius.\nthe large bomb will destroy an area of 3 square radius (triggering secondary explosions in any other bombs in the 4 square radius circle)\n\nComplicating matters, there are other types of tile\n\"Fragile\" tiles can only be stepped on once and will disintegrate when you leave them.\n\"Ice\" tiles, on which you cannot stop - if you enter a patch of ice tiles you'll skid all the way to the other end.\n\"slot\" tiles, which allow you to move the bombs to other adjacent slotted tiles. (To do this, press \"p\" to pick up or drop the bomb).\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nBombusaXX was developed in c++ with Visual studio Express 10. Though I reused some window-and-opengl setup code from other projects of mine, there was no framework involved beyond that.\n\nGraphics are done in the Gimp.\n\nDidn't get around to doing sound..

You have no guns that you can fire but you do get to help out the team by dropping turrets to help with killing enemies, and health packs to regenerate health. \n\nThe more people you rescue and bring back to your base, the more money you get for equipment and upgrades.\n\nCONTROLS:\n- Control Arrows for movement\n- Z for buying and picking up items\n\nSOME NOTES:\n- For this game I concentrated on the gameplay and less on graphics and sound.\n- Didn't have time to include an endgame. Basically just try to get the most number of kills and saves\n\nSOME TIPS:\n- Flinging really helps\n- Try to set up a camp with turrets, soldiers and medpack and see your score and money rise","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a943ba6776a87fc37ef728f9b04d5230.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=5728","author":{"name":"accidentalrebel","uid":5728,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/78aaa3552735775df8790def2e08e351?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/accidentalrebel/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5728-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5728-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5728-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5728-shot1.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5728-shot2.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5728-shot2.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5728-shot3.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5728-shot3.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web ( Flash )","url":"http://www.accidentalrebel.com/rescue-support-ludumdare-21-entry/"},{"label":"Video Playthrough","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvMJYaJ_DJ0"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2122500/ld21-escape-entry.rar"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":44,"score":3.43},{"area":"fun","rank":74,"score":3.3},{"area":"innovation","rank":83,"score":3.52},{"area":"theme","rank":132,"score":3.36},{"area":"overall","rank":153,"score":3.17},{"area":"audio","rank":182,"score":2.5},{"area":"coolness","rank":183,"score":3},{"area":"graphics","rank":186,"score":3.05},{"area":"humor","rank":205,"score":2}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Something embarrassingly bad","category":"compo","description":"This is really just a proof of concept that something like this could be done in SVG + Javascript (apparently it can), but it might briefly entertain a certain kind of person.\n\nLonger-term it's supposed to be a logic puzzle game, which may explain why most of the development time was taken up getting side-tracked and solving logic puzzles and drafting terrible stories to go in the left-hand panel.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/765f157e8996803cee9bc40b42f4b3f6.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=5068","author":{"name":"madmaw","uid":5068,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fd0474e936e240fa0593d228774aeeca?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/madmaw/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5068-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5068-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://madmaw.com/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://madmaw.com/room_tower_intro.svg"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":98,"score":3.45},{"area":"community","rank":239,"score":2.5},{"area":"coolness","rank":311,"score":1},{"area":"humor","rank":335,"score":1.5},{"area":"audio","rank":371,"score":1},{"area":"graphics","rank":482,"score":1.36},{"area":"fun","rank":487,"score":1.36},{"area":"theme","rank":488,"score":1.7},{"area":"overall","rank":489,"score":1.58}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Super Kommandant Exteme","category":"compo","description":"Super Kommandant Extreme is based around two main ideas, Light as a limited resource and Hogan's Heroes perspective on prison camp Kommandants, the idea being that while people were off fighting in the war the kommandants stayed home and lived the life of the party.

So let's name it an \"avoid them all\" game. \n\nThe more you avoid bullets, the more you score. Each bullet that goes out of the screen makes you earn 1 point. \nYour score fulfil a power gauge which allow you to active one of your 4 powers : \n\n1- Shield: glass shields block the bullets\n2- Nova: generate a nova circle around your ship and destroy all the bullets in it\n3- Mirror ball: makes the entire screen go BOOM and empty it\n4- Score x2: all bullets that go out of the screen make you earn 2 points !\n\nThe idea behind the game is not just to \"escape\" the bullets. It is to \"escape\" reality. Firstly through the universe of the game and secondly because in the real world you will never just avoid the bullets without shooting.\n\nAs you will see the game needs some improvements, balancing and lack from real musics and SFX. But don't worry ! This is just the first version. Updates will come soon :)\n\nWe hope you'll like the game in this first release. Do not hesitate to drop a word, feedback, comments, anything will be appreciate. See you for another Jam :) \n\nGameplay video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze7iF8JWjUs","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/beb8d3227b6746b308f22943c76c8005.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=2855","author":{"name":"Shifty","uid":2855,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a2d7e766891777a2176743944654de45?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/shifty/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/2855-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/2855-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/2855-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/2855-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/2855-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/2855-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/2855-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/2855-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/2855-shot4.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/2855-shot4.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.shiftyweb.net/LD48/Pastagus_Fantasy-r1.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"humor","rank":8,"score":3.18},{"area":"graphics","rank":14,"score":3.92},{"area":"audio","rank":24,"score":3},{"area":"overall","rank":30,"score":2.92},{"area":"fun","rank":33,"score":2.54},{"area":"innovation","rank":49,"score":2.38},{"area":"theme","rank":66,"score":2.31},{"area":"community","rank":122,"score":3},{"area":"coolness","rank":418,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Quean Bee","category":"jam","description":"My first game jam, and I heeded the wisdom of McFunkypants regarding the avoidance of noob mistakes, going with something very simple.\n\nA 2-player game: get your lovely bees across to the other side of the screen, but stop the other player from getting their bees across.

All you know is that you need to escape.\n\nThere is a post-compo update that fixes some major bugs. Here's the list of changes from 1.00 to 1.03:\n\n-Added a few tiles to some rooms to make them slightly less dull.\n-Fixed a music bug with the red terminal (for real this time)\n-Added a secret 4th Boomka game you can unlock after beating the red terminal.\n-Added a \"portal\" object to a single room. It's related to the secret.\n-Made it so that checkpoints remember what key cards and doors are open when you save (as well as other variables, such as the music playing). This prevents you from grabbing a keycard, getting killed, but keeping the keycard after respawning.\n-Added sounds for the fireballs.\n-Randomized the fireball-pipe's first alarm a tiny bit.\n-Fireballs now destroy when they fall off the edge of the screen.\n-Made it so that using a terminal will reset the \"used\" status of checkpoints, so you can save again if you've just played a Boomka game.\n-Removed a couple of very frustrating spikes.\n-Moved around and added a couple of turrets, as well as some fireball-pipes.\n-Closed one of the exits early in the game, past a blue door. Turns out I never added a room past there. Silly me. :p\n-Refined the controls a bit. Feels a lot less slippery.\n-Added version number to the opening.\n-Fixed a few broken tiles\n-Added simple particle effects for sparks and blood.\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/21f41d331bdaafab94132911d2436517.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=1554","author":{"name":"NateNaterson","uid":1554,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8ceb4811f539ed4f7f6e9c3c9dfa9e1c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/natenaterson/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/1554-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/1554-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/1554-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/1554-shot1.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/1554-shot2.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/1554-shot2.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows - Compo Version (1.00)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13900535/Captive.rar"},{"label":"Windows - Current Version (1.03)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13900535/Captive%201.03.rar"},{"label":"Source (Game Maker 8.0)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13900535/Captive%20Source.rar"}],"ratings":[{"area":"overall","rank":22,"score":3.8},{"area":"fun","rank":22,"score":3.67},{"area":"theme","rank":49,"score":3.73},{"area":"audio","rank":60,"score":3.38},{"area":"humor","rank":143,"score":2.27},{"area":"graphics","rank":211,"score":2.87},{"area":"innovation","rank":238,"score":2.8},{"area":"community","rank":273,"score":2.33},{"area":"coolness","rank":311,"score":1}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Carol and The Haunted Castle","category":"compo","description":"Made using:\n\nCoding:\nGame Maker 8.1\n\nMusic and sounds:\nGuitar Pro\nChordPulse\nMixcraft\n\nGraphics:\nCharas Project\nPaint (Win7)\nPaint.net\n\n\nPlot: \"Help Carol to escape from the Haunted Castle\"\n\nI didn't have enough time to create more rooms, puzzles or songs, but I'm almost satisfied with the 2.5D coding and the look and feel of the game.\n\nThe main \"song\" (actually a couple of chords) was made using Guitar Pro, hope you like it.\n\nHope you like the game too... use arrows to move and space to jump :) ...

If you still get problems please say so in comments. Since I can only have 5 links I removed the HiDef download link of the old build.\nYou can still download it here: Windows - HiDef http://www.mediafire.com/?hybb4pjxib9wpxs\n\nDare To Escape is a bullet-hell platformer.\n\nYou need XNA/.NET 4 to play the game.\nI am sorry for this! Never had to distribute an XNA game before. Thought they would work out of the box.\n\nIt's my first time participating in LD and the first \"serious\" game I did by myself.\n\nSadly there is not much content due to huge time problems.\nIn exchange the difficulty curve is insane in the two levels it has.\n\nIf the HiDef-version doesnt work for you, try out the Reach-version! If the Reach version doesn't work pls specify the error you get.\n\nI didn't include the uncompressed audio files in the source as they take 300mb of space. If you want to compile it you have to remove all occurences where the AudioManager or AudioHelper is used.\n\nThe music was generated using http://tones.wolfram.com/generate/ . I hope this is allowed seeing how programs such as bfxr are allowed to generate sound effects.\n\nThere is currently a bug in that bosses sometimes dont spawn if you play the game in one session. If you find a blue orb without there being a boss you should restart the game. You can use the resume feature afterwards to start at your last checkpoint and the boss should be there this time (if you didnt save after picking up the blue orb).\n\nI might expand upon this game in the future.

Due to the way it's coded, bullets are only destroyed when they exit the screen or hit an enemy. Firing loads of bullets can lag the game. Fire in single or double bursts for best gameplay - as few bullets as possible at a time.\n \n2. Bullets have faster speeds when you fire with the cursor more towards the edge of the game field - to avoid the bullet clean-up problem mentioned in number (1), try to fire as far out as possible (again, in single or double bursts).\n\n3. Also due to the coding, only the most recent bullet fired will have collision. This can cause problems in clean-up (for example creating a bullet shield at slow speed means those bullets will not be cleaned up as they will not get to the edge of the screen or hit an enemy) and may confuse gameplay. For the best advice, I'd say that sticking to single or double shots will help in all cases (again). \n\nTL;DR:\n\nFire as few bullets as possible, aiming as close to the edge of the screen (or the enemy you wish to kill) as possible, to get best performance and (hopefully) enjoyment. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease do feed back. It's a .jar file so feel free to download whichever \"platform\" you like. \n\nI hope you enjoy the game. \n\n- Jonno","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b60f792eae362e2ef94e834280d8adf9.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=4856","author":{"name":"jonnopon3000","uid":4856,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/81492b6be78eb0eb74399dd119a213f8?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/jonnopon3000/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4856-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4856-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4856-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4856-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4856-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4856-shot2.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4856-shot3.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4856-shot3.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4856-shot4.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/4856-shot4.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/38489921/LD%20%2321%20Sub/Starfire%20Game/Starfire.jar"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/38489921/LD%20%2321%20Sub/Starfire%20Game/Starfire.jar"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/38489921/LD%20%2321%20Sub/Starfire%20Game/Starfire.jar"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/38489921/LD%20%2321%20Sub/Starfire%20Source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":34,"score":3.53},{"area":"coolness","rank":87,"score":6},{"area":"humor","rank":185,"score":2.12},{"area":"audio","rank":251,"score":2.15},{"area":"fun","rank":396,"score":2.1},{"area":"overall","rank":413,"score":2.27},{"area":"graphics","rank":416,"score":1.93},{"area":"theme","rank":419,"score":2.24},{"area":"innovation","rank":440,"score":1.9}],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Castle Escape","category":"compo","description":"You are a villainous dragon, known far and wide for your evil heart and taste for fair maidens.

Far from my first LD but things did not go so smoothly. Had some other things to do these two days but still managed to sit some 20 hours behind computer.\nSadly only something like 10 were productive.\n\nSo, theme was too broad for my taste so I just started working on something I wanted to try for a while, to make a 2D Toribash like ragdoll toy. And I did. Had bunch of ideas how to make it in to an escape game afterwards. In the end went with zero gravity escape as with gravity its probably even more complex to control it then in Toribash lol :D\n\nUsed Flash and Box2D . No time and motivation left to do graphics and sounds so pure code only ;/ But it has its own charm, will work more on graphics later :) \n\n<Rant alert>\n So it was my worst LD ever ;( Firstly got stuck with some angle calculations(well usual stuff) but then... \n- Then my mouse broke ;( \n- Then second mouse broke in same way which made me wonder if it is my notebook?!?! \n- So I was finishing it in frustration with broken mouse and a touch pad. Considering that mouse is main input method here it was horrible. \n- So those 10 hours of trying to figure out what happened with mouse and trying to achieve at least something with touchpad were hours reserved for sounds, graphics and normal level went in to ;/\n- Anyways it seems it is biggest LudumDare yet, so I was stuck trying to upload at 4Am until my own internet went down completely 0_o, just to add to problems and frustrations. So its actually good that submission was extended 12 hours because of site problems :)\n</Rand alert>\n\nSo, some strong speech and frustration for me here, but ah well, at least played with things I wanted :D Hope when frustration will goes away will experiment with this more. It should be a fun template for various types of games. \n\nUpdate:\nAdded a video to YouTube with me passing this game http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvdpZ4PiAO0 hope it will help people who never played Toribash to figure some things out, few advices:\n- Use space to pause the game and issue many commands at once\n- Remember about center of mass when you try to push\n- Relaxed parts absorb shocks, stiff ones bounce, so its a good idea to be relaxed when you don't want to bounce, or stiff all parts when you want to push with maximal force\n- And it is space, if you are flying in right direction just relax and wait, no need to go crazy and ruin your right direction :)\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/68b6df5bd8e41d46a27df33d37eafcb2.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=232","author":{"name":"wonderwhy-er","uid":232,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/65a0187ab622c5b0762580622e43898d?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/wonderwhy-er/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/232-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/232-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.wonderwhy-er.com/ld21/ZeroGravityEscape.exe"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.wonderwhy-er.com/ld21/ZeroGravityEscape.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.wonderwhy-er.com/ld21/LudumDare21.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":50,"score":3.7},{"area":"coolness","rank":115,"score":5},{"area":"humor","rank":205,"score":2},{"area":"community","rank":273,"score":2.33},{"area":"overall","rank":364,"score":2.53},{"area":"theme","rank":365,"score":2.47},{"area":"audio","rank":371,"score":1},{"area":"fun","rank":378,"score":2.16},{"area":"graphics","rank":420,"score":1.89}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"ZOMBEE FLOOD","category":"compo","description":"Unfortunately, game is not 100% complete..

This being my first Ludum Dare, I wanted to do something excessively simple and arcadey. The game has 3 modes: Standard, where you simply type out a really silly story. The full text of what you have to type is displayed along the bottom. Along the top is your text entry box and the word you should type next. The second mode is called \"Nyan mode\" where you just type nyan over an over again until you become sick of it (or make 4 mistakes). The third mode is the one that most resembles an actual game, it's called Fish mode.

In order to escape from Castle Puzzlestein you will have to use your brains instead of your brawns. Unlike the guards in the more well-known caste, the gauards here are quite slow. They will move only when you move. They will however try to catch you if they get a glimse of you.\n\nPlan you actions ahead. At the far right of the screen is a palette with your available actions. Next to the palette is a container for your queue of actions. Either click these actions to add them to the queue or drag them in. The order of actions can also be rearranged. Remove actions by using the right mouse button.\n\nWhen you are satisified with your selection, you may start playback of the queue by using the playback buttons at the bottom. This will play each action in the queue in sequence. If a guard catches you, the playback will stop.\n\nYour ultimate goal is to reach the exit from each level. Good luck.\n\nUPDATE:\nI've added an updated version of the game, fixing some of the problems with the competition version. Please don't vote based on this version.

It's an action-puzzler about speed, precision, space, and color. A Blob creature, known as Bloopie, makes its escape from a Gnomish prison. There are 27 short levels in this frantic tetris-meets-frogger arcade.\n\nThe idea is to dodge globular bullets coming at you from all sides as you make your way to the top of the level. If you are hit, the glob attach to Bloopie, becoming an extension of its body. So just don't get hit right? Not so simple... Blocking your path are laser force field gates which must be disarmed by sacrificing an exposed glob of matching color from Bloopie's body. Don't have the right color handy? Just absorb it from the bullets. But here's where it gets fun--the glob bullets are initially all grey. An absorbed glob adopts the color of the floor tile where it was absorbed! Pay heed to next color you'll need... and get the bullet in the right spot! Stay thin or get stuck and crushed in the stone gateway exit.\n\nWhat I used to make this game:\nA netbook.\nFlash Develop\nFlex compiler\nFlixel 2.55\nA desktop with crash-a-lot hardware (for music/graphics).\nPxtone (ptVoice and ptCollage)\n\nNow a few notes on my first experience with Ludum Dare:\nI've been wanting to compete in ld48 or the jam for a few years now, but haven't had the time. I wasn't really prepared for this one either... I just stumbled here in the first several hours of competition and decided to join in. I'm so glad I did--it was a blast!\n\nUnfortunately my first game could not be polished as well as I would have liked before presenting it. There are some bugs, although the whole thing is quite playable and enjoyable throughout. I never did beat it in development, although I have just now for the first time while writing this... so you can except it to get quite challenging. Some honest advice: The game will tend to hide its bugs if you don't mash keys. Keen sight and a little hesitance will escape through the final 10 levels.\n\nI'm especially proud of the idea this game presents. I plan to improve on it in the future, starting with some fixes and features that didn't make the 7pm (PST) contest deadline.\n\nAnd last but not least.. I'm VERY MUCH looking forward to trying out YOUR games over the next few weeks!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/11f0cfc2293b7bc6951a6f3eef598d75.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=5758","author":{"name":"Edsploration","uid":5758,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/eece37ffd9dc49349d0effa742ced96e?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/edsploration/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5758-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5758-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5758-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5758-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5758-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5758-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5758-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5758-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5758-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5758-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18420968/GlobularPrisonbreak.swf"},{"label":"Post-Compo (major bugs fixed)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18420968/BloopieEscape.swf"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18420968/GlobularPrisonbreak.7z"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":24,"score":4},{"area":"coolness","rank":115,"score":5},{"area":"graphics","rank":190,"score":3},{"area":"theme","rank":272,"score":2.88},{"area":"audio","rank":290,"score":1.93},{"area":"overall","rank":308,"score":2.69},{"area":"fun","rank":369,"score":2.19},{"area":"community","rank":432,"score":1.67}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Goat Milk","category":"compo","description":"COMMENTS ARE BROKEN ON THIS PAGE (off and on).\nIf you can't leave a comment here, you can leave a comment on my blog at http://stozstudios.blogspot.com/2011/08/goat-milk.html.\n\nMany weeks ago, the Dow Jones Industrial Average suddenly plunged by 500 points.

If anybody has any problems or has any suggestions please post in the comments!\n\nPost Mortem:\nI had something like 9 story screens and 1 game screen planed and after building the game and 4 screens I got so bored of drawing.  \nNext time less art and more game.  \nI was only able to commit 14 hours and I was still able to make an alright game, supper happy with my scoping not getting out of hand as I am usually really bad with that.  \nI know the musket shot stuff doesn't really make sense, I should have taken it out and used more rocks and cannon balls.  \nI was planning on doing a couple more but different little games and could have fit 1 more in if i had not done as much art.\nThe sound and the images don't sync up in the intro movie, I should have cut the audio into parts to match the images and then synked them individually.\n1440 x 900 was a good resolution to work in, except people with smaller resolutions cant play the game.  Next time I'm going to look at how to build a game that can expand to full screen.\n\nNextTime:\nLess art.\nGet a phsics engine before hand!

Hooray! Entering this competition was a great experience to have and let me actually know what it was like working under a deadline. I had to cut a lot of ideas and fancy things from the final product in order to make it a functioning game, but I'm happy how it turned out even though there isn't much to it. I will most likely enter when the next LD comes around and hopefully be more experienced so I can create something more complex.

I originally planned it to be more complex, with having the wolves chase you around, finding other rabbits and some other things. If it weren't for the 12-hour extension, this game would have a really small test room instead of a proper level and no sounds, so THANK YOU WEBSITE CRASH!\n\nThe game is sort of a dungeon crawler. It should really have more levels, but it was hard enough to make a single one and I don't have any more time. You run through a maze, find things blocking your path, and find things to unblock your path. The game's biggest feature is the turn-based fighting system I managed to put together, which I think is pretty cool for a 48-hour game. It's also pretty fun. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!\n\nEDIT: In response to the comments, the game did always feature a rabbit. I didn't really think about it, the only time it seemed weird was when I was making the bow-holding sprite, but even then it still seemed strangely natural.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/fa91a2984e86da7e7381380c7fbfe239.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=1477","author":{"name":"Petzi","uid":1477,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e720844e7c57e26577a59090908255d2?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/petzi/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/1477-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/1477-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/1477-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/1477-shot1.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/1477-shot2.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/1477-shot2.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17269641/Escape%20from%20the%20Wolf%20Castle.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17269641/Escape%20from%20the%20Wolf%20Castle%20Source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"humor","rank":186,"score":2.11},{"area":"coolness","rank":246,"score":2},{"area":"audio","rank":271,"score":2},{"area":"theme","rank":276,"score":2.86},{"area":"innovation","rank":325,"score":2.46},{"area":"community","rank":336,"score":2},{"area":"fun","rank":344,"score":2.29},{"area":"graphics","rank":360,"score":2.29},{"area":"overall","rank":398,"score":2.36}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Escape From Zoo","category":"compo","description":"Use left mouse button click the ground to make Character Dokey move~\nGreen trees are portals~\n To saved 5 pigeons for unlocking the Exit-----Orange Tree!!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/80bd6bb4a0143fa238a6b4e5d40e00e0.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=5682","author":{"name":"REIN1","uid":5682,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8eb5b483b67bf6027a490eee2e06f5fa?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/rein1/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5682-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5682-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5682-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/5682-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/651996/LD%2321_Rein_EscapeFromZoo.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://spotlightor.com/lab/unity3d/ld21_rein"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/651996/LD%2321_Rein_EscapeFromZoo_ProjectFile.7z"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":109,"score":3.39},{"area":"theme","rank":180,"score":3.22},{"area":"humor","rank":275,"score":1.78},{"area":"audio","rank":349,"score":1.14},{"area":"overall","rank":366,"score":2.5},{"area":"coolness","rank":418,"score":0},{"area":"fun","rank":433,"score":1.89},{"area":"innovation","rank":434,"score":1.94},{"area":"community","rank":513,"score":1.17}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Escape Work to get a Drink","category":"compo","description":"","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d84f108715eba2a81220e03568f7ba3a.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=845","author":{"name":"Redbone","uid":845,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/feda171dce0d644a456c50d32c72fa0e?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/redbone/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/845-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/62148/845-shot0.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://redbonebit.x10.mx/downloads/Escape%20Work%20to%20get%20a%20Drink.exe"},{"label":"Source (GMK)","url":"http://redbonebit.x10.mx/downloads/ld21.gmk"}],"ratings":[{"area":"fun","rank":35,"score":3.55},{"area":"overall","rank":44,"score":3.64},{"area":"graphics","rank":96,"score":3.45},{"area":"humor","rank":96,"score":2.67},{"area":"audio","rank":182,"score":2.5},{"area":"theme","rank":230,"score":3},{"area":"community","rank":256,"score":2.4},{"area":"coolness","rank":311,"score":1},{"area":"innovation","rank":328,"score":2.45}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":21,"title":"Henchmen, Attack!","category":"compo","description":"Are you a bad enough dude to escape the endless lair of the League of Malevolence?

One will increase the chord complexity, and the other the progression complexity.\n\nControls are WASD to move, Esc will exit, and F1 will reset the game.\n\nThis is my second entry using my own engine, Psybrus. All engine code used is based on what was located at https://github.com/neilogd/Psybrus at the start of LD.\n\nAll game code is written in GameMonkey (http://www.somedude.net/gamemonkey/). See the .gm files in \"Dist\" for all the game code. For some idiotic reason I decided to lump everything very hackly into \"game.gm\". There you will find some horrific game code, along with the music generator.
