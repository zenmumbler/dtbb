IT WAS CRAZY!\n\nI will never think to myself, \"That's all they could do in 48 hours?\" ever again. Phew!\n\nLet me just say, I really only had 24 hours to work on this competition. For the entire first day I was learning Actionscript 3 and the Flixel library as I had never really used either before. I spent that time doing tutorials and such and really only began working on my game around 10pm Saturday, or 24 hours in. See the time lapse if you don't believe me! :P\n\nAnyway, I am entering my game in the competition, but to be fair I'm not sure it even qualifies as a game seeing as you cannot win. Or perhaps I am just sadistic, haha.\n\nWhat you will experience when you play the game is the beginning of an idea, and concept for the theme \"enemies as weapons.\" The idea is you are an alien parasite who controls humans, but they can only survive so long with you in their body. You will notice that the life counter turns red at different periods for different humans. This is because I wanted to implement a mechanic where humans would start to attack you once you showed signs of infection (once the number turns red). Well, really only the army guy would attack you.\n\nAlso, I was going to make it so outside of a different pain tolerance (level when you start to show signs of infection), each human had a special ability. The army guy could shoot, medic could heal others (to help you reuse them easier), and the tech could use computers which would open doors. Combined I thought these mechanics plus some good level design would go together to make some pretty cool levels and an overall nifty idea.\n\nI definitely plan to further flesh out this idea after I rest from the weekend, and hope to have a much more polished and playable version available in the near future.\n\nA HUGE thanks to everyone from the Ludum Dare community, and also to the people in the #flixel channel on freenode. They were a big help while learning the library. I look forward to the next LD48 in 4 months.\n\nTake care,\nItzMattu\nhttp://gdg.uml.edu","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c27b94259870d8b7e99b3e2909a758e5.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&uid=2543","author":{"name":"itzmattu","uid":2543,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5a25270e819a7f027bce6a8d40731c1d?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/itzmattu/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2543-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2543-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2543-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2543-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.swfcabin.com/open/1282531885"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFa_tFzUDvo"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.itzmattu.com/LD18.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":81,"score":2.83},{"area":"coolness","rank":110,"score":4},{"area":"audio","rank":114,"score":1.89},{"area":"innovation","rank":116,"score":2.74},{"area":"theme","rank":131,"score":2.65},{"area":"graphics","rank":149,"score":1.95},{"area":"humor","rank":158,"score":1.29},{"area":"overall","rank":167,"score":1.67},{"area":"fun","rank":169,"score":1.39}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":18,"title":"Alien Super Mega Blaster","category":"compo","description":"Alien Super Mega Blaster (named by my son) is a take on Space Invaders.  \n\nThe theme is incorporated by the fact aliens do not fire back, but attack in response to you firing on them and spraying shrapnel in attempt to kill you.

Me and my friend Pete made this game below in 70ish hours, from scratch in Delphi.\n\n\nMARCH OF THE RORGERS - HOW TO PLAY\n==================================\n\nPREMISE\n-------\nBobbing up and down at the top of the screen is the blue Orb. Defend it at all costs. It is surrounded by four laser towers which provide some limited defence. HOWEVER! Those towers alone are nowhere near powerful enough on their own to halt the march of the Rorgers. Instead, you will have to rely on the building abilities of the little crab-like Builder Bot sitting in your base. The key is to turn the enemies against each other. Here's how:\n\n\nBUILD MENU\n----------\n\nCommands are executed mainly through the Build Menu, which is accessed by clicking anywhere on the terrain (except for the Orb). There are three types of command, and executing multiple commands in quick succession will cause the commands to be queued up.\n\n-SALVAGE-\nYour Builder Bot is capable of collecting resources from the land. Rocks and buildings can be salvaged by clicking on them in the terrain and selecting the 'GET' icon. Resources are important; without them there's only a limited amount that you can build. You can see how many you have in the top right corner of the screen. \n\n-SIGNS-\nYour bot is capable of building four types of signs pointing up, down, left and right. Each sign costs 10 resources and you may only build 3 signs per builder bot you have in your possession. Click where you would like to build and the build menu will appear. Select the sign you want from it, and your bot will go to work. \n\nA sign may not be placed directly near another sign; when the build menu is up you will see a red radius around locations where you cannot build.\n\n-DESTROY-\nClicking on a sign and then the hammer icon will send your Builder Bot to destroy it, for when it is no longer useful or you need to free up sign slots.\n\n\nTHE ORB\n-------\n\nThe Orb that you are guarding is a special case, as clicking on it gives you the chance to build an extra Builder Bot. Having extra builders is good because it increases your sign limit and allows more commands to be executed simultaneously, but it comes at the relatively hefty price of 50 resources.\n\n\nTHE RORGERS\n-----------\nThere are 3 different types of Rorgers; Stress Rorgers (Red), Envy Rorgers (Green) and Fear Rorgers (Black). All have the common goal of destroying your Orb but different types of Rorgers do not get along. You must use this to your advantage by guiding them into conflict with each other via the signs you build. \n\nRorgers begin at the bottom of the screen, emerging from their deployment tubes, and work their way upward before converging on your base.\n\nSigns will cause Rorgers to change direction when encountered, but they will not be fooled forever. After a while, unless they encounter another sign they will realise they have been led astray and head back towards your orb. \n\nIMPORTANT: Each Rorger will only be fooled by the same sign once, so don't expect the same trick to work twice.\n\nYou can see on the right side of the screen a chart that indicates which type of Rorger will attack which. But be warned: this may change occasionally as a result of the volatile Rorger political situation that is beyond our comprehension. \n\nTIP: Be wary of those sneaky Fear Rorgers - they like to attack your base from the sides!\n\n---\n\nGood Luck, and we hope you enjoy the game!\n\nLove from,\nSurprised Man\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/4afeb5767d14202ec6d8519e12886e3f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&uid=2392","author":{"name":"Spleeny","uid":2392,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/41089bc723f07180041a1f8b59263b83?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/spleeny/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2392-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2392-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2392-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2392-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2392-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2392-shot2.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2392-shot3.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2392-shot3.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2392-shot4.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2392-shot4.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.halofan.co.uk/projects/rorgers/Release.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":55,"score":13}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":18,"title":"Mines and Bobbleheads","category":"compo","description":"You are one small Bobblehead trapped in a blue world full of mines!

If you're having issues try making the window smaller and refreshing. If you're having severe framerate issues and are using Firefox, try switching to a WebKit-powered browser such as Chrome or Safari.]\n\nBy default, all shots are attracted to you. Use this to your advantage by letting them orbit back into the enemies. Move around to gain repulsion energy, then hit 'a' to switch and send bullets flying. The scoring metric is the time taken to clear the screen.\n\nIt's a difficult game. Take your time to get used to the mechanics, and try to have a store of repulsion energy for when you get surrounded. If you need precision, get a bullet to orbit and then switch to Repel when the shot lines up.

The theme was \"Enemies as Weapons\". Development took 26 hours from August 20th-22nd, 2010.\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nYou control a robot attempting to lure enemy seekers and spikes into mines before the mines explode. The difficulty ramps up as you destroy mines. You can build your chain multiplier for huge points. Chain resets when you take damage or let a mine explode. With each increase in difficulty there is a multiplier that will keep buffing your score.\n\nPROTIP:\nSend wall spikes into mines instead of using the seekers all the time--the base points are worth 5x as much!\n\nNOTE:\nAVOIDAL is a \"mouse skills\" type game so it was designed to be played with a mouse (or tablet perhaps.) It will be a lot harder to score well on a trackpad--sorry!\n\nTOOLS USED:\nFlash CS4 with ActionScript 3.0, Photoshop CS4, SFXR, Reason\n\nFEEDBACK:\nI really appreciate constructive feedback--especially about game balance and difficulty issues! I'll be using this feedback to release the post-compo final version. \n\nThanks so much for your time playing my game!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/2987c6c57410ae1f8bb9db7c17f52a83.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&uid=234","author":{"name":"HybridMind","uid":234,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d96824d89437d98d3eb54c2be67ca69c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/hybridmind/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/234-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/234-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/234-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/234-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/234-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/234-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/234-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/234-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://avoidal.com/compo.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://avoidal.com/avoidal-source.zip"},{"label":"Gameplay Trailer","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH0AL9sNrro"},{"label":"Post-Compo Version","url":"http://avoidal.com"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":1,"score":4.52},{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":30},{"area":"overall","rank":14,"score":3.62},{"area":"fun","rank":17,"score":3.53},{"area":"audio","rank":18,"score":3.22},{"area":"graphics","rank":24,"score":3.65},{"area":"theme","rank":30,"score":3.85},{"area":"innovation","rank":64,"score":3.18},{"area":"humor","rank":64,"score":2.48}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":18,"title":"Brain In A Jar","category":"compo","description":"Here is my final entry, broken as it might be.\n\n\n\nYou are Brian Inajar the Brain In A Jar (hilarious!)\n\nThe object of the game is to kill the VIP in each level ('V' guy).\n\nTo do this you take over his body and use your psychic \"Kill\" command!\n\nSome commands have a mental requirement which means you can't use it without weakening the mind of the host.\n\nWhen you have selected a command you can see the area which will react to you using the command.\n\n\nControls:\n\nMouse to guide your psychic projection\nMove into a body to take it over.\nRight-click to exit bodies.\n\nLeft-click to select commands, and left-click again to use it.\n\nAlso you can't restart a level.

Your ship has no direct offensive weapons, but you can pull a nearby enemy ship in with your tractor beam (Z key in the default settings) to use them as a shield, use their weapons (holding Z fires continuously), or use them as a projectile (press X to throw the ship forward with enough force to destroy another enemy). \n\nYou also have the ability to do a \"force push\" of sorts, by pressing X when you don't have an enemy tractor beam-ed in, any enemies near you will be pushed outward (and possibly into other enemies).\n\nThere are occasional powerups that cause slowmo or invincibility for 15 seconds.\n\nThe difficulty setting is  a decimal scale from 1 to 4, 1 being pretty tame, and 4 being ridiculous (the difficulty scales up the speed and amount of enemies, bullets etc).\n\nControl options allow for Arrows + X/Z, WASD + Shift/Ctrl and a couple (hopefully) dvorak friendly options.\n\nGPL'd source is included in src.zip within the Windows package.\n\nI'll try to port to Linux, eventually.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/3f20e2f0bd106a22adaca906db62ae2b.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&uid=1503","author":{"name":"Riley Adams","uid":1503,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9f46c7e951823510c91706cec06dc5a5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/praetor57/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/1503-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/1503-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/1503-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/1503-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/1503-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/1503-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.praetorianstudios.net/uploads/files/Praetor57_LD18_Fratricide_v1.0.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":24,"score":3.93},{"area":"community","rank":25,"score":3.82},{"area":"fun","rank":54,"score":3.07},{"area":"audio","rank":66,"score":2.46},{"area":"graphics","rank":74,"score":3},{"area":"overall","rank":76,"score":2.93},{"area":"innovation","rank":102,"score":2.86},{"area":"coolness","rank":110,"score":4},{"area":"humor","rank":150,"score":1.38}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":18,"title":"Graphell","category":"compo","description":"Had a lot of fun with the theme, hope you enjoy the game too.

You have no weapons or drilling equipment, and so must use your trusty tractor beam to defend yourself.  GO FOR THE KILL SCREEN!\n\nArrow keys move, pressing and holding Z activates your tractor beam.  The beam is auto targeting and will grab the nearest enemy.  While the beam is on, it is locked at a specific length.\n\nTechnical notes: This was made using the following libraries: Box2d, OpenGL, SDL, SDL_image, and SDL_mixer.  It was compiled on a Mac using XCode for the Mac version, and compiled on a Mac using a mingw port of g++ for the Windows version.  I have included the original source and the updated source for the PC port.  The only difference is that I changed the c files specifically to cpp files (I was compiling them as such in the Xcode project but I didn't want the hassle when dealing with g++) and changed the mix channels to 2 (4 was causing a crash for some reason)).  I have included the Windows makefile but I don't even know where to get that mingw toolchain anymore, so I can't really provide support there, however, if you want to compile it for windows on a windows machine, I can probably help you get set up.  If you get the game compiling, and it doesn't work when you try to run it, remember it requires some game assets that are available in the game zip file.  Also remember it requires SDL, SDL_image, and SDL_mixer, so you may need to install the runtime libraries or include them in the app file (Mac) or the project directory (Windows).\n\n(Dev notes: Procrastinated too much, especially considering that I decided mid-development to try implementing Box2d for the first time.  It was actually very easy to add and use but it cost me time.  I still like the game, and I hope you all do too, but I wish I had more enemy types.  And yes, the game has a kill screen, and crashes nicely if you reach it.  I haven't pulled it off yet because I get too greedy in the game and have too much fun spinning enemies around.)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/af507f0086077eb5b75be7aa5b1b9502.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&uid=2023","author":{"name":"drakfyre","uid":2023,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/434ad30dfd03c0e5204cf9b6eda38930?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/drakfyre/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2023-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2023-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.drakfyre.com/IHeartTractorBeamsWIN.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://www.drakfyre.com/IHeartTractorBeams.zip"},{"label":"Original Source","url":"http://www.drakfyre.com/LUDUMDARE18Source.zip"},{"label":"Updated Source","url":"http://www.drakfyre.com/LUDUMDARE18SourceUPDATED.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":56,"score":3.55},{"area":"audio","rank":57,"score":2.62},{"area":"fun","rank":64,"score":2.9},{"area":"overall","rank":109,"score":2.64},{"area":"innovation","rank":134,"score":2.52},{"area":"coolness","rank":139,"score":2},{"area":"humor","rank":141,"score":1.46},{"area":"graphics","rank":154,"score":1.82},{"area":"community","rank":167,"score":1.14}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":18,"title":"Lich","category":"compo","description":"Be sure to read the instructions below.

There was a problem with the PySFML 1.6 download for windows, compiled it from source and the game should work now.\n\nA puzzle game, featuring zombies. Don't let anybody escape to the safehouses. With two enemy types.\n\nShambler: your basic human enemy, as soon as they can hear a zombie within 3 tiles of them they start to move towards the nearest safehouse. If they get there then you fail in your mission.\n\nSniper: trained soldiers, although they can kill your zombies, you can get back at them, as years of sitting around waiting for something to happen have removed their ability to turn 180 degrees, so if you can get behind them then you can transform them easily and when they are on your side, you can use their rifle to kill far away enemies.\n\nThe zombies in this game were caused by some mysterious magical force, they can resurrect the dead corpses of slain humans. A dead zombie however, remains dead.\n\nControls:\n*  left click on a zombie to select it\n*  right click on a tile to path towards it\n*  press the spacebar or end turn button to advance 1 turn\n*  as a sniper, right click on an enemy to shoot.\n*  press R to restart the level if you get stuck\n\nOnly managed to finish making three levels in the end, but probably will add more in a post compo version. When you get past the third level you will just get a plain level with one enemy in the corner. There are level creation tools built in but they are not particularly well designed. Read below for info on how to use them.\n\nReally enjoyed this competition and hope to take part in future ludum dares.\n\nHere is how to create your own level:\n* Press E to enter the tile editor. Press one to use wall tiles and press zero to use floor tiles, click to paint\n* Press C to enter the collision editor, paint over the walls by clicking on them to make them colidable.\n* Press H to enter the entity placement editor, press 0 to place shamblers, 1 to place safehouses and 2 to place snipers. With shamblers and snipers, left click gets you a zombie and left click and shift gets you a sniper. After using the entity placement editor press R as this restarts the level and makes sure your entities will show up when you play.\n* Press P to play.\n* To save the level, press S.\n* If you need to skip forward to your level when you start up the game U skips forwards one level.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/7453ab5dba89215b72bccbf57de3cd2c.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&uid=2437","author":{"name":"Andrew Marsh","uid":2437,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8a2f265648ad81ab0890f4f3be88cf0d?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/andrew-marsh/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2437-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2437-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2437-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2437-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10426165/zombie-conquest-win.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10426165/zombie-conquest-src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":64,"score":11},{"area":"innovation","rank":78,"score":3.07},{"area":"community","rank":99,"score":2.5},{"area":"theme","rank":115,"score":2.93},{"area":"fun","rank":118,"score":2.36},{"area":"overall","rank":131,"score":2.36},{"area":"humor","rank":143,"score":1.44},{"area":"audio","rank":149,"score":1},{"area":"graphics","rank":166,"score":1.5}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":18,"title":"Alpha Channel","category":"compo","description":"This is my first LD.

I will polish this game later and put it on my website, because I like the idea of the game very much and want to polish it!\n\n;-)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/0a98c97583d123a8061e1262a7654207.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&uid=2345","author":{"name":"Spunkmeyer","uid":2345,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/62a38cebf65e623375d03c33812b0c19?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/spunkmeyer/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2345-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2345-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2345-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2345-shot1.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://games.spunkmeyer.de/downloads/Trust_Your_Enemy_fixed.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://games.spunkmeyer.de/downloads/Trust_Your_Enemy_Sources.zip"},{"label":"Crappy Gameplay Video","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2-oR1GTkLU"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":19,"score":3.88},{"area":"coolness","rank":40,"score":15},{"area":"innovation","rank":43,"score":3.4},{"area":"audio","rank":51,"score":2.73},{"area":"overall","rank":60,"score":3.07},{"area":"theme","rank":79,"score":3.33},{"area":"graphics","rank":103,"score":2.67},{"area":"fun","rank":104,"score":2.53},{"area":"humor","rank":126,"score":1.63}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":18,"title":"Zombies as Weapons","category":"compo","description":"== Zombies as Weapons ==\n\nAn entry for Ludum Dare 18.\nBy Philip Buchanan.\n\nFinding yourself surrounded by zombies, but without any weapons, you must use your bare hands to fight off the invading hoards.\n\n== Controls ==\n\n-Move using the arrow keys.\n-Control your 'hand' with the mouse.\n-Click to punch or kick.\n-Hold the mouse button down to grab hold of a zombie, and release to throw it.\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d17f75019fc330c99be133613cd4b59a.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&uid=215","author":{"name":"Surrealix","uid":215,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6c7cdd179622db03893e63476bfa4bc5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/surrealix/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/215-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/215-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/215-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/215-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.surrealix.com/ludumdare/18/surrealix_zaw.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.surrealix.com/ludumdare/18/surrealix_zaw_source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":42,"score":3.43},{"area":"coolness","rank":55,"score":13},{"area":"innovation","rank":56,"score":3.25},{"area":"humor","rank":65,"score":2.46},{"area":"theme","rank":82,"score":3.32},{"area":"overall","rank":140,"score":2.25},{"area":"fun","rank":144,"score":2.05},{"area":"audio","rank":149,"score":1},{"area":"graphics","rank":160,"score":1.68}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":18,"title":"Andrew The Angry Salmon","category":"compo","description":"Andrew The Angry Salmon is a puzzle platformer.

I thought I post it anyhow, for interests sake. Note that even though this is in the Jam, I was aiming for a Compo-compliant game, and as far as I can tell it is.\n\nThe idea for this game was inspired by the old Short Circuit game, and something fiona said on IRC ... \"taking control of robots\". It is common knowledge that all robots are evil and your enemies, so this amounts to using \"enemies as weapons\". So there is you, robots, and terminals that you can use to take control of them. The idea was to use the robots to crash into each other, and also crash through walls to help you exit the level.\n\nIn it's current state, pressing 'A' button (=Z key) while at a terminal will make a robot run in the direction that was last moving. One terminal is tied to one robot. You can crash two robots together and they die. Most testing was done zoomed out on the map so you could see everything, but for actually playing the game I think it's more fun if you can't see the whole map at one time. Problem still to be solved: controlling off-screen robots without things becoming confusing and frustrating (a radar HUD maybe ?).\n\nTimelapse for a chunk of the 48 hour part: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeChoj4nJQc\n\nStill needs: sound, proper sprite graphics, more than just test levels, robot waypoints, scoring and clearer goals etc. My mistake: trying to learn a new engine (Akihabara) during the compo+jam.

In this game, the \"enemies\" are the falling blocks, which kill you if they fall on you, and you use them as a \"weapon\" to climb higher, and earn more points.\nMore is explained in the in-game instructions.\nI know it's easy to change the highscore, but don't go around bragging if you do.\n\nAll in all, i'm /REALLY/ happy with this, considering it's taken about 32h. I've got school in six hours, so i need to get some sleep. I might make a Jam entry with some nice ambient music off the interwebs tommorrow afternoon.\n\nBut for now, have fun, enjoy, and GOODNIGHT!\n\nEDIT: I've added a timelapse. Also, about the sourcecode: the game was made in Game Maker 8, and i used some of the pro functions. to open it you'll need GM8, and to build it you'll need GM8Pro, or you will have to change those functions.\n\nI have now added a post-compo version above. Please give it a go :D\nNew features:\n-Music :)\n-Replaced arrows with something slightly more obvious\n-Some Neat gfx\n-short invincibility after respawning\n-credits\n\nI haven't included source for the new version because of size, but if you want it give me a shout at info.clockworkgames (at) gmail.com","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/65516a0a2edbe20b8b4858a59f2b7bb7.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&uid=1844","author":{"name":"AClockWorkLemon","uid":1844,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/be410846e9d3d252c1b1bc96437c9181?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/aclockworklemon/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/1844-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/1844-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/1844-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/1844-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows and Source","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/file/idua2thsn1idlp3/AfterDark%20-%20AClockWorkLemon.zip"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIJc9ZO55SM"},{"label":"Post-compo (win)","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/file/d69he2vkqs9gi24/AfterDark%20-%20AClockWorkLemon%20%28PostCompo%29.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":12,"score":3.83},{"area":"community","rank":23,"score":3.83},{"area":"overall","rank":27,"score":3.39},{"area":"fun","rank":48,"score":3.17},{"area":"graphics","rank":55,"score":3.33},{"area":"coolness","rank":82,"score":8},{"area":"audio","rank":100,"score":2.13},{"area":"theme","rank":121,"score":2.83},{"area":"humor","rank":131,"score":1.6}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":18,"title":"Camma The Huntress","category":"compo","description":"A druid who walks around banging evil spirits into each other.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/3dd071e97a0394570eae6ca86f3714ce.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&uid=2466","author":{"name":"Scramasax","uid":2466,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/39fcff4573d308b1d8a320c8e802520c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/scramasax/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2466-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2466-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://sites.google.com/site/moxiefish/CammaTheHuntress.zip?attredirects=0&d=1"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":20,"score":23},{"area":"graphics","rank":93,"score":2.79},{"area":"audio","rank":107,"score":1.94},{"area":"humor","rank":107,"score":1.81},{"area":"theme","rank":117,"score":2.89},{"area":"community","rank":123,"score":2.17},{"area":"innovation","rank":146,"score":2.33},{"area":"overall","rank":146,"score":2.11},{"area":"fun","rank":156,"score":1.83}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":18,"title":"Change of Hearts","category":"compo","description":"Instructions are provided in game.

If the enemy sees this decoy it will think it's you and begin firing. The bullets will go straight through, hopefully killing any enemies on the opposite side.\n\nThe second illusion tricks the enemy into thinking a pit (the black tiles) is a perfectly walkable tile. It will then either randomly wander into it, or walk across it while trying to chase you. Falling to his doom.\n\nThe third illusion is an upgrade to the standard decoy. Any bullet hitting this decoy will bounce back towards the attacker.\n\nAlso, at any point you can turn yourself into a rock. If the enemy does not see you do this, it may just walk straight past you, giving you a chance to get out of harms way.\n\nAlso. You have a hat.

Their rate of fire is slower, but their width provides greater cover while attached, and they take 2 shots to destroy once attached to you.\nNeedle (thin) - as common as Cruisers, Needles are the fastest ship, both in movement speed and rate of fire. However, they also take only one hit to destroy, both when attached to your ship and when active. Because of their small side, they provide limited cover when attached. However, their constant barrage of bullets makes up for it.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/8ba8c6d5ecf32d083e3a0225472cec39.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&uid=2656","author":{"name":"TheLastBanana","uid":2656,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/dcb6d91ce52b8e0037bed24878e29aac?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/thelastbanana/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2656-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2656-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2656-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2656-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2656-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2656-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2149322/Ludum%20Dare%2018/Magno-Warrior.exe"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2149322/Ludum%20Dare%2018/ld18.gmk"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":15,"score":4},{"area":"audio","rank":17,"score":3.24},{"area":"coolness","rank":35,"score":18},{"area":"innovation","rank":61,"score":3.19},{"area":"overall","rank":66,"score":3},{"area":"community","rank":82,"score":2.81},{"area":"fun","rank":98,"score":2.62},{"area":"graphics","rank":106,"score":2.62},{"area":"humor","rank":127,"score":1.62}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":18,"title":"Man Cannon","category":"compo","description":"A little tank game that I assembled in 10 hours.\n\nRun over enemy soldiers to load them into your tank's cannon.

I had no way to see what the friggin' theme was, but I was tired anyway and had to be at work the next morning for another 12 hour shift.\n\nSaturday, August 21st, 2010\nGot home super late, still no internet. Luckily I checked the theme while at work, so I had an idea of what I wanted to do. But being this far behind was depressing... and knowing that I couldn't update my LD progress and participate with the rest of the community... or possibly even SUBMIT the game... I didn't have much enthusiasm. Plus I was super tired yet again and only worked on my idea for about an hour.\n\nSunday, August 22nd, 2010\nTHE FINAL DAY. STILL NO INTERNET.\nSo I toiled away for about 4 hours and ended up with a little tech demo and nothing else. \nIt's not a game, and I didn't even have time to implement enemies. Only the weapons that were ONCE enemies. This is like seeing the sequel before the prequel. It doesn't translate well.\nI still had a chance at the jam, though... so I decided to slap some SFX and music into the game very quickly... with an intent to cram some more programming in on Monday night.\n\nMonday, August 23rd, 2010\nHAD TO WORK LATE AGAIN. The internet was finally fixed when I got home, so I spent another hour or so catching up on the LD site and prepping my tech demo for an upload. Didn't have time to add anything new, so I didn't even bother.\nAnd there you have it... my LD 18 time line. OH JOYOUS JOY. I missed it all, and that sucks. I love seeing game previews on Friday and Saturday, then playing the end result on Sunday. It's the best part of Ludum Dare, if you ask me.\n\n\n\nMAN SUCKS AND BLOWS\n-------------------\n\nUse your enemies as weapons!

By the way Ace is so elusive about his identity that he starts the game disguised as a yellow blorber thingy enemy. Can you get through the 6 stages alive?

(was supposed to be 7 didn't get time...)\n6 stages\n1 ending! Yes the game doesn't randomly exit out on you like my previous one when you beat it.\noptions to turn off sound (You wouldn't want that right XD.

not-so-much blogged about game! unfortunately I couldn't make many blog posts without revealing too much of the game/story. So yeah anyways, this is D3SCENT! I was struggling with some really bad game-breaking bugs (brought upon myself thanks to spaghetti code). So they might still be lingering. let's hope not.\n\nEDIT: one of them bugs was still creeping around, SHOULD be fixed now. Getting past the 90crate room should be possible now. Game is now Completable.\n\nAlso, forgot to mention, there are 2 endings, you'll have to experience both for the full effect. \n\nEDIT2: there's a little feature I added in the edit above, that I thought I'd mention. Pressing Pageup brings you to the crate room. I'd advise only using this if you've glitched up at said room.

Hypnotise them and send them to fight each other. Different monsters are good at beating different other monsters, so you need to choose who you hypnotise strategically.\n\nMade in Flash using ActionScript 3.0\n\n--- HOW TO PLAY ---\n\nUse the mouse to move around the landscape. Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.\n\nWhen you have 100% energy (bar on the left), click on \"Mind Control\" and click on a monster to hypnotise it. The cursor will change to red rings when you do this.\n\nWhen a monster is on your side it will change colour.\n\nClick on a monster on your side and the cursor will turn to red. Then click on a square to tell it to go there, or on an enemy monster to tell it to attack it.\n\nMonsters work in a Rock/Paper/Scissors fashion: \nGODZILLA beats TURTLE\nTURTLE beats DRAGON\nDRAGON beats GODZILLA\n\nWhen the control centre (centremost building) is destroyed the game ends.\n\n--- NOTES ON JAM VERSION ---\n\nThe Jam version is mostly identical, but tidies up the movement to make it less wobbly and more intuitive. It also has more obvious/usable instructions and cursor animations to make it easier to tell how to play.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/769e584ab975958883513c5db360b335.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&uid=2401","author":{"name":"Alistair Aitcheson","uid":2401,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/38498213153d8072021dee3fb7f26fd3?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/alistair-aitcheson/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2401-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2401-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2401-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2401-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2401-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2401-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2401-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/22150/2401-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.alistairaitcheson.com/games/inprogress/MonsterMash.exe"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.alistairaitcheson.com/games/inprogress/MonsterMash.swf"},{"label":"JAM version (web)","url":"http://www.swfcabin.com/open/1282584125"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.alistairaitcheson.com/downloads/misc/LD18.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":28,"score":20},{"area":"community","rank":43,"score":3.4},{"area":"humor","rank":53,"score":2.57},{"area":"theme","rank":55,"score":3.56},{"area":"innovation","rank":95,"score":2.92},{"area":"graphics","rank":97,"score":2.72},{"area":"audio","rank":100,"score":2.13},{"area":"overall","rank":131,"score":2.36},{"area":"fun","rank":151,"score":1.88}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":18,"title":"Project Cerebrum","category":"compo","description":"First off, the game is rather short, though It's somewhat moddable.\n\nYou are a scientist who has developed a strange technology which allows you to control other space ships with your mind.

Certain robots have abilities that can be put into use, other times controlling the 'bots is simply to get out of tight squeezes. Be careful when you decide to drop your mine and take over a 'bot because you're completely vulnerable while doing so.. other 'bots might come along and pick you off. Most of the level design was the last two hours, so it's a bit iffy. I'm curious if it's even possible to get through the eight levels. Click where you want to move to, closer the better. Double click to drop the mine in your current location, double click to remove it from anywhere. \n\nApparently some people have experienced really slow animation. I cannot account for it, since it runs fine on my 7-year old XP box and my 5-yr old laptop. It won't ever run in Internet Explorer, you guys.. Okay, well, maybe IE9. \n\nPart of the plan for this game was to do something totally cross-platform with HTML/Javascript, and ideally this sort of thing will run on an iPad or N900. I have only tested it in Firefox, Chrome and Opera and it seems to run well. \nDeveloped in Linux with GIMP, Gedit, etc. Had to dust off my old WinXP box to run an ancient copy of Reason to do the music (the box of which I'll still need to try out everyone else's stuff!!) Still nothing comparable for Linux yet, but very close.
