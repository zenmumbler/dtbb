About islands.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe object is to keep the island of Guam from capsizing for as long as possible. You accumulate points over time - more points the more stuff is on the island. Stuff will be air dropped whether you like it or not; you can call in a new building by left-clicking, or a soldier by right-clicking. You lose points if a soldier drowns, and the game ends when the island capsizes.\n\nWish List:\n\nThere was supposed to be more, like ordering soldiers to build or destroy buildings, or build flotation devices, but, I couldn't get there in time. There was also supposed to be a song, but I didn't allot enough time to learn to use GarageBand - if you sit at the title screen long enough, you can hear some of the samples I was going to use.\n\nKnown Bugs:\nThere's a bug with the soldiers where when they drown, they still move around, oops. This can lead to them 'drowning' over and over again, and you losing points for it each time. Ah, well.\n\nControls:\nLeft click drops a building, right click a soldier. Escape quits\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c9dc1233c7d8032945e54cb6a34d876d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-17/?action=preview&uid=1112","author":{"name":"philomory","uid":1112,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/eacf5ed623e72db0b87707baabd6f21a?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/philomory/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1112-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1112-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"OS X","url":"http://bitbucket.org/philomory/ld17/downloads/capsize-macosx-ppc-take-2.zip"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://bitbucket.org/philomory/ld17/downloads/capsize-win32.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://bitbucket.org/philomory/ld17/get/ld48.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":40},{"area":"humor","rank":3,"score":4},{"area":"theme","rank":31,"score":3.73},{"area":"innovation","rank":65,"score":3.2},{"area":"audio","rank":88,"score":2.43},{"area":"community","rank":117,"score":2.31},{"area":"fun","rank":128,"score":2.53},{"area":"overall","rank":151,"score":2.47},{"area":"graphics","rank":165,"score":2.29}],"platforms":["mac","desktop","win"]},{"ld_issue":17,"title":"Crowned in Doubt","category":"compo","description":"Made with Pulpcore.

Your goal is the chart as many of of these islands as you can without crashing or running out of supplies. Additional detail is inside the included readme.txt.\n\nUpdate About Graphics\nIt has come to my attention that the the game is not scaling up properly on some machines. This makes the graphics look extremely blurry, rather than blocky, which was the intent. This may have something to do with XP vs 7; I developed on 7, where it looks fine, but when tried on an XP machine, looked blurry. The game is still playable with the blurry graphics, it just doesn't look good at all (not that it looked \"good\" to start with, but you get me). As I alluded in my release notes below, I'm pretty much unavailable today (Sunday), so this is not something I'll be able to even try to fix. That's the problem with cutting an already short development time in half: little to no time spent testing or bug-fixing. I fully expect to be harshly down-graded by anyone who plays with the blurry graphics, as I should be. I suppose I'll have to chalk this one up to \"lessons learned\" and do better the next time. Sorry!\n\nNotes\nMade using Game Maker 8. My first time using it actually, though I have used previous versions in the past. I'm actively trying to learn some other game programming, namely C#/XNA and Objective-C/Cocos2D, but those are a long ways away from being something I enter any sort of competition with. This is my second LD attempt, with Caverns being the first. I was not even close to properly prepared for that one in retrospect; I didn't even start Friday night, and goofed around a bit on Saturday, before realizing Sunday morning that I was in trouble. I wound up with about a 66% completed game that was about 33% of my original vision. I wanted to really try at the next one, but after months of waiting, I gut punched when I found out that Exploration was taking place on the weekend I was moving. Arg!\n\nBut hey, there's always next time right? Believe it or not, I was screwed again: this weekend, I had to fly out mid-day Sunday for business over the next couple of days. Unbelievable! I swear that four out of five weekends, I just hang around the house with nothing special to do. But for some reason, LD conspires against me. I was all set to skip out yet again, when I decided, screw it, I'm going to at least TRY. I scaled back all ideas I had to the bare minimum possible: an Atari-esque arcade game. Something with no music, leaves-plenty-to-the-imagination graphics, play time of under a minute, and so on. And I made it! In retrospect, the game is actually incredibly basic for the amount of time I spent on it - I have a feeling the more experienced people on here could whip this thing out in hours, rather than a full day - but hey, everyone's got to start somewhere, eh?","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/3c72105fe1e34189b0f4ed8f41df12e2.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-17/?action=preview&uid=1169","author":{"name":"MJG","uid":1169,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b539fcaa78b9bb09ce8f0aeef065fe3b?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/mjg/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1169-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1169-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1169-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1169-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6220962/Games/LD17/cartograph.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6220962/Games/LD17/cartograph_source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"fun","rank":69,"score":3.05},{"area":"theme","rank":72,"score":3.36},{"area":"innovation","rank":80,"score":3.09},{"area":"audio","rank":107,"score":2.1},{"area":"humor","rank":120,"score":2.08},{"area":"overall","rank":121,"score":2.73},{"area":"community","rank":134,"score":2},{"area":"graphics","rank":161,"score":2.32},{"area":"coolness","rank":167,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":17,"title":"Deep Under an Island","category":"compo","description":"","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/73bd36e5160f5bd2ac69ec303ff0aabd.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-17/?action=preview&uid=759","author":{"name":"Sparky","uid":759,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a8eb100d88343b43022310f26be3bdcb?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/sparky/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/759-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/759-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://vacuumflowers.com/ld17/ld17"}],"ratings":[{"area":"fun","rank":9,"score":3.81},{"area":"graphics","rank":22,"score":3.85},{"area":"overall","rank":39,"score":3.48},{"area":"humor","rank":50,"score":2.89},{"area":"community","rank":56,"score":3.34},{"area":"innovation","rank":69,"score":3.15},{"area":"coolness","rank":97,"score":8},{"area":"audio","rank":140,"score":1.2},{"area":"theme","rank":198,"score":1.33}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":17,"title":"Evil Lair Command","category":"compo","description":"Premise: Protect your island lair from those pesky government agents.\n\nMy first successfully completed (for some low value of success) Ludum Dare.\n\nIt's in javascript/html5/canvas, so you need a modern browser to play it.

I still have a lot more tweaks to try but I have a sociology paper to write, so this will have to do until I get some more time.\n\nIMPORTANT: While in mid-air, the direction you're looking affects your trajectory. So if you need to jump a bit further aim up, or if you're going to overshoot an island aim down. It takes a bit of getting used to, but I think (hope...) it's fairly intuitive. (in the updated version this effect is toned down a bit, but still present)\n\nOkay, this is \"Island Hopping\", a first person platformer-ish thing (with islands!).\n\nThe goal is to jump from island to island getting as many points as possible without falling into the water (different islands give different points and there are also various powerups and bonuses).\n\nThe controls are simply mouse to look and space to jump (you automatically move forward in the direction the camera is looking). The islands are placed procedurally.\n\nAs time goes by your speed will increase and the islands will become further apart, higher difficulty modes accelerate this process (in addition to spawning smaller islands).\n\nSee the readme for more specific info.\n\nHere's a video of it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUY9C67HARc\n\nHere's the timelapse:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sGcEMPxATM\n\nUPDATE: Thanks for the feedback so far! I'm definitely going to keep working on this for a couple weeks, so I'll tweak the difficulty a bit more, allow you to turn off the music (it is pretty repetitive...), add online high scores (I almost have this working right now...) and whatever else I can.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/0834682381c61bee0d2bc390b82aa654.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-17/?action=preview&uid=1503","author":{"name":"Riley Adams","uid":1503,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9f46c7e951823510c91706cec06dc5a5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/praetor57/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1503-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1503-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1503-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1503-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows - Post Compo (Mod DB page)","url":"http://www.moddb.com/games/island-hopping"},{"label":"Windows -ORIGINAL","url":"http://sites.google.com/site/ld17praetor/release/Island_Hopping_v1.zip?attredirects=0&d=1"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://sites.google.com/site/ld17praetor/release/Island_Hopping_v1_src.zip?attredirects=0&d=1"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":66},{"area":"overall","rank":7,"score":3.92},{"area":"fun","rank":7,"score":3.83},{"area":"audio","rank":39,"score":3.26},{"area":"graphics","rank":43,"score":3.58},{"area":"community","rank":44,"score":3.55},{"area":"innovation","rank":51,"score":3.3},{"area":"theme","rank":59,"score":3.52},{"area":"humor","rank":164,"score":1.67}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":17,"title":"Island of Bounty","category":"compo","description":"Unfinished entry that I plan on continuing.\nArrow keys to move, X to fire arrows.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ea7c0f660705e7c19085f0a9d7e02b53.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-17/?action=preview&uid=1722","author":{"name":"Ashkin","uid":1722,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2383cf50e399c72fd546606fb1909322?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/ashkin/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1722-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1722-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1722-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1722-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.swfcabin.com/open/1272186446"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://www.swfcabin.com/open/1272186446"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://www.swfcabin.com/open/1272186446"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.swfcabin.com/open/1272186446"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.sendspace.com/file/ojo1bx"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":107,"score":2.56},{"area":"coolness","rank":117,"score":5},{"area":"audio","rank":143,"score":1.13},{"area":"graphics","rank":144,"score":2.61},{"area":"theme","rank":161,"score":2.36},{"area":"innovation","rank":164,"score":2.15},{"area":"humor","rank":183,"score":1.45},{"area":"fun","rank":195,"score":1.52},{"area":"overall","rank":195,"score":1.62}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":17,"title":"Island Raiders","category":"compo","description":"UPDATE:  The issue on Windows XP machines was fixed.

Make sure the Lazarus project file knows where Andorra is\n6. If on linux, download and extract the Linux libs to the folder.\n7. If on linux, search and replace \".dll\" with \".so\" [I haven't configured the source to be cross-platform without any changes]\n** This game can only be compiled for Win/Linux due to Andorra.\n\nIsolated Empire starts off with the premise that you and a few others have managed to strand yourself on an island, with no way way off other than the resources on the island and your bare hands.\n\n**** THERE IS NO TUTORIAL IN-GAME, READ THIS ****\nBasic controls:\nMouse: Interactivity\nArrow Keys: Moving the map\n\n1. Once your world has finished generating, click on the tile with the flag on it. From here, you can create more villagers. Villagers are the people that are with you, and are now inhabiting this island.\n2. Click on other tiles with objects on them to harvest. Simply press the corresponding button that pops up.\n3. IMPORTANT: Your villagers require constant sustenance. Keep a close eye on your food and water supplies, or your people will die! *** The only way to get food is to create a farm (from the bottom of the screen)\n4. So you've got some villagers now. Awesome. Now look at the top right of the screen. You should see numbers like \"1/3/10\" The first number is the number of villagers _working_. The second is the total number of villagers, and the third is how many villagers you can create.\n5. Oops you've hit your population cap? At the bottom of the screen you can click the house and click a tile to place it (must be empty, as with all others). Note that you can only have up to 250 villagers.\n6. Collect enough resources to build a raft and get away!\n7. Watch your time limit! (Upper right)\n\nCreated with:\nFree Pascal Compiler (via Lazarus IDE)\nAndorra 2D [GFX renderer]\nSDL/SDL_Mixer [Sound player]\nAnvil Studio [Original tunes]\nGXSCC [Warped those ugly anvil studio midis into 8bit deliciousness]\nGIMP [GFX]\nMedia-Convert.com [Wav->Ogg conversion]\nsfxr [SFX]\nFree Audio Editor [Bump up volume of music]\n\nI'm sure this thing is laggy as poo, and quite possibly buggy. (I submitted this barely within reach of the deadline with extremely minimal testing)\n\nI somehow doubt this game is beatable. I meant to add more HQ's you could build so you could have closer places for villagers to collect from, but I didn't have time to put that in.\n\nWhen you assign a villager to gather a resource, it will actually walk across the tiles (albeit invisibly) to its destination, gather some of the resource, and head back.\nBugs:\n1. The villagers aren't chosen closest to the destination. You may have 1 town closer to a resource, but another town's villager might wander over.\n2. The stop button doesn't work\n\nI plan on working on this more even after judging, etc.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/921021968a30a39692ce20adce48bd80.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-17/?action=preview&uid=383","author":{"name":"Daz","uid":383,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3ce7610db8af6f742295b83ecd6000f5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/daz/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/383-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/383-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://uploading.com/files/824847c7/Isolated%2BEmpire.zip/"},{"label":"Timelapse Vid","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjeU7ilMMmY"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":37},{"area":"community","rank":26,"score":3.83},{"area":"overall","rank":31,"score":3.54},{"area":"theme","rank":42,"score":3.64},{"area":"graphics","rank":48,"score":3.5},{"area":"fun","rank":54,"score":3.15},{"area":"audio","rank":66,"score":2.83},{"area":"innovation","rank":69,"score":3.15},{"area":"humor","rank":85,"score":2.43}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":17,"title":"Lonesome Flotsam","category":"compo","description":"Lonesome Flotsam\nLudum Dare 17 version by Caleb Jewett\n\nGet ready to fight for survival!

Also, the good ending now requires armor. I don't think either ending is accessible in the LD17 version due to bugs :(.\n\n1.2 Changes:\nThe new workshop actually works!

After I fix some of the bugs present in the current version, I'll put up a repo on github.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/fe24b7706d917fa9a096c84f774a496d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-17/?action=preview&uid=2012","author":{"name":"brandoncash","uid":2012,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/63243045b4d4ded39efbe7cb15b92492?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/brandoncash/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/2012-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/2012-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://playground.brandoncash.net/island/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://playground.brandoncash.net/island/src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":21,"score":3.82},{"area":"graphics","rank":40,"score":3.61},{"area":"audio","rank":51,"score":3.11},{"area":"innovation","rank":58,"score":3.24},{"area":"overall","rank":73,"score":3.08},{"area":"humor","rank":81,"score":2.45},{"area":"coolness","rank":102,"score":7},{"area":"fun","rank":107,"score":2.68},{"area":"community","rank":156,"score":1.58}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":17,"title":"Flag Island","category":"compo","description":"A CTF, platform, shooter game.

The engine has zero game logic, it's all in script so it wouldn't matter.\n\nI've now updated the Uncompressed link with that containing the uncompressed exe PLUS the actual released data set.. and I've properly beat myself about the head for my stupidity.. perhaps next LD I'll actually release something without any bugger ups!\n\n== UPDATE 2 ==\n\n== UPDATE ==\n\nI've added an uncompressed Win32 binary release as some virus scanners have been throwing hissy fits. I can only assume this is due to running the binary through UPX to compress it.\n\nIf there are any other issues, please let me know :)\n\n== UPDATE ==\n\nThe one mega zip contains all data, an AMD64 Linux binary and a Win32 binary.\n\nEngine source changes shall be up shortly once I get it committed to the branch. -- edit: They're up now, you can browse here: http://www2.xp-dev.com/sc/browse/42754/ or grab direct from SVN: http://svn2.xp-dev.com/svn/stuckie-SGZEngine/\n\nReposting the ReadMe here ( it's a ReadMe for a reason ;) )\n\nYARGH!

My first commit to the grand ludum dare!\n\nIt's a light platformer, made with python and pygame primarely. \nPhysics are done with my own physics module.\nThe basic idea is, that I wanted to see how much I could punish my processor with python and pygame, and boy did I succeed :P\nAnyway you are the robot Monty, who is stranded on a Island. \nYour goal is gather ingredients for the best breakfast in the world. No more, no less :)\nAnd of course you have to leave some Monty Python references when writing in python. A cookie to all who gets them :)\n\nControls are:\n      a - to move right\n      d - to move left\n      space - to jump\n\nThe Linux binary is made on a 64-bit architecture, Windows executable will be up monday.\n\nLooking forward to your judgement :)\n\nPrograms used:\n        The GIMP\n\nLibraries used:\n        Cython\n        Cxfreeze\n        Pygame\n        Py2exe\n\nEdit:\nHURAAA! Windows .exe is up!! It has a problem with running on wine but it should run on a windows pc.

Also everything costs\nenergy to build, so keep track of that.\n\nEarn energy by killing enemies.\n\nAmmo regenerates back up to 10.\n\nBuilding:\nYou can build islands using the right click menu.\n\nAn island costs (50) energy.\n\nAfter it's built, you can place something on it.\nSomething like:\n\nDefender - Shoots down enemies (100 energy)\nSupplier - Generates ammo (50 energy)\nHealer - Generates health (150 energy)\nSeed - Wins the game (200 energy)\n\nGoal:\nBuild 3 SEEDS to win the game\n\nOther Notes:\nSorry, the game is totally unbalanced and\nrushed right now.\n\nBut I want to go back and work on this to\nmake it a really fun and complete game!\n\nAlso, there's no sound.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a1ed5687e5e470cf7c56870ed2b829d1.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-17/?action=preview&uid=2037","author":{"name":"xerus","uid":2037,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/179f9fcafe3a7dba66091b4eb8bd5be7?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/xerus/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/2037-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/2037-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/2037-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/2037-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/2037-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/2037-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/2037-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/2037-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/2037-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/2037-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://retroaffect.com/uploads/Gaiadi_v0_48.zip"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhsQaNGwUgQ&fmt=37"}],"ratings":[{"area":"overall","rank":1,"score":4.04},{"area":"fun","rank":2,"score":4.11},{"area":"graphics","rank":6,"score":4.3},{"area":"innovation","rank":8,"score":4},{"area":"theme","rank":33,"score":3.7},{"area":"coolness","rank":85,"score":10},{"area":"community","rank":123,"score":2.2},{"area":"audio","rank":146,"score":1},{"area":"humor","rank":158,"score":1.78}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":17,"title":"Hungry Hungry Castaways","category":"compo","description":"Your ship has crashed on an island.

It is an interactive fiction game entitled Islands Far Away.\n\nIt is a game about a game programmer entering Ludum Dare and trying to create a game about islands.\n\nIf you haven't tried interactive fiction, I urge you to try it. This is not the typical text adventure. I think it should take about 15-30 minutes to finish. There is dark humor, strong language, and toilet humor. I would probably give this game an R rating if it was a movie, just to warn you.\n\nGeeks and programmers should at least identify with some of it and hopefully will enjoy it as well.\n\nIt will run on any browser that supports javascript:\n\n[EDIT: better link: supports ipad, etc]\nhttp://parchment.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/parchment.html?story=http%3A//www.bitjets.com/islands.js\n\n[OLD LINK]\nhttp://www.bitjets.com/parchment.html?story=http://www.bitjets.com/islands.zblorb\n\nEnjoy and please let me know what you think!\n\nPS, there is only one way to die, can you find it? \n\nAlso, make sure you discover the back story as well as solve the puzzles for full enjoyment of the ending.\n\n[UPDATE]\nI have made a hint file. WARNING, THIS WILL RUIN THE FUN OF THE GAME. I would suggest using it only as a last resort.\n\nHere is the hint file:\n\nhttp://www.bitjets.com/islands_far_away_hints.htm\n\nAlso, this game is actually better if you use a stand-alone program instead of the javascript version.  You can save your game progress, it is faster and you get better fonts among other things.\n\nYou can download the game file here:\n\nhttp://www.bitjets.com/islands.zblorb\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/3ecf26d09af98931ff99c53b0d7481e7.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-17/?action=preview&uid=258","author":{"name":"sfernald","uid":258,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c2e95f1552dd5304e76f945cde08f8cd?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/sfernald/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/258-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/258-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://parchment.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/parchment.html?story=http%3A//www.bitjets.com/islands.js"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://parchment.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/parchment.html?story=http%3A//www.bitjets.com/islands.js"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://parchment.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/parchment.html?story=http%3A//www.bitjets.com/islands.js"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://parchment.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/parchment.html?story=http%3A//www.bitjets.com/islands.js"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.bitjets.com/islands.zblorb"}],"ratings":[{"area":"humor","rank":19,"score":3.48},{"area":"coolness","rank":97,"score":8},{"area":"innovation","rank":129,"score":2.52},{"area":"community","rank":132,"score":2.06},{"area":"fun","rank":141,"score":2.39},{"area":"overall","rank":160,"score":2.39},{"area":"theme","rank":172,"score":2.13},{"area":"graphics","rank":198,"score":1.43}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":17,"title":"Jealous Gods","category":"compo","description":"Name: Jealous Gods\nDevelopment Environment: FlashDevelop\nLanguage/Toolkits: Actionscript 3/Flixel\nArt tools: Photoshop, sfxr (sound creation), Goldwave (sound editing)\n\nI am so tired, here is my ultra-rushed description.  You play as a jealous volcanic island god, who must blow up the other gods that you encounter.\n\nWhat went right:\n\nA friend inspired me to come up with what I thought was a pretty good idea.  Everybody I passed it across said they liked it.  After wasting a few hours agonizing over the theme, I was able to start work on what should have been a solid game.\n\nAll of the levels of the game (3 in total, LOL) are playable.\n\nWhat went wrong:\n\nWell, first of all, Mother Nature took up almost half a day from me due to very bad storms (torandos and hail!)  After that, I was back on track, but then I decided to take a break at the beginning of my second day.

The original is also in a link above for the purists:\n\n*Pirates who manage to get through both cannon and sword defenses will now steal all your stuff rather than just saying they did.\n*The queen will now not select coins or cannons for the quest as they were problematic.\n*Pirates can no longer show up with negative number of swords and cannons.\n*Removed exploit where player could get out of a pirate battle by hitting the X on the window.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/643e59e3b0d7259a47f6888dbf561590.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-17/?action=preview&uid=1128","author":{"name":"Serilyn","uid":1128,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e90c2080532864e341f122b3b17cd07c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/serilyn/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1128-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1128-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1128-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1128-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1128-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1128-shot2.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (BugFix)","url":"http://serilyn.com/VoyageForTheQueen/"},{"label":"Web (Original)","url":"http://serilyn.com/VoyageForTheQueenOriginal/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://serilyn.com/VoyageForTheQueen/VoyageForTheQueenSrc.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":37,"score":20},{"area":"theme","rank":45,"score":3.63},{"area":"community","rank":101,"score":2.67},{"area":"graphics","rank":120,"score":2.82},{"area":"innovation","rank":123,"score":2.57},{"area":"overall","rank":129,"score":2.69},{"area":"audio","rank":131,"score":1.4},{"area":"fun","rank":161,"score":2.19},{"area":"humor","rank":171,"score":1.57}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":17,"title":"Whales Deep","category":"compo","description":"First-time entry.

The goal in the game is to prevent fish from reaching the open sea.\n\nThe fish spawn from the top left corner and try to get to the bottom right corner using the shortest possible path. Islands can be created to make their journey longer and more difficult. Towers can be built on top of the islands to actually kill them.\n\nIslands can be created and towers can be built using the left mouse button. There's only one type of tower, but it can be upgraded multiple times. Islands can be sold using the right mouse button.\n\nAs the game is rather simple, I made it quite hard to even get the highest upgraded tower. As in almost all tower defense games, it matters a lot where you build your towers and which towers you upgrade.\n\nIt's a 3D game and the camera can be freely moved and rotated (although there's not much need for it).\n\nI used 3ds Max to create the models and Paint Shop Pro for the textures. The game is written in C++ and OGRE is used for the rendering. The Windows download link has sources included. The source link contains only the sources.\n\nThis was my first time entering Ludum Dare and I'm happy that I got at least something done. I'm happy with how the game looks as I'm no artist and I think I did good for myself. But the gameplay is too simple. It would've needed at least a freezing tower or something like that. I should've taken some time away from other things. I used about 19 hours in total including planning and this little documentation. It was a bit less than I had intended, though life rarely goes as planned :)\n\nEdit: I had originally planned on having both direct3d and opengl options but on one case the game would crash even before the choosing dialog if direct3d option was enabled. Then I just commented it out in the plugins file. Now I re-enabled it since I guess it causes less problems that way. It can be disabled just by commenting (or removing) the direct3d line in bin/plugins-windows.cfg\n\nEdit2: Ok sorry for the crashing. Seems there was a bug with fish speed normalization. In a very special case a fish might have a zero speed which resulted in division by zero which later on led to crashing. Hopefully the game won't crash anymore :)\n\n@Endurion: I am here for the first time, but at least in the submission rules it says \"After the deadline, we do allow bugfixes. You're allowed to fix any bugs that stop a player from playing or finishing your game\". The two fixed I have done changed nothing in how the game works, it just shouldn't crash anymore. I could include the previous version too, but there's really nothing different except you're not allowed to choose d3d and it often crashes while playing.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/fa7deff341a1a75bfe323c41e31a7046.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-17/?action=preview&uid=1908","author":{"name":"Dzarg","uid":1908,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c858dd9797c779305801664d1dad2e2?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/dzarg/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1908-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1908-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1908-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1908-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1908-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1908-shot2.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1908-shot3.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/1908-shot3.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://markku.velinen.fi/islands/IslandTowers.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://markku.velinen.fi/islands/IslandTowers_source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":38,"score":3.63},{"area":"coolness","rank":72,"score":11},{"area":"fun","rank":82,"score":2.94},{"area":"community","rank":93,"score":2.79},{"area":"overall","rank":96,"score":2.88},{"area":"theme","rank":124,"score":2.94},{"area":"humor","rank":174,"score":1.56},{"area":"innovation","rank":175,"score":2}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":17,"title":"islands","category":"compo","description":"","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c9cb42d65e78c464fcccdf7c53dd774f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-17/?action=preview&uid=492","author":{"name":"increpare","uid":492,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ca845090d87944529a93ba120adfc2cc?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/increpare/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/492-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/15900/492-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://ded.increpare.com/~locus/islands/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://ded.increpare.com/~locus/islands_src.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":26},{"area":"graphics","rank":110,"score":2.9},{"area":"innovation","rank":119,"score":2.6},{"area":"audio","rank":131,"score":1.4},{"area":"community","rank":150,"score":1.74},{"area":"humor","rank":154,"score":1.81},{"area":"theme","rank":170,"score":2.17},{"area":"overall","rank":182,"score":2.11},{"area":"fun","rank":199,"score":1.34}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":17,"title":"Kallista's Dream","category":"compo","description":"I took sort of a weird approach to the theme, and based it more on the unconscious significance of islands then on islands themselves. There is an Island, its even a fairly important part of the game, both in gameplay and in premise, that being said, there is also a much larger metaphorical island.\n\nIt plays somewhere in between NiGHTs and any good old fashioned treasure shootem up.\n\nSense the tutorial text kinda jumps by sometimes, I guess Ill just post controlls. Move with the arrow keys, fairly straight forward there, double tap a direction to dash attack. Dash attacking into an enemy kills it (or at least hurts it,) and gives you a glowing aura. You can use that aura to figure out how close you are to the objective (blue = really far away, red = close) There are three levels, kind of, even tho they are all the same, just with more enemies that move slightly faster. You get some plot between levels, and then the DRAMATIC PLOT TWIST at the end. Its kind of a depressing game. Sorry. You also will fire a huge spread of projectiles that home in on enemy's if you dash attack enough. These frequently end up killing offscreen enemies and giving you randomly awesome kill combo multipliers. THIS IS A FEATURE! NOT A BUG!... okay, well, maybe its a bug.\n\nThe For loop that builds the level is kinda broken (actually, the whole level building part is kinda broken...) so it takes a second to load the playstate, just bare with it, it (probably) didnt crash.\nThis needs some hardcore optimizations to be totally honest, but its still pretty fun, and this was a totally new experience for me. (I have all of one other game under my belt, and have only been learning actionscript and flixel for a few months...)\n\nOh... code note, I made this in flash develop using flex 3.4 and flixel v2.34.\nI used some vst stuff, fruity loops, an old midi man keyboard, a simmons sd7k drumset, and an old epiphone guitar for the soundtrack. This includes the sound fx. I was trying to get all of the audio to blend together and create a really surreal feel, and Im fairly happy with it. I wish I could have synched the piano to the text better, but ala's flash is balls for handling sound.\nThe graphics where all drawn in Graphics Gale, mostly with the pencil tool, although I did cheat and let code do some of the work for me (like the water is actually just a 32x32 square that gets re sized to make waves...)\n\nAnyhow, Enjoy.

For instance, replace the contents with:\n\nlua main.lua 800 600\nor\nlua main.lua 1024 768 fullscreen\n\n(or run these commands directly...)\n\nControls\n--------\n\nThe game was designed to be used with a gamepad (I have a DualShock clone), but provides keyboard replacements as well.\n\nD-pad/Arrows : move\nLeft and right shoulders / S and F : rotate camera\nLeft and right triggers / E and D : zoom in and out\nCross / Spacebar : bring menu, select, action, etc.\nCircle / G : cancel\n\nAnd shortcuts, without which it is still possible to play:\nSquare / R : place beacon\nTriangle / T : place boat\n\nNow of course, all gamepads have different numbering systems and that kind of stuff, and since there is no ingame keymapper, you'll have to modify the file keymap.lua. It should be mostly self explanatory. You can of course modify the default keys as well.\n\nAdditional keys, mostly for fun:\n\n1: toggle wireframe\n2: toggle land color\n3: print FPS rate\n4: while held, water raises a lot faster\nEscape: quit instantly\n\nGameplay\n--------\n\nThe inhabitants of this small world are pretty dumb. They will wander randomly, and only flee the water when it is really close. But they can get trapped on islands and die tragically there when the water comes, which is why you need to guide them.\n\n1. Beacons\n\nPlace a beacon above the land by bringing the menu and chosing the weird four-piked item, or alternatively, by pressing \"place beacon\". The circle around it is its area of influence. Guys in it will be attracted to the beacon.\n\nTo remove a beacon, place the cursor close to it and press \"beacon\" or \"action\" (shortcuts come in handy when objects are close to each other).\n\nNote that you have a limited number of beacons at the same time on the map. When the limit is reached, the first ones will disapear.\n\n2. Boats\n\nCreate a boat on the sea by bringing the menu and chosing the flat round item, or alternatively, by pressing \"place boat\".\n\nPressing \"action\" near the boat will bring its own menu, with three items: load, unload, destroy.\nChose load, move the cursor to a land zone with people, and press \"action\". The boat will start moving towards the goal, and when it arrives, all the people within the area of influence indicated when aiming will try to board the boat.\n\nThere are only 10 places on a boat.\n\nUnloading works the same. Sometimes the boat will not unload, because the terrain is not safe, try again seconds later, or further away.\n\nDelete, well, deletes the boat, including its passengers.\n\nThere is also a limited number of boats, but the first ones won't be automatically deleted. Instead, the \"boat\" item will not show up in the menu.\nSometimes the guys are really dumb and throw themselves to the sea while trying to board the ship. Oh well...\n\n\n3. Teleportation towers\n\nThe third item in the menu, tall pyramid with four legs, is a teleportation tower. Place it on the ground, like a beacon. Note that it takes some time to build. You can cancel its creation by bringing up its menu and chosing the delete item.\n\nOnce built, a new item will appear in its menu: linking to another tower. Chose it, move near another tower, and press \"action\". Note that the towers must be in line of sight. A red line (instead of the lightnings) indicate non line of sight.\n\nOnce linked to another tower, a new item appears: calling people. All the people in a close range around the tower will enter it, and reappear outside the linked tower. Use in conjunction with a beacon to attract people as close as possible.\n\nNote that you are limited to 4 towers. Note also that the links are one way. If you can explicitly make to towers point at each other, it is in no way mandatory. You can make a network, or a chain, or anything you like. Remember also that you can change the target by selecting again the link item.\n\n4. Arks\n\nThe ultimate shelter. The boats are safe, but they contain only a few people. To save your entire population, you need to build these huge floating cities. Each shelter can hold 100 persons.\n\nYou are not limited in the number of shelters you build.\nBeware, the construction is not automatic like teleport towers. The construction speed is proportionnal to the number of people close to the ark! Use beacons to attract people really close!\n\nOnce built, the ark's menu contains one option: making the close people embark. You cannot destroy an ark, or unload its passengers.\n\nOnce the water reaches the ark, it will start floating to safety!\n\n5. Victory?\n\nThere is no winning or losing condition. The aim is to save as many people as possible. The game stops when all the people are either dead, or rescued.\n\nDuring the game, you can check your advance by bringing up the menu. The numbers shown are the people still in need of rescue, and the people rescued. The game always starts at 500.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThe source code is under GNU GPL v3.\nMusic and graphics are cc-by-nc-sa.\n\nGNU/Linux notes:\n----------------\n\nThe game comes with a precompiled binary (evolcore.so) created on a Ubuntu system. If it doesn't work on your particular distribution, compile evolcore.c into a shared library evolcore.so, linked against the libraries mentioned earlier. You can use the provided SConstruct, if you have the scons building system
