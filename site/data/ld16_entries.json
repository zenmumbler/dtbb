This queen, however, is quite picky about her honey. As a result, she demands nothing less than perfection from her workers...and absolute obedience.  Gather pollen from the flowers that the queen indicates - in exactly the order she indicates - and all will be well.  If you forget the sequence, or mess it up, you'll have to start all over.  To receive orders or turn in pollen, use the arrow keys to enter the hive. The queen will tell you which sequence of flowers you must get. If you have completed a sequence, she will sing you a happy song. If you get the sequence wrong, she will scold you and you will have to start over.  If at any time you forget the sequence, you can enter the hive again to look at it, but if you have one wrong, then you'll start over.  Note: this is meant to be a memory game, so there is no help remembering where you are in the sequence once it is given to you. This is intentional.  Also you will find little yellow drops of honey on the ground which you can eat for bonus points. By the way you can win the game, but it might be difficult unless you cheat.  Oh yes, also don't fly past the fence as there is nothing out there. I toyed with the idea of making the bee not be able to go through the fence, but, hey - bees can fly!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/2ebd2237b68dfa077a23ee6936992996.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-16/?action=preview&uid=1105","author":{"name":"recursor","uid":1105,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c9c3dca8879cc03848a3896980d10e4e?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/recursor/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1105-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1105-shot0.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows (v0.1)","url":"http://proto.pixelbytestudios.com/jams/BeesnFlowers/BeesAndFlowers_v0.1_Win.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://proto.pixelbytestudios.com/jams/BeesnFlowers/BeesAndFlowers_v0.1_Mac.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://games.writeline.net/BeesnFlowers/BeesnFlowers_v0.1_source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":1,"score":83},{"area":"audio","rank":6,"score":3.86},{"area":"humor","rank":16,"score":3.2},{"area":"fun","rank":60,"score":2.68},{"area":"overall","rank":66,"score":2.86},{"area":"graphics","rank":71,"score":2.68},{"area":"innovation","rank":75,"score":2.71},{"area":"community","rank":81,"score":2.47},{"area":"theme","rank":84,"score":2.95}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":16,"title":"Boboil's Adventure","category":"compo","description":"BAM, Boboil's Adventure is done!\n\nThis is one of those games where you click \"next day\" and events happen for that day, and then the day ends, and repeat.\n\nThis game is made using Flash CS4 with Actionscript 2.0.

Utena's entry uses XNA with VS2.0 and PS2.0, same as mine (AFAICR), so if that one works then this one should too. :(","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c54069d5f6af376bc29b6ecdfa326667.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-16/?action=preview&uid=792","author":{"name":"5parrowhawk","uid":792,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fde271b42af958825575742921d249c9?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/5parrowhawk/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/792-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/792-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/792-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/792-shot1.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://sites.google.com/site/haitaka/ludumdare16/GBIS.zip?attredirects=0"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://sites.google.com/site/haitaka/ludumdare16/LD16_5parrowhawk_GBIS_source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":14,"score":3.73},{"area":"community","rank":25,"score":3.56},{"area":"overall","rank":30,"score":3.27},{"area":"theme","rank":37,"score":3.64},{"area":"coolness","rank":42,"score":17},{"area":"fun","rank":46,"score":2.91},{"area":"innovation","rank":64,"score":2.82}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":16,"title":"Gravity","category":"compo","description":"Here is my game, \"Gravity\".

Colonies automatically grow as years go by. They also generate points both for themselves, and for trade routes.\n\nDiving into a sun is the primary way to get more energy.

I didn't get to implement everything I wanted to, but I ended up with a great foundation with a lot of potential, I think.\n\nMake sure you have some music playing in the background because I didn't have time to utilize ANY sound whatsoever.\n\nIt's a 2-D platform / adventure game where the entire focus is on exploration and trying to figure out what's going on. You aren't really told what to do or how to do it, so you have to explore your surroundings.\n\nIt's like Wall-E meets Fallout, crossed with Metroid minus the fighting. There are no enemies. Just you and the world. Your only real enemy is your constantly depleting battery. The game ends when you run out of juice or when you get to a certain door.\n\nI had a BLAST doing this!\n\nTools used\n----------\n\nGame Maker 7 Pro\nAdobe Photoshop CS4\n\n\nCONTROLS\n--------\n\nLeft / Right------------MOVE\nUp----------------------JUMP (with powerup)\nDown--------------------Search / Use\nEnter-------------------Open HUD display\nX-----------------------Close HUD display\nESC---------------------Quit Game\n\nJUMPING: You cannot jump until you find the correct powerup. Jumping works differently in this game than most. Because you control a robot and your jump is controlled by a simple hydraulic rod, you have to be moving in order to jump at an angle and you cannot adjust while in midair. Jumping will drain your battery quickly, so be careful.\n\nHUD/Battery: Be sure to check your HUD (Enter) often to keep track of your battery power. There are two bars on the HUD. The top bar is your battery power. When your battery power gets low, an icon will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen.

The facility is guarded by dogs that the player will have to sneak past.\n\nAs the player, your mission is to locate the hot dog motherlode, a supply so massive, it could feed all foxkind for decades. Yes, hot dogs. A resource more precious than gold...\n\nOnce you have located the mother lode, you are to report back to base. When you have left the building, an escort team will take you the rest of the way.\n\nIn the storage facility, there are numerous guard dogs. Big, mean, stupid guard dogs that will chase you down and kill you on sight. You can't outrun them, they're too fast. You can only keep them off your tail for so long.\n\nYou're much, much more agile, though. You can dodge around quickly. If you're spotted, I'd advise you to put as many obstacles between you and the dog who saw you as you can, as quickly as you can.\n\nYou can also sneak by them. While these dim-witted bullies can barely breathe without making noise, you are able to be completely silent. Well, until you start running, anyway.\n\nYou only have so much stamina, so you'll need to rest now and then. You'll also need to eat hot dogs to keep your strength up. Don't worry, humans vastly underestimate the value of hot dogs, and have left them laying around, trusting that their precious guard dogs won't eat them.\n\nWe don't know anything about the facility, other than the fact that the objective is somewhere within. We can only guess what kind of mad labyrinth the humans have built.\n\nGood luck, and be careful.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/2af5e08a474741e4a5d370136462d30f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-16/?action=preview&uid=979","author":{"name":"Henry McLaughlin","uid":979,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/53516aab3688333e1f42091a6e204521?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/pycron/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/979-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/979-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Python Source","url":"http://pycron-ld48.googlecode.com/files/Hot%20Dog%20Hunter.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":31,"score":3.5},{"area":"coolness","rank":101,"score":0}],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":16,"title":"islomania","category":"compo","description":"islomania is defined as a craze for or strong attraction to islands.\n\ncontrols:\narrow keys to move\nx to claim an island\np to permanently settle on an island","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/f54cbfbb0a8e1428e76c8363a6c9b50a.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-16/?action=preview&uid=1398","author":{"name":"hazman","uid":1398,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/55713f3e0acc977dcc959e3e855c2541?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/hazman/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1398-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1398-shot0.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.zshare.net/download/6985793654133695/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":34,"score":3.71},{"area":"humor","rank":48,"score":2.43},{"area":"innovation","rank":56,"score":2.93},{"area":"coolness","rank":62,"score":11},{"area":"fun","rank":79,"score":2.36},{"area":"graphics","rank":81,"score":2.57},{"area":"community","rank":84,"score":2.33},{"area":"overall","rank":93,"score":2.5}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":16,"title":"Missing","category":"compo","description":"After surviving a horrific plane crash, explore a beautiful tropical island in search of berries.

Diagonal touching counts.\n- oil rigs pump faster when there is more oil below them.\n- click once on the game to make keyboard controls work.\n\nMade in ActionScript (Flash) using FlashDevelop.

Good luck. \n\nUsed Flash CS4, Photoshop CS2, SFXR\nTook me something like 12 hours of slow work ( :( dissatisfied with my performance and time I had)\n\n\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/eca7c1af7919e068a5e81cf016090bee.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-16/?action=preview&uid=232","author":{"name":"wonderwhy-er","uid":232,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/65a0187ab622c5b0762580622e43898d?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/wonderwhy-er/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/232-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/232-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/232-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/232-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/232-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/232-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.deviantart.com/download/146668876/Age_of_Exploration_EXE_by_wonderwhy_ER.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2009/347/e/9/Age_of_Exploration_by_wonderwhy_ER.swf"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.deviantart.com/download/146669162/Age_of_Exploration_Source_by_wonderwhy_ER.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":12,"score":3.9},{"area":"theme","rank":13,"score":3.97},{"area":"fun","rank":14,"score":3.45},{"area":"overall","rank":24,"score":3.4},{"area":"coolness","rank":53,"score":14},{"area":"audio","rank":65,"score":2.12},{"area":"community","rank":70,"score":2.68},{"area":"humor","rank":80,"score":2},{"area":"graphics","rank":97,"score":2.21}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":16,"title":"Colonial Age","category":"compo","description":"Explore all islands with your ship before the enemy does.

However, the compressed version is significantly smaller than 4k, despite not being fully optimized.\n\nThe linked source code also includes the source for the level editor I made for the game.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/9c6e1cc326850f3ccaed998154df99bd.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-16/?action=preview&uid=392","author":{"name":"Morre","uid":392,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ddad7b99af480df14c365e0bc9ee0606?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/morre/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/392-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/392-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.x2d.org/java/LD/LD16/littleworlds4k.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.x2d.org/java/LD/LD16/LittleWorlds4k-source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":14,"score":3.8},{"area":"fun","rank":42,"score":2.95},{"area":"graphics","rank":58,"score":2.9},{"area":"overall","rank":59,"score":2.95},{"area":"coolness","rank":86,"score":3},{"area":"audio","rank":87,"score":1},{"area":"community","rank":92,"score":2.27},{"area":"theme","rank":93,"score":2.8},{"area":"humor","rank":99,"score":1.67}],"platforms":["web","java"]},{"ld_issue":16,"title":"LoneStranger's Explore","category":"compo","description":"A simple 'thing' since it's not a game.

Lost? can pretty much be summarized as a cross between Knytt Stories and Metroid. Actually, it took inspiration from both. You play as an unnamed character as you try to find your way out of your predicament from, well, being lost.\n\nThe controls are simple. Use the arrow keys to move around and 'Z' to jump. To save, just climb on top of a yellow save pad and press down.\n\nPlease, if you want the window to be bigger, just press F4. Don't strain your eyes. You need those.\n\nIf the game crashes for anyone (as far as I know it has only happened once, this is no widespread problem), then tell me the circumstances so I can fix it as the rules say we can fix bugs preventing people from beating the game.\n\nHint: For those of you trying to ascend the Flower Room (you will know what it is when you get there), make sure you save at the save point to the right (in the same room you started in) after you climb up. Or not, if you want to make the game much harder for yourself.\n\nEdit: I wasn't aware the source was required. I've included it now. In order to play properly, it needs all the data files included in the Windows download, so make sure you've downloaded that first.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/617f53f2c58cb44b009b0becedb9004b.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-16/?action=preview&uid=1539","author":{"name":"retrogamer500","uid":1539,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e71c8ce13fab0c4806c13a85176c7c6e?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/retrogamer500/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1539-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1539-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1539-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1539-shot1.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1539-shot2.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1539-shot2.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1836892/games/Lost.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1836892/games/lost_source.gmk"}],"ratings":[{"area":"audio","rank":8,"score":3.79},{"area":"fun","rank":16,"score":3.33},{"area":"overall","rank":18,"score":3.46},{"area":"graphics","rank":32,"score":3.46},{"area":"theme","rank":42,"score":3.58},{"area":"humor","rank":45,"score":2.5},{"area":"community","rank":86,"score":2.32},{"area":"coolness","rank":86,"score":3},{"area":"innovation","rank":94,"score":2.46}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":16,"title":"Mine","category":"compo","description":"","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/fa2918374f4e70b2897a8dd2e08e8b49.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-16/?action=preview&uid=1527","author":{"name":"Noel","uid":1527,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/920af0bc2ad041979be18e8c8ec3ef28?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/drazzke/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1527-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1527-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.drazzke.com/projects/The%20Mine.exe"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":42,"score":3.25},{"area":"fun","rank":44,"score":2.94},{"area":"theme","rank":60,"score":3.38},{"area":"overall","rank":63,"score":2.88},{"area":"humor","rank":72,"score":2.14},{"area":"innovation","rank":100,"score":2.38},{"area":"coolness","rank":101,"score":0},{"area":"community","rank":105,"score":1.8}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":16,"title":"Needlesoft Haystack Explorer","category":"compo","description":"Explore exactly 100,000 straws of a haystack to find a needle that makes it wither.\n\nBecome worlds best haystack explorer!!!\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/353cb0dde2a7097ff596d2ef279beff1.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-16/?action=preview&uid=1405","author":{"name":"Sos","uid":1405,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b9d3f88d56e788e4e111a32ab2bce11a?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/sos/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1405-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1405-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1405-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1405-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1405-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1405-shot2.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://so0os.pl/ld16/haystack.zip"},{"label":"Windows mirror","url":"http://www.gizycko.mm.pl/~stora_s/sos/haystack.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":41},{"area":"innovation","rank":8,"score":4},{"area":"humor","rank":8,"score":3.44},{"area":"audio","rank":9,"score":3.74},{"area":"overall","rank":33,"score":3.2},{"area":"graphics","rank":38,"score":3.3},{"area":"fun","rank":51,"score":2.85},{"area":"community","rank":59,"score":3},{"area":"theme","rank":73,"score":3.15}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":16,"title":"Robot Wants Kitty","category":"compo","description":"This is Robot Wants Kitty, the story of a robot who wants a kitty.

The reason is simple. The enemies get you depending on their level. And a level of 1/2/3 and lifeforce of 2500 does not really show in the first levels, that's why. And that the shield is too strong (completely filling you up again) is also another thing. Yeah, it was harder before, and thinking that a lot of people would get frustrated with that, I turned the enemy strength down\n\n\nHey there fellas, final version!\nDescription:\n- Programmed with Gosu in Ruby! Simple, fast, fun, leaving more time for graphics and gizmos\n- Graphics in Photoshop. If you're wondering why the enemies are so generic, that's Wingdings :D\n\nTo the game:\n- You are supposed to search through space for specific specimen. you can see which ones you are supposed to find on the right side of the screen (yellow would indicate that you found it already). killing them with your laser is sufficient :D. let's say the beam is a tracking beam, and they shrink or something. ^^\n- the game is supposed to give you a feeling of Touhou or something, but I created too many objects I guess and it got slow, so I took a lot of things out\n- forgot to add to the tutorial that you can also press down to retreat. that's because at that point I made the tut already, and well, was too tired to change it\n- even though I wanted to add sound, I left it out because the ones I made didn't gave me the right feeling I wanted to have for this game.\n- my left arm hurts. Actually, it feels empty (kinda) up to the fingertips. Need moar sleep\n- also made the enemies easier. their reach is a tiny bit smaller than yours :D\n- would have been great to add a huge endboss. but that wouldn't fit the theme anymore","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/638a31c67a8bb373418959d0bf80bbbd.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-16/?action=preview&uid=717","author":{"name":"pythong","uid":717,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cc472e6d34a7efbaab8ff0e0305e0688?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/pythong/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/717-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/717-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/717-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/717-shot1.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://tinyurl.com/yhlawhg"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://tinyurl.com/yzbp6rq"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://tinyurl.com/yzbp6rq"},{"label":"Youtube","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oldj0JocqlI"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://tinyurl.com/yzbp6rq"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":30},{"area":"humor","rank":41,"score":2.56},{"area":"graphics","rank":49,"score":3},{"area":"fun","rank":54,"score":2.78},{"area":"community","rank":55,"score":3.18},{"area":"overall","rank":78,"score":2.72},{"area":"innovation","rank":82,"score":2.61},{"area":"audio","rank":82,"score":1.2},{"area":"theme","rank":85,"score":2.89}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":16,"title":"The Europa Arcology Incident","category":"compo","description":"TEAI is a Roguelike game written in java.

Blender and photoshop were used for the art.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/51416ea61e0958e57c1b3985127a2037.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-16/?action=preview&uid=1128","author":{"name":"Serilyn","uid":1128,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e90c2080532864e341f122b3b17cd07c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/serilyn/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1128-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1128-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1128-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1128-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1128-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1128-shot2.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1128-shot3.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/1128-shot3.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://sites.google.com/a/serilyn.com/ludumdare/tomb-thief-1/TombThief.zip?attredirects=0&d=1"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":12,"score":3.79},{"area":"humor","rank":37,"score":2.67},{"area":"overall","rank":37,"score":3.14},{"area":"theme","rank":63,"score":3.36},{"area":"fun","rank":64,"score":2.57},{"area":"coolness","rank":74,"score":7},{"area":"community","rank":79,"score":2.54},{"area":"innovation","rank":96,"score":2.43}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":16,"title":"Tree","category":"compo","description":"My game is called Tree, and you have to explore what to do to it. :) I guess every game in existence fits the theme if you think about it.\n\nAnyway, my original idea was to make a the tree a \"tree of life\"/paradise kind of thing and have the explorer raze it (i.e. by anything you do, harms the tree and the less you ended up harming it, the better you did). It doesn't sound exactly fun, but that was the idea. Kind of like reversing the exploration theme. And it was supposed to be a bit more adveturish with supporting characters and dialog, but time didn't allow. (And my pixel art skills didn't either, that's why there's a \"robot\" as a character, not anything that would make sense.)\n\nThe final version is not really super fun or anything, but I'm pretty happy with what I could achieve this time around. It could use much more work on the moving and digging etc., but what 48h game doesn't. If I had more time, I would've made the goals more clear and added lot more to do (achievements etc. too), now it's quite an empty/pointless place.\n\nTech: Tried to go with flash+flixel, but soon it came apparent that you can really do just one time of a game with flixel, so this is all custom as3. The crappy graphics were done with Paint.Net, Flash CS4 and Corel Painter 11. Sounds sfxr, of course. I wish I could do music, it would've given the game a much better ambience.\n\nBut anyway, that's it, try it out and leave comments. Thanks.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/f86a6e2d8d32ed64233116b7cba8c286.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-16/?action=preview&uid=78","author":{"name":"gimblll","uid":78,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/219dfc5d83bdc7b28a3c75585613b1ea?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/gimblll/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/78-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/11816/78-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.kongregate.com/games/gimblll/tree"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.kongregate.com/games/gimblll/tree"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.students.tut.fi/~honkala/tree_source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":32},{"area":"fun","rank":20,"score":3.27},{"area":"innovation","rank":23,"score":3.5},{"area":"graphics","rank":28,"score":3.52},{"area":"overall","rank":28,"score":3.3},{"area":"audio","rank":44,"score":2.62},{"area":"humor","rank":48,"score":2.43},{"area":"community","rank":54,"score":3.19},{"area":"theme","rank":59,"score":3.39}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":16,"title":"Oblivious -the darkness within-","category":"compo","description":"A \"maze crawler\" game.
