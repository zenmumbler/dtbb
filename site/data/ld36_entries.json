Generally, I'd prefer if you wrote your feedback based on the post-Jam one. ^^'","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c042cc5db24af9df409b007aa2dba073.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=39564","author":{"name":"Alphish","uid":39564,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a5cd08ea0b3da3b5b86d2cd73f50777a?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/sunflower/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/39564-shot0-1472522029.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/39564-shot0-1472522029.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows (post-Jam)","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/39577640/Jam%20games/The%20Great%20Sphinx%20Pyramid%20-%20Post-Jam.zip"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/39577640/Jam%20games/The%20Great%20Sphinx%20Pyramid.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Trojan Horse","category":"jam","description":"Capture the flag until the time runs out.\n\nControls:\nWASD - Move.

Though a bitter succession war reduced their great cities to rubble, it is said that fragments of their ancient technology still lie buried deep beneath the earth...\n\nAlas, all this is little concern to Pan-Terra Mining Corporation, a conglomerate that sees the Empire's ancient ruins as little more than an obstacle to the valuable mineral deposits buried underneath. You are an intrepid archaeologist who has discovered the location of a cache of priceless Akrasian artifacts - unfortunately, Pan-Terra is preparing to strip-mine the location, destroying the artifacts in the process. Dig deep, dig fast, save as many artifacts as you can, and find a way out before the beam reaches you...\n\nKeyboard and gamepad controls supported. Arrow keys (or d-pad/analog stick) to move around and aim your shovel, Z (or A) to dig.\n\nCollecting five artifacts of the same color will give you a powerup:\n\nBuster (Red): A matter-rending weapon, once the bane of the Empire's enemies, now a powerful excavation tool in your hands. Fire it with X (or B) to instantly dig a hole five layers deep.\nShovel (Gray): Is it nanomachines? Strange temporal mechanics? A long-lost energy drink recipe? However it works, for ten seconds you will be able to dig more quickly through stubborn rock and stone.\nSlowdown (Purple): Pan-Terra's mining beam takes time to eat through the ground. With this powerup, time is on your side: the ever-accelerating beam will be slowed down somewhat, giving you more breathing room to collect artifacts and find an exit.\n\nThese artifacts aren't the only remnants of the Empire's technology you will find: there are still-functioning teleporters in the form of glowing yellow-and-green tesseracts which will take you far away from the encroaching beam, artifacts safely in tow. But how much is enough? Do you take the first exit you find, or do you delve deeper, risking incineration for the sake of greater treasure? The choice is yours...just don't let the beam catch you, or all your work will be for naught!\n\nDeveloped with ZeroBrane Studio.\nGraphics created with Aseprite.\nSFX created with Bfxr and Audacity.\nMusic created with FL Studio.\n\nSpecial thanks to all my playtesters for their feedback!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c6bb8737212600b64fa2309f35dd32e3.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=12635","author":{"name":"Ryusui","uid":12635,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/41dd065fd95f951ee3c7f17c2b83bc80?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/ryusui/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/12635-shot0-1472602184.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/12635-shot0-1472602184.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/12635-shot1-1472602184.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/12635-shot1-1472602184.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/12635-shot2-1472602184.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/12635-shot2-1472602184.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/12635-shot3-1472602184.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/12635-shot3-1472602184.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Love2D (Cross-Platform)","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74940256/EverDown-LD36.love"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74940256/EverDown-Windows-LD36.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","mac","linux","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Farming Sim BC","category":"jam","description":"​Warning: contains pixel nudity\n\n\nThe theme for ludum dare 36 was ancient technology, so I decided to make a game about one of the first farmers!\n\n\nControls are customisable but defaults are:\nSpace - Use item\nShift - Cuss at weeds\nCtrl - drop/pickup item\n\n\nTools used: Unity, Audacity, lmms & Gimp.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/13338046687f5ce1d45df44f5069b7fe.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=34841","author":{"name":"asteryz","uid":34841,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a08823ca7bb0201b6605308bb0cd4612?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/asteryz/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/34841-shot0-1472431739.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/34841-shot0-1472431739.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/34841-shot1-1472431739.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/34841-shot1-1472431739.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://asteryz.nl/farming-sim-bc"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://asteryz.itch.io/farming-sim-bc"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://asteryz.nl/farming-sim-bc/source.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Geomorph","category":"jam","description":"My intention was to create a little platformer game where, after you get 'cursed' trying to unveil the mysteries of an ancient tomb and transformed into some kind of egyptian relics of different shapes and properties, you try to reach the end of the tomb using your new abilty to change your shape to get your normal appearance and maybe discover who's buried there...\n\nThe game is not finished yet.\n\nCONTROLS:\nW, A & D : Move the character arround.\n←↑→ (ARROWS): Change character's form.\nSHIFT: Use character's special abilty (form dependant).\n\n\nTODO:\n\n* Fix pyramid dash.

Just click on the game window and press the corresponding movement key once to stop it.\nI also recommend to use the downloads instead of the web version, because it has some problems with the sound.\n\n---\n\n\nThis is my first Ludum Dare game and my first finished game at all. It is a small point and click adventure where you control Roby the steam-robot. Moving ist done by WASD and Space, interacting with the mouse: left-click for picking items or interact with stuff, right-click for inspection (most of the time).  \n\nThe game is made with Godot Engine 2.1, asesprite, Krita and bfxr. I also used a (public domain) font from http://www.fontspace.com/lcd-solid/lcd-solid.\n\nSo the graphics are OK, I think. Since I'm not an artist, I did a good job in creating those items and things (which was surprisingly much work). The code is a mess. Don't look at it. \n\nThere is a bug that the text window is above the grass. I couldn't fix it in time. It is rarely noticable, though. Also due to the lack of time (and being exhausted) there is sadly no music. But there is sound. Talking of that, Godot Engine has some problems with playing samples (huge delay between issuing the play command and the sound being played). I tried to improve that by reducing the latency, but that can cause problems (it doesnt for me, but who knows what other computers do). If it is weird and annoying, or you just dont like it, you can mute the sound with the small button besides the inventory.\n\nThe Mac and Linux builds are not tested by me. I don't know if they will work. \n\nOne last word: Since english isn't my native language, there may be some weird sentences in the dialogues. I really hadn't the time to read through all of that again.\n\nSo have fun, and please leave a comment! \n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/2011bbbbdd717eb3e1e02b5e9b405a6d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=110745","author":{"name":"lonesurvivor","uid":110745,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cf540ed9ee341e8b2f5fa786c228b4c2?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/lonesurvivor/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110745-shot0-1472433189.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110745-shot0-1472433189.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110745-shot1-1472433189.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110745-shot1-1472433189.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://lonesurv1vor.itch.io/roby-robot"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://lonesurv1vor.itch.io/roby-robot"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://lonesurv1vor.itch.io/roby-robot"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://lonesurv1vor.itch.io/roby-robot"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/lonesurvivor/LD-36"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Run Slave","category":"compo","description":"Run Slave! is a game developed by me for Ludum Dare 36 in compo mode.\nThe theme for LD36 was \"Ancient Technology\" and after the brainstorming I made a game about Egypt.\nYou have to play with an Egyptian slave whose master is Pharaoh Yitán, which has made a competition for their slaves. \nThe slave who takes the last stone to the top of the pyramid, will not be executed and will be free forever.\nBut it will not be so easy, because the pyramid has hidden traps to make it funny.\nI'm sure that you will succeed... won't you?","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ad13c5f359c655a16e9eb00e77c96208.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=26215","author":{"name":"spolan","uid":26215,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/001c9feade4bea2d47f28f6aa0a67910?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/spolan/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/26215-shot0-1472423015.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/26215-shot0-1472423015.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/26215-shot1-1472423015.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/26215-shot1-1472423015.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/26215-shot2-1472423015.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/26215-shot2-1472423015.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3jrduV_bcWkUTBoZ25mUXhOOUE"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3jrduV_bcWkUHRZVTc2ZTVfUUE"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Shimagotchi","category":"jam","description":"Shimagotchi is a game where you take care of lives of poor settlers living on procedurally generated island.\n\nThe world lives by itself and you, as a head of village, decide about most important matters.

Maruto, our hero, is the unbeatable fighter of the new century. Such a good fighter he is, that he has killed all the people in the world. Fortunately for our Maruto the time-travel machine was already invented.\n\nIn the search of new challenges it performs a time travel to the ancient past (to 1979 more concretely) with the aim of testing his manliness against other people using the most archaic and virile technology of this time: an embryo of the Z-MACHINE. He sets up a competition in which fighters willing to beat each other must know how to read and write.\n\nUnluckily for our Maruto, only future evil copies of himself enter the competition using the same time travel machine. \n\nTIPS:\nIf some commands does not work as you expected is because this is an embryo of the Z-MACHINE.\n\nEach round is composed of turns of a few seconds. You should perform a command in each turn. \n\nYou can chain several commands if you separate them with “;”\n\nBasic Actions\nWALK: advances one step forward\nMOONWALK: advances one step backwards\nRUN: simply walk faster\nTURN LEFT: turns the hero left\nTURN RIGHT: turns the hero right\nPUNCH : throws a punch (always available)\nPICK: picks an item box (tiles marked with an exclamation point)\nDROP: drops an item (the item goes elsewhere in another universe where, very likely, they will be more useful).\n\nThere are different sort of items you can use when they are in your inventory. \nSome of them can be thrown with SHOOT (SHOOT <ITEM>:  ARRRGGGHHH, CHOCO, GRENADE, RANDOM, SONICBOMB ).\nOthers modify your status and are operative whilst they are in your inventory:\nSHIELD: you are invincible for a period of time\nINVISIBILITY: you are not visible\nRING: the strength of your punch is multiplied\nDIZZY: you ate a poisoned mushroom. It modifies some of your commands\nSNEAKERS: you run faster\n\nMany of them could be dropped of your inventory with DROP.

It's summer, august as a matter of fact. During the hottest of days you're lying on the ground, about to pass out. You ask your grandmother who is standing beside you: \"What did old people do back in the days there weren't any air conditioners?\" Before you can get a clear response you fall asleep. You find yourself in the past, probably some time around the bronze age. You're surrounded by 10 or so people who inform you (and you understand somehow) that they're poor people who've fled from war. Seeking peace and serenity they decide to found their own little town between two rivers. However they also insist that you're a \"wiseman\" who knows many things they will never even imagine. That time flows different for you, one month for them is but a second for you so long as you don't focus on them. Somehow you accept this (this is a dream after all) and decide to rule over your very on ancient kingdom. That is with the ultimate goal of gathering enough resources to build the world's oldest air conditioner!\n\nControls: W-A-S-D and the arrow key control direction. Click on the button in the center of the screen when you're near a forest, ore deposit or river. This will allow you to connect it to your town's network and gather supplies. However your subjects aren't immediately familiar some of your ideas, so you'll have to answer their requests in order to increase their understanding of technology. At the start of the game you may only build camps in forests.\n\nNotes: Only one pump per river.\nEdit: Sorry for Reuploading late. There were several gamebreaking glitches (instant game over and soft locks) that needed to get fixed which I somehow happened to miss.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/08295719bf7c4c3a2d5e2780624ffb57.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=56784","author":{"name":"themadprogramer","uid":56784,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4dffe301c9a015c113d33f6a3fbd5ea4?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/themadprogramer/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/56784-shot0-1472432393.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/56784-shot0-1472432393.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://themadprogramer.itch.io/what-old-people-used-to-do-back-in-the-days-there-werent-any-acs"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://themadprogramer.itch.io/what-old-people-used-to-do-back-in-the-days-there-werent-any-acs"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Ångst-RÖM's RAM Page","category":"jam","description":"Some people don't care that the NSA is watching their every\nmove on the internet.

Until one wheel decided to rebel and start a revolution in the name of freedom.\n\nThis is an endless runner. Jump and send as much cave man out of their platforms as you can.\n\nPress \"space bar\" to jump and again to double jump. Your jump will restart when you touch a platform (no matter where) so use this to traverse the levels and get as far as you can. Exploiting the double jump is part of the secret!\n\nI used Unity as the engine, I made the music tracks on Garage Band, the graphics were drawn on janvas.com and the sound effects were created using bfxr.\n\nI had no intentions of participating in this Game Jam but this idea came to me while I was sleep deprived and found out the theme of this game jam .  I never did an endless runner before so I decided to do it. I only did games with one screen and this was the perfect opportunity to do that. My first idea was to kill the caveman by hitting them in the head but once I saw the physics do their thing I decided that pushing them was way more fun. The way the double jump works is due to the way I had implemented the \"grounded\" state of the ball but I decided to leave it because bouncing from platform to platform is more fun when you can bounce from the sides of the bottom instead of just the top. It also allows you to climb the platforms, so that's cool!\n\nThe game has several endings depending on how many caveman you kill. I was tired Saturday night and didn't want to code so it was fun to me to just write some serious things about sentiment wheels and give the game some flavour. They are overly serious and it was amusing to me.\n\nAnyway, hope you play and enjoy it! If you don't it's fine too. I had fun doing this and it was my first Ludum Dare so I'm happy I actually did something.\n\nPS: The game does not scale to fullscreen but I couldn't disable that on itch.io page.

You can invert the swipe directions, too!\n\nTips:\n-A gush of wind upwards with leaves means that your next swipe up may cause some items to be thrown upwards!\n-Sometimes you will come across an impassable gate. It has a combination of arrows under it - you need to swipe in the order the arrows appear for the game to open, and you need to do that above the dotted line.\n-Don't go too fast. You'll most definitely die if you do. Doesn't matter if you go slow, just keep your pace and you should be fine.\n-Please don't play with a touchpad :P The ideal situation is playing on a touchscreen, but it works with a mouse as well.\n\nAll of the art assets were painted by me.\n\nMost of the programming was done by me - except for the touch assets that I always use - touch controls are kind of too hard for me to program in a timely manner.

Religions rise and fall over the scattered fragments of data that they can gather.\n\nOne such religion has as its most holy relic an ancient storage device with a single commandment inscribed on its face: \"Colin's Stuff - Do Not Touch\". They do not have the means to read it, and intend to ensure that nobody ever does...\n\nBut now, a heretical sect has discovered another artifact, one with a 3.5\" slot in its face, and a war for control of the sacred disk seems inevitable...\n\n============\n\nWASD to move\n\nRight mouse aims, which also slows your movement\n\nLeft mouse fires while aiming\n\n============\n\n** Update **\n\nI have updated the build on itch.io with fixes for a couple of minor visual glitches:\n\n  * The end-game level had loads of artifacts when running with a vertical resolution of 1200. There may be similar issues at other resolution, but that's the one I noticed.\n  * Removed the weird semi-transparent background behind the health meter. It was supposed to be transparent, and I didn't realise it was visible until I was taking screenshots.\n  * Also added a quit option, and an in-game pause menu with an option to quit to menu. I hate having to force quit jam games!\n\nThat is all, post-jam version with new features soon I hope!\n\n============\n\n** Update 2 **\n\nPost-jam version now available!\n\nhttp://gamejolt.com/games/write-only/184615\n\nI tried to balance things a bit better - health pickups, slower bullets, lower firing rates for the enemies... Hopefully it is a bit less challenging now. I also added some new effects and fixed a couple of minor bugs that didn't get fixed in the previous update. Probably there are still lots of bugs though, so tread carefully.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/1d7d57ba6f83884fd88fb1db70a380e7.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=56477","author":{"name":"randomhuman","uid":56477,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/95b7557b2dbc5330078157ce07e821a3?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/randomhuman/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/56477-shot0-1472524891.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/56477-shot0-1472524891.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/56477-shot1-1472522178.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/56477-shot1-1472522178.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/56477-shot2-1472522178.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/56477-shot2-1472522178.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/56477-shot3-1472524891.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/56477-shot3-1472524891.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://randomhuman.itch.io/write-only"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://randomhuman.itch.io/write-only"},{"label":"Post-Jam","url":"http://gamejolt.com/games/write-only/184615"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"ZXWings","category":"jam","description":"this

When the face is blue it's your turn, when the face is red it's the enemies turn. Each turn lasts 5 seconds.\nTo attack, choose one person of your team by clicking and hold the AWSD keys to choose the attack you are going to use. Click again to use it. Each attack works in a different way and person has different abilities.\nIt's very fast paced and difficult. I'm thinking of implementing a feature that if a teammate dies in a fight you can no longer use him. But it's already hard enough.\nIf bugs happen in the combat mode, press R to restart.\n\nThe game can be overwhelming at first, you need to be very fast and not knowing your moves makes you spend more time. Every enemy and character has 50hp. Here is a list of all the moves:\n\nEveryone:\nS: Moves. Click on a spot to move your character there.\n\nBlue guy:\nA: Shield. Click and every enemy attack in the next turn deals a fifth of damage. Stays on the spot and without doing anything until the next turn.\n\nW: Fire. Click and a circle of fire surrounds the character, dealing 20 dmg everytime it hits.\n\nD: Sword. Short range attack with a sword. Click to attack in the direction you clicked and deal 15 dmg.\n\nGreen guy:\nA: Bomb. Shoots a bomb that explodes on the place you clicked. Deals 20 dmg.\n\nW: Goo. Shoots a goo in the direction you click that makes the enemy not move or attack for 8seconds during his turn.\n\nD: Arrow. Shoots an arrow in the direction you click, dealing 10dmg when it hits.\n\nRed girl:\nA: Knives. Shoots 3 knives in the direction you click, each dealing 5dmg.\n\nW: Healing. Click and an healing spot appears, healing every character that touches it to maximum health.\n\nD: Whip. Long range attack in the direction you clicked, dealing 10dmg. \n\n\n\nHave fun! I spent too much time on the combat system, because I really wanted a proof of concept for it. But I hope you like it!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/0395290ed7d356f490f73ba9208961c8.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=14205","author":{"name":"Zccc","uid":14205,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/507479161c141ed6524b63044b0da38d?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/zccc/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/14205-shot0-1472416447.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/14205-shot0-1472416447.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://jccc.itch.io/mysterious-expedition"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Ruins of Trololo","category":"jam","description":"You are a guy who search treasures in ruins (yep, like Indiana, and you have a whip too..

We let the version without checkpoints up as well, for those who like some more challenge. The checkpoint mechanic is a really simple one and there is no visually indication that you reached a checkpoint. We hope, this keeps the frustration level a bit lower. :D\n\nControls:\n=========\n“A” or “left” - move left\n“D” or “right” - move right\n“W” or “up” - jump or climb ladders up\n“S” or “down” - climb ladders down\n“Enter” or “Space” - interact with levers\n\nTo execute the jar file, you need Java 8 installed on your machine. It was tested on Windows and Linux.\n\nGame Description:\n=================\nYou and your friend are adventurers who want to enter an old medieval tower. It is said that there lie ancient artifacts, but also you’ve been warned of the dangers of the tower.\n\nNonetheless you go for the tower. You feel strange as you stand before it. It appears tall and mighty and you kinda feel attracted to it. Your friend, as well, seems to have these feelings. Excited for the ancient artifacts you approach the tower.\n\nAs you enter the tower you suddenly blackout…\n\nWaking up, you look around and try to find your friend. You don’t see anybody, just a room and some way up.\n\nYou stand up and try to move ahead, but.. you can’t. Some strange power hinders you of all movements.\n\nSuddenly your body moves on its own, you have the strange feeling that your friend controls you with his own movements.\n\n-----\n\nIn this game you control two heroes at the same time. You have to get to the top of the tower and discover the ancient artifact that awaits you.\n\n\nAbout us:\n=========\nTeam members:\nMatjes\nSkosnowich\n\nHello there, we are two guys who participated in the Ludum Dare for the first time. We did all of the programming using Java and libGDX. The music was generated by http://abundant-music.com and then polished in LMMS. For sound we used http://www.bfxr.net/. We found most of the graphics on http://opengameart.org/ and did small parts ourselves. \n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/5cf658f42adb95e5c749917284892dad.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=110460","author":{"name":"Skosnowich","uid":110460,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3b93de4620f281d9e1820430b13e1cbc?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/skosnowich/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110460-shot0-1472503343.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110460-shot0-1472503343.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110460-shot1-1472503343.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110460-shot1-1472503343.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110460-shot2-1472503343.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110460-shot2-1472503343.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110460-shot3-1472503343.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110460-shot3-1472503343.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Jar - Dropbox - 1.1.0","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/fttyb1umlzijbsf/The%20Ancient%20Tower-1.1.0.jar?dl=0"},{"label":"Jar - Dropbox - 1.0.0","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/xw9349wawovcirr/The%20Ancient%20Tower.jar?dl=0"},{"label":"Jar - itch.io","url":"https://skosnowich.itch.io/the-ancient-tower"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["java","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Topkek","category":"jam","description":"Explore the world of Topkek the aztec (or well, a tiny bit of it) and make your way through the underground dungeon, adventure awaits!\nAt first he wasn't meant to be the main protagonist but you guys know what happens when you're putting too much on your agenda ;) \nAnyway, enjoy the 0,1% of what we originally wanted to do, please rate and comment.\n\nThanks for playing :)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b01c52fa0c0b576495848667c525e496.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=111264","author":{"name":"Fat Penguin","uid":111264,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/47f3e90115984ebd960a3dff47858337?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/playingpenguin/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111264-shot0-1472509299.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111264-shot0-1472509299.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111264-shot1-1472509299.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111264-shot1-1472509299.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111264-shot2-1472509299.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111264-shot2-1472509299.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111264-shot3-1472509299.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111264-shot3-1472509299.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://gamejolt.com/games/topkek/184345"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/pzijss1zq9mi64j/Topkek_theGame.exe?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"What the Flag?!","category":"jam","description":"Watch.

In general, I had no idea how to do anything going into this, and now I know a little more.\n\nI really liked the idea of exploring islands and mapping them based on what you see, I just don't have the skills yet to execute it how I really wanted it. I hope to work on this concept more in the future when I'm a little more experienced.\n\nNOTE: Download of the web version (and thus the embedded version) might take a while. Performance of the web version is also a little bad, since it's just using Emscripten. I'd recommend downloading an executable and running from that, but it's probably not even worth it.\n\nLinux and OSX versions in the downloads directory have not been tested at all, I just used Godot's export for everything that made sense.\n\nApologies to Mongo who was hyped for this and I have definitely let him down.

However, this ancient machine is on the verge of collapse, and will need to carefully manage the pieces.\n\nGenerally, how the game works is there is a 3x3 grid of tiles, and two tiles are connected if their adjacent edges are the same color. You must keep a \"spark\" moving between tiles as you work to unlock the vault door. To do this, you will need to careful turn, move and otherwise manipulate the board to create a path for the spark. The tiles will be destroyed over time, and the board will be harder to manipulate.\n\nThe hastily written rules are included in the zip, as well as images to use for the game pieces. Sadly, I did not have time to make images for the cards, so you need a normal set of playing cards for them.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/09401b69e6d1efaec8ca83905a3214da.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=18463","author":{"name":"sockfolder","uid":18463,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/53e1993146a3b56e53db0913b6f29f5a?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/sockfolder/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/18463-shot0-1472434309.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/18463-shot0-1472434309.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/18463-shot1-1472434309.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/18463-shot1-1472434309.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/18463-shot2-1472434309.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/18463-shot2-1472434309.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/18463-shot3-1472434309.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/18463-shot3-1472434309.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Zip File","url":"http://justmillingaroundonline.com/LD36/VaultOfRaza.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Voxel of Evil","category":"compo","description":"How To Play :\n\nArrow to move\nHold LEFT Ctrl to Aim\n(While holding CTRL LEFT) Press Space to shoot\n\nThe game is absolutely not complete.\nLike a lot of people I lost track of time and sent this very unfinished compo entry  !","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e8464dff569468c3340769391678255a.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=8436","author":{"name":"Eniimal","uid":8436,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/97b58e8854380cdef1406b9279853ff4?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/enimal/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/8436-shot0-1472434630.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/8436-shot0-1472434630.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/8436-shot1-1472434630.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/8436-shot1-1472434630.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/8436-shot2-1472434630.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/8436-shot2-1472434630.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://eniimal.itch.io/voxel-of-evil-ld"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"You Invented Fire","category":"jam","description":"This is an arcade style protection game.

When you harvest a plant, you will get the fruit added to the front of your inventory. If your inventory overflows, overflowing items will be deleted. \n\nPressing Z will plant the last item in your inventory. Each plant takes a slightly different time to grow all of its fruit. When all of its fruit have been grown it will start to lose fruit, and eventually die. \n\nPlants grow at a slightly accelerated rate on the far half of the map.\n\nThe stone baby will need food, the food it needs is displayed above the altar. If a fruit is solid that means it needs that fruit. \n\nYou can give it the last fruit in your inventory by pressing X near the altar.

NiceAlexanderAS\n“La broza” is in spanish. “broza” means a bunch of leaves,  sticks, plants and other related organic material that is accumulate in one area. \n\nTheme: It was about ancient technology left behind by humans to restore the planet to its original natural state.\n\n..:: Basic Idea ::..\n\nStrategy game\nCollect all the trash on the map using your robot worker drons and defend them with robot warrior drons against wild mutants that are multiplying time to time. You win if you clean 80% of the trash. You lose if the mutants kill all of your workers and you don't have enough resources to make another one.\n\n..:: Instructions ::..\n\nThe instructions are inside the game but here is a copy (:\n\n(1) Selecting and moving: Left-click to select a unit. To select multiple units\nhold \"left-click\" and move the mouse to form a green selection square.\nAny unit inside the selection square is going to be selected.  \nUse the WASD keys to move on the map.\n(2) Command a selected unit: \n\t* Worker Drone: \"Right-click\" to the trash on the ground\n\tand he will automatically collect the trash.\n\t* Warrior Drone: The Warrior Drone automatically attacks\n\tthe closest enemy but he is not going to move. You move\n\tthe drone by \"right-click\" to a location.\n(3) How to win?: 80% of the trash is gone. Little blue icons show your\nprogress.\n(4) How to lose?: Mutants destroyed all your workers and you don't have\nresources to make more.\n(5) Resources: Little yellow icons indicate how many drones can you create. This icons are call \"Tickets\". \nYou get Tickets by collecting trash. The amount of trash for a ticket is hidden.\n(6) Create a Unit: There are 2 yellow buttons on the bottom-right of the screen, one to build\na warrior and one to build a worker  You need 1 \"Ticket\". They spawn in the main building.\n(7) The buildings are decorations.\n(8) Mutants spawn on big mutant buildings, you can destroy them.\n\n..:: Requirements and instalation ::..\n\nLinux\n     You need SDL2 … thats it I guess\n     Extract EVERYTHING from the zip\n     Run the binary file: LaBroza\n\nWindows\n     Extract EVERYTHING from the zip\n     Run: LaBroza.exe\n\n..:: Tools and libraries used ::..\n\n- Programing language: C++\n- Library: SDL2, SDL2_Image, SDL2_Mixer\n- Editor: Atom\n- Compiler: g++\n- Audio: Audacity\n- Images: GIMP\n- Recorder: SimpleScreenRecorder (that is the name)\n\n..:: Notes ::..\n\n- This is not a finish product, the game has a lot of bugs, missing sounds and needs more gameplay experience (i guess good enough for the moment). \n\n- I plan to continue this game, the idea is really good for me. The main idea is bigger than this. The problem was that i got stuck programming basic stuff and i had to \"cut\" the game to make it playable.\n\nVersion of this game: Pre-pre-pre-Alpha\n\n- Bugs:\n     * Units can merge, there is no unit collision or alignment.\n     * A warrior can shoot in different directions\n     * If you select a bunch of mixed units, there is no way to separate them.

The intention was to subtract from RTS all the elements of deciding where your units need to go. This would be all handled automatically.\n\nThe goal is to be the first one to build a pyramid. You just have to create the right units at the right moment. Very simple.\n\nThe mechanic is a little obscure, and you might lose at first. But, eh, isn't it what video games are about? Observe carefully the AI to understand what needs to be done... Also that balancing is definitely not perfect. Tweaking it is very tricky and is taking quite some time.\n\nThis is my very first Ludum Dare and actually my first game jam in general. This experience was extremely intense but very rewarding.\n\nHope you appreciate it! \n\nNote: You can scroll left and right when the mouse on the edge of the window.

The first, is the retro style of the game (like it would have run on \"ancient technology\"), you will notice the games very low resolution (160x120). The second, is the crossbow, and the portal, the story behind the game: You are a man who is destined to protect the portal for his life, because \"ancient technology\"(the brown boxes around the portal) are used to stop the demons coming through, however they are faulty, which is why you have to be there, to stop the \"few\" monsters that come through from becoming a lot! Your crossbow is ancient, and made to kill these particular monsters.\n\nHow to Play----------------\n\nControls:\nWASD to move, mouse to look, space to jump, mouse button 1 to fire bolt.\nEscape to pause (there is a pause menu of sorts).\n\nStrafe jumping:\nback when I didn't know what the game was going to be, I implemented strafe jumping, turns out it works quite well. First of all, just jumping makes you go faster, if you hold down space while moving, you will move faster.\n\nhowever what makes you go really fast is holding down \"space\", \"w\" and one of the strafe keys (\"a\" or \"d\"). If you hold these down, you will actually ACCELERATE (watch the speed meter), this is key, in avoiding all the monsters, it works very good for quick getaways, and makes you move more (in order to avoid the holes in the floor). The speed increment slows down after around 70, however, it still increases, technically you can get infinite speed!!\n\nTHE TUTORIAL IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE EASY: The tutorial is a strafe jumping tutorial, it is not supposed to be easy, if you cannot do it, then just go back to the menu (via escape) and click on PlayWithNoTutorial. The strafe jumping tutorial is in order for you to improve, so you can get a higher score.\n\nThe portal WARNING--------\n\nAs soon as you collide with the portal, a message comes up.\nWhen this message comes up, the enemies have STARTED SPAWNING!\n\nFinal Words--------\n\nThank you for playing, and reading this description.\nI hope you enjoy, and it would mean a LOT if you could post your scores down in the chat, as I find it very interesting :).\n\nThanks again,\n\nNed\n\nEDIT------\n\nI just found out, if you shoot an arrow, and jump at the same time, you get a boost. I didn't actually know this, but it's awesome :D :D","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/fb9c1131ab2d727a4f364440de61fd6d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=28575","author":{"name":"Nnnnneeeedddd","uid":28575,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/849e114dad77f2e5998faf23cea39372?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/nnnnneeeedddd/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/28575-shot0-1472433897.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/28575-shot0-1472433897.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/28575-shot1-1472433897.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/28575-shot1-1472433897.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/28575-shot2-1472433897.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/28575-shot2-1472433897.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/28575-shot3-1472433897.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/28575-shot3-1472433897.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Jar(Only tested on Windows)","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/download/b50xecsg84ggxf6/LD36.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/download/f9cfqn20btwr722/LD36SOURCE.zip"},{"label":"PostCompo (adds diffuse lighting)","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/download/4kminepm0a8p2dd/LD36RunnableWithDiffuse.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["java","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"ARWeather","category":"jam","description":"*.apk downloadable only*\n\nAR Weather Game!\nWhat ancient technology is utilized by the Earth and humans?

Riders, on highly customisable and tunable mammoths, who competed in crazy illegal races.\n\nPrepare to experience the ancinet tuning technology. Join the riders and tune your mammoth for speed with our global ranking leaderboard.\n\n\n============= Concept =============\nRacing game where you can race the world’s best time saved on our server and tune your mammoth. You get a new tuning part every time you cross the finish line untill you have unlocked everything. This represents our version of possible ancient racing and transportation.\n\nYou can also select from three different mammoth types. Every mammoth type has its own parameters which determine how fast it can go (Top speed), how fast it accelerates (Acceleration), how sharp it turns (Handling) and how effective is its stopping power (Braking). Each tuning part modifies these stats and therefore you can have the most awesome mammoth that ever walked the face of the earth.\n\nBe sure to enter your nickname because we plan to have a leadderboard and announce the fastest racer on our twitter @lonelyvertex on September 14. If you want, you can insert your twitter name in a format “@your_twitter_name” and we will mention you in the winner announcing tweet.\n\nAlso we will be happy if you tweet us a screenshot of your mammoth, praise or a bug.\n\n\n============= Controls =============\n== Menu (Cave) General buttons ==\nMouse click on buttons in the menu:\n - Floppy disk ……………………............

Next this is a game about timing and strategy. The idea behind this game is simple but executing the task isn't. You have acquired the ancient skill of Fire setting where you light a fire in a cave to heat it up then throw water on it to break the rock and get the gems. I have altered it just a bit by taking out the water part and making is so you have to click the gems as the come off the rock. You can then sell the gems for money. Your goal is to get 2.5 million in cash to win the game but wait there are 2 things in your way. cave ins and gem chances. The longer the fire is on the higher the chance for a cave in but the better chance for more valuable gems. You have to ways to combat this, one turn off the fire overtime the chance will go down, the chance for a more valuable gem will too. You can also spend 10k to automatically take away 5% from the current chance of a cave in.\n\nIs the reward great enough you will have to find out.\n\n***Note: If you exit the game you have to start over just to make it a bit harder.***\n\nGame Play from start to finish is about 12 minutes.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a3299b0451577a95a3ca065c04480b96.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=111514","author":{"name":"Ieyfo","uid":111514,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/445dd1228bd9c5c00e94b7c85c004155?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/ieyfo/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111514-shot0-1472431174.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111514-shot0-1472431174.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111514-shot1-1472431174.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111514-shot1-1472431174.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111514-shot2-1472397465.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111514-shot2-1472397465.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111514-shot3-1472431174.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111514-shot3-1472431174.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://ieyfo.itch.io/fire-setting"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://www.mediafire.com/?prwgqv3happq059"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"G-Tech","category":"jam","description":"G-Tech is a small game about shooting ships in an archipelago.\n\nThere is a small campaign with increasing difficulty from level to level.\n\n(Please note that there is a known bug in this version.

All assets made by us (excluding a font used to save time right at the end of production—DKNorthumbria.) We originally wanted to use the prompt as discovery of the wheel, fire, and knots, but in the end only the wheel actually made it into the game. Hmmm. Maybe we were a bit too ambitious?\n\nFeatures:\n• Press E to interact with some of the things!\n• Press F to access a crafting menu/inventory that definitely doesn't contain items we scrapped last-minute!\n• Press space to access the dumbest jumping frame of all time!\n• Press something to attach wheels to the block so it can go up slopes! (To be honest, I'm still not sure how that happens. It just does.)\n• Press escape to access a pause menu that does things!\n• Look at a rope that you can't climb down or up!\n\nKnown Issues:\n• Sometimes the game just crashes and we have no idea why. Closing it and relaunching it sometimes helps.\n• Menus tend to overlay on each other rather than covering each other up.\n• Muting on the main menu doesn't keep you muted in-game. But muting in-game will keep you muted when you go back to the main menu..?\n• You can totally get stuck on the dumbest jumping frame of all time if you jump and land on the pixel-wide ledge to the left of the cave.\n• There are things in the crafting menu that you can't use because we didn't implement them, and I couldn't be bothered to redraw the UI...\n• The block is meant to stop at the first slope unless it has wheels, but it turns out it only stops at the cliff. This is easy to fix, but takes time we don't have.\n• I never actually told Pachops that the background colour was meant to change when you dropped into the cave, so now it's really sunny underground for some reason. Oops.\n• Crafting two pegs makes the game completely unbeatable, as you need a stick to craft wheels and there are currently only five available sticks, yet for some reason neither of us thought to put a cap on the number of pegs you can craft.\n• The music doesn't loop. I assume this was intentional on Pachops' part, but I don't remember him telling me that he was scrapping that feature (and I can't ask him now because he's getting some well-earned sleep...)\n\n\nI think that about covers everything! This was our first LD, and one of our first games made as a team (it's certainly my first time making this much art for anything—as a non-artist, I'm really proud of how it's ended up looking, even if my artsy friends are yelling at me for that walk cycle.) We've had loads of fun doing this, even if the last few hours have been really trying and difficult. But hey! We made a game!

You have to find 4 chests with relics of ancient technology. But be aware. It won't be easy! A lot of dangerous warriors from an old tribe are there to protect their treasures. \n\nThe theme of Ludum Dare 36 was \"Ancient Technology\". We were a team of two coders and one for graphics. The game was written in Haxe using HaxeFlixel and offers keyboard or game pad controls (see below). Sounds have been created using SFXR, the tile set and the animations created with aseprite. \n\nThe levels were created using Tiled. The world itself is created procedurally by patching different level segments together in an top-down approach.  \nEvery time you start the game, the levels will be different. Also the items are created procedurally by using a list of affixes in combination with item names. This allows an easy generation of different gameplay experiences.   \n\nEverything except for the font and the music was created by our team within the time of the jam. \n\n\nControls (keyboard):\nMove - Arrows\nAttack/Interact - X\nDash - C \nInventory - F\n\nControls (XBox360 game pad):\nMove - Left Thumb\nAttack/Interact - A\nDash - X\nInventory - Y","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/5a262d5be633ceeba6ad223114468f61.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=29172","author":{"name":"runvs","uid":29172,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6b8e3d25af60a4e9d0511deeebc8fb24?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/runvs/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/29172-shot0-1472420064.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/29172-shot0-1472420064.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/29172-shot1-1472420064.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/29172-shot1-1472420064.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/29172-shot2-1472420064.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/29172-shot2-1472420064.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/29172-shot3-1472420064.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/29172-shot3-1472420064.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://gamejolt.com/games/raiders-of-the-ancient-technology/183947"},{"label":"Mac","url":"http://gamejolt.com/games/raiders-of-the-ancient-technology/183947"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Stay in Line","category":"jam","description":"Ancient technology is telegraph,\n\nYou must translate morse code in order to give right orders to troops during world war 1 !\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/0de5e53642e4a3a24e37fa75c7572195.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=29406","author":{"name":"louis.denizet","uid":29406,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/682fe325c3f0329ada556f5b5ea629cc?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/louis-denizet/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/29406-shot0-1473420586.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/29406-shot0-1473420586.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/29406-shot1-1473420586.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/29406-shot1-1473420586.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/29406-shot2-1473420586.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/29406-shot2-1473420586.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Youtube","url":"https://youtu.be/Kz50TfdcjIg"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://louis-denizet.fr/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Stay-In-Line.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Surge","category":"compo","description":"Surge is a single player Galagalike game, made in 48 hours.\n| I made all of the artwork, music and game code from scratch.\n\nNote:\n| If anyone experiences any stability/technical issues at all when playing let me know and I will try to patch it ASAP.\n\nStory:\n| An ancient mechanical menace has awoken, and its hell bent on destroying earth.

Try to get to siege without destroying your mighty weapon in the process.\n\nYou'll have to dodge rocks, trees and ancient ruins. You can smash most things, but not without penalty. \n\nAt each juncture, gain a new tower stack for your helepolis increasing the challenge to maintain its structural integrity. But make it to the end intact and victory will be yours!  \n\nI suspect that it is pretty difficult and tricky. I tried to make it easier, but physics is hard to tune correctly. \n\nTips:\n1. When going through the arches, try not to move too much and go right thru the middle. \n\n2. Trees aren't too bad, but try to smash them head on. \n\n3. Try to avoid pillars as much as possible. If you must hit one, just hit ONE. \n\n4. It should only take about a minute and a half to get to the end, but that is if you don't smash into anything. \n\n5. And finally.....you don't actually need all the tower stacks at the moment. I wanted two ends, either one where you get smashed if you don't have enough tower stacks or you smashing the castle. Right now, only the latter is in there, since its hard enough as is. \n\nA LeftArrow = Move Left\nS RightArrow = MoveRight\n\n\nGood luck!\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/74c757ff365e13063659e50def6e8b5a.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=10982","author":{"name":"olkeencole","uid":10982,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ad28b1886bd6673782dc451def9d0b00?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/olkeencole/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/10982-shot0-1472522008.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/10982-shot0-1472522008.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/10982-shot1-1472528513.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/10982-shot1-1472528513.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/10982-shot2-1472528513.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/10982-shot2-1472528513.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22781413/WebGL/index.html"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22781413/LD36/Helepolis_LD36_Win.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22781413/LD36/Helepolis_LD36_Mac.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"innerTemple:episode 1","category":"jam","description":"From the journal of space traveller:\n\n\"After many years of searching I finally found the Ancient Temple, which help open inner Power of awareness, concentration and calm mind...\"\n\n\nTry your self in first episode of journey to inner Power.\n\nUse W,A,S,D or Arrows Keys for movement, Spacebar for jump and Shift for run, Esc for pause.\n\nYou can download game from googleDrive by pressing button in right Upper corner on googleDrive page.\n\nPlease, leave comments.

During these years you should keep the population growing, construct a pyramid for the reigning pharaoh and keep him happy at the same time.\n\nControls:\nMouse or touch.\n\nBasics:\nThe section to the left is organized into twelve rows (representing the twelve months) and four columns (representing work areas). Allocate or de-allocate dice by clicking/tapping on a desired square.\n\nThe first column represents construction of the pyramid. The result of the dice placed in this column will be accumulated as building progress.\n\nThe second column represents farming. Dice placed in the first four rows (the inundation season) will give bonuses to this column for the remainder of the year. Dice placed in the middle four rows (the growth season) will improve growth and result in extra dice for the following years. Dice placed in the last four rows will result in bonuses in random squares of the remainder of the year.\n\nThe third column represents detailing and embellishment of the pyramid. The total detailing can never be higher than the construction progress. If the detailing falls to far behind the pharaoh will be displeased. On the other hand, if the detailing keeps up well with the construction the pharaoh will be pleased.\n\nThe fourth column represent bureaucracy and can result in various positive or negative effects depending on the die rolls and bonuses.\n\nOnce all dice have been placed the Roll button may be clicked to roll the dice. Once rolled the results will be resolved a month at a time, and afterwards one row or choice may be re-rolled. If re-rolled, the row in question and those afterwards will be reevaluated and may result in a cascade of different outcomes.\n\nTechnology:\n - Language: Coffeescript\n - Framework: PixiJS\n - Templating: Pug\n - Modelling: Blender\n - Adjustments: Photoshop\n - Development: Webstorm\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/6d808d0b653d4826af2fad39a93e870b.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=91462","author":{"name":"spacewarp","uid":91462,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d341e83ff458332a7ffb8a260a5cec91?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/spacewarp/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/91462-shot0-1472434654.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/91462-shot0-1472434654.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://spacewarp.se/entry/die-die-die"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://spacewarp.se/files/ld36/spacewarp-ld36-die-die-die-src.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Escape from Alcatraz","category":"jam","description":"Escape from alcatraz!

You only need to know the time of the day (by the position of the Sun, sunrise or sunset) and the Sunstone will find the Sun in the cloud sky. With those two informations (the position of the Sun and if it is after sunrise or before sunset), you can determine the cardinal direction.\n\nTo make this things simple I assumed that the sunrise is always on EAST and sunset always on WEST.\n\nMore info in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXu8hozezOY\n\n==================================================\n===== HOW TO PLAY\n==================================================\n\nYou have 5 minutes (300 seconds) to earn as much points as you can by finding the objective location and delivery goods in the island. You will be rewarded with an option to upgrade your ship speed or a bonus added to the score. Each good delivery gives you 10 points.\n\nControls:\n- Tap or click on screen to move the ship\n\nIn the screen you have the following information:\n- You distance from the center of the screen\n- The Sun position (sunrise or sunset)\n- Your objective, saying the cardinal direction you should go and how far it is\n- The time count down\n- Your current score\n\nYou also have two buttons:\n- Reload, to load a new objective (bottom left button)\n- Sunstone, to open the sunstone and find the Sun location (bottom right button)\n\nUsing the Sunstone:\n- There are two black dots in the Sunstone, when both have the same intensity (see screenshot 2), there is the Sun\n- Based on the Sun location (sunrise or sunset), you can determine if the Sun is pointing to EAST (sunrise) or WEST (sunset)\n- That will be enough for you to find NORTH and SOUTH\n\nSome observations:\n- The Sun position and Sunstone are reset each time you reload or delivery the goods in an island\n- If you get lost, got back to the center of the sea and try again\n- After some time is possible to go to other locations without going back to the center\n\n==================================================\n===== DEVELOPMENT\n==================================================\n\nThis game was developed using cocos2d-x V3.12 and C/C++ in a Mac OS X environment (that's why the Windows build will come later, I'm sorry about that). I used Photoshop for the art, and unfortunately I had no time to create background music or sound effects.\n\n==================================================\n===== BUILDS\n==================================================\n\n- The Android version was tested on a Moto G (version 5.1)\n- The Mac build was tested on a Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.6\n- The Windows build will come later\n\n==================================================\n===== THANK YOU\n==================================================\n\nThank you for playing my game (and read this description). Please, let me know if you found problems or if the instructions here are not clear about the gameplay. I didn't have time to work on music, sound effects, menu and few options like restart the game. \n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/2ae157cd2e0d4dedf0cc8b0d2662f174.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=52021","author":{"name":"cicanci","uid":52021,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/55c33484d39ac7cc69c04a689673f009?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/cicanci/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/52021-shot0-1472432754.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/52021-shot0-1472432754.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/52021-shot1-1472432754.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/52021-shot1-1472432754.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/52021-shot2-1472432754.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/52021-shot2-1472432754.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/52021-shot3-1472432754.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/52021-shot3-1472432754.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Android","url":"https://s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog-gd/ld36/Sunstone.apk"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog-gd/ld36/Sunstone_MAC.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/cicanci/game-cocos2dx-ld36"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["mobile","mac","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"The Polaroid","category":"jam","description":"Inside a mysterious room with no door, you seek a way to get out.

The goal is to kill all of the enemy player's peasants before your own peasants die.  Corpses can also be burned to earn powerful special ammo that destroys the living and dead alike, preventing your enemy from using his dead against you.\n\nIt's meant to be played in about 2 minutes, and it will change over time to speed things along.  If you're having trouble killing the last few peasants, just wait a few seconds and you'll start getting special ammo for free.\n\nThe sprites are a bit messed up on the web build so I encourage you to try the desktop build instead.  Also, the win conditions don't always work right.  Also the AI cleans up his corpses instantly so he's much better at preventing the plague from spreading. Oops!\n\nHere's a video of me playing in case you find it confusing: http://youtu.be/DSYJ6SSLWtI\n\nHere's a link to a higher-res web build: http://picklenerd.com/unity/cataplague/1080/\n\nThis is my third Ludum Dare and I'd love to say something inspiring but I'm just going to go to bed instead.

To keep it safe, a number of mines were buried with it. Fortunately all the mines emit a radioactive frequency strong enough to tell you if one or more are within one dig away from you. Unfortunately, so does the ancient technology. However, the ancient technology emits a stronger frequency which makes it appear that there are more mines nearer to you than what is possible. Using your vast intelligence and logical reasoning skills you should be able to tell it apart from the mines. Find the ancient technology and glory awaits!\n\nTaking a spin on the classic minesweeper formula. The mechanic is pretty much the same, if you see a 1 any adjacent cell that does is not dug up may be a mine. The twist is that it may be the ancient technology too. As you move through a level is something doesn't make sense, e.g. a 3 next to only one covered cell, then you may have found the ancient tech. Dig it up and hope you aren't wrong!\n\nControls:\nWASD or Arrows, digging happens as you arrow or walk into a cell.\n\nNotes:\nUgh! I wasted Friday and Saturday down another path. Minus some tinkering late Saturday night, I created most of this game in the last 12 hours. I'm pretty happy with it given the rabbit hole I fell in.\n\nDue to time constraints I wasn't able to invest time in ensuring every map is winnable. Because the mines are randomly placed there is no guarantee that the tech will not be boxed in by mines. I put in  a small amount of code to attempt to remove the most likely case of this happening, and hopefully you will not encounter this type of situation, but I am sorry if you do :(\n\nTools:\nC#, MonoGame, my own framework hosted openly here: https://github.com/srakowski/coldsteel\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/1f13d595d9028b4f989a65fc1a48ef5f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=26664","author":{"name":"srakowski","uid":26664,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/21d1ff9b3faa8c36d005ab2874974f13?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/srakowski/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/26664-shot0-1472433439.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/26664-shot0-1472433439.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/26664-shot1-1472434878.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/26664-shot1-1472434878.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/26664-shot2-1472434878.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/26664-shot2-1472434878.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/srakowski/LD36/releases/download/LD36/MineSweepinMinerDeluxe.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/srakowski/LD36"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Robotanists","category":"jam","description":"synchronize cute robots  to take care of a forest ad give oxygen to atlantis.\nUse left click to select Robot or Tree (and surprises) and Right click to get back.

Team blue and yellow, but always the team red, the dead, win. Select units from Footmen, Archers, Ballistae, and Catapults, place them anywhere on the battlefield, and watch as they fight to the death. Units can be placed on the battlefield at any time using the following buttons: Q for archers, W for footmen, E for Catapults, and R for Ballistae. Pressing the buttons will place a unit at the position of your cursor. You can switch sides by pressing C somening units for the other side. Begin the game by pressing Space. The game can also be paused at any time by pressing Space again. Once the battle is over and an army has won, end the .game by pressing Alt+F4 (yeah I was short on time! :D) It’s advised to play the game in 1280 x 600 windowed mode(The wider and narrower the better.)

Life just got in the way of this event unfortunately and I've only worked on it for maybe a total of 10 hours.  But enough with excuses, here it is, Alien Artifact...\n\nThe premise of the game is that you've been searching the globe and finding odd tablets with Glyphs on them (cards).  You then find an ancient alien artifact with all kinds of sockets on it.\n\nThat's about as far as I got with any kind of story...\n\nObject of game:\nYou have a deck of 51 cards and are dealt 3 cards each turn.  With 5 Player Points (PP).\n\nFrom the three cards, chose one of them to place in a socket (the grey circles) by clicking on a card and then clicking on a socket.  The other two cards will be removed from the game.\n\nEach card has a PP cost associated with it which is the number in the upper right corner of the card.\n\nAfter placing a card in a socket.  The mechanic on the card you used will apply.  Some will give you a flat amount (#) of Energy (E) or Player Points (PP).  Some will give you +/- E/PP per turn.\n\nIf you run out of PP, the game is over.  If you get 100 energy built up, you will activate the artifact and win the game.\n\n4 sockets will be randomly chosen with a semi random bonus applied.  The Orange ones give you either a flat amount of PP or will increase your PP per turn.  The Blue sockets do the same but for Energy instead.  I initially intended for the bonus socket to have to match the type of card but wasn't able to get to that.  It would also likely have applied the bonus as multiplier of the card inserted.\n\nThat is pretty much it.  It does have a win condition (100 energy) and you can lose so from that perspective I suppose it is complete.  I like the concept here and may built on it later.  Other items I'd like to add/fix:\n\n1)  UI is not properly anchoring as the resolution is changed (so play it in 1024x768 for best results).\n2)  There should be a hover feature on the sockets that have glyphs on them so you can see what the glyph does\n3)  More cards.  There were going to be bad cards in the deck as well such as randomly destroy a glyph but gain a good bonus\n4)  Adjacency bonuses.  All those connectors you see were suppose to be a way to deliver energy to the artifact at the center and also apply certain bonuses to sockets along the same connectors.\n5) Make it so that it isn't so easy to win :)\n6) Randomized Levels or maps loaded from a sprite/text file.\n\nIn any case, most of this is with the compo rules applied.  I'm not 100% that a couple of the sounds I used were originally made by me but I think so.\n\nEngine: Unity\nArt (if you can call it that): Paint.NET\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/8efbc020c518b9905880f9f547c716d4.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=63572","author":{"name":"Simple Potential","uid":63572,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5ace4e7ff09cb42f195b4e34fbbdb660?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/bazkur98/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/63572-shot0-1472499463.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/63572-shot0-1472499463.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/63572-shot1-1472499463.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/63572-shot1-1472499463.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://simplepotential.itch.io/ld36"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-ffmjRLPVRERktWT0xzYVZoVlU/view?usp=sharing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Ancient Temploot","category":"jam","description":"The Ancient temple is filled with traps.

Will be fixed in the Post Jam version.\n•The game fails to preload completely before the first scene, causing slowdown.\n•The particle system and some actions may cause slowdown.\n•The Male-T-Rex has some random animation bugs, revealing that it was skinned over a previous character. :o\n•Interaction with the tree is haphazard at best.\n•Various graphical bugs.\n•There is no real point- at this point.\n•Random spawn and re-spawn system have been removed for this build- will try to include in the PostJam.\n•Shaders and Reflections have been disabled for this build.  A lighting shader can be turned on with Space and a contrast shader can be toggled on with V and off with C.  \n•Other keyboard keys might crash the game.  Testing.\n•Opening the game for the first time?  It may hang, for a good moment.\n•Controller may rumble if plugged in or activated- yet, there is presently no controller support implemented.\n•Full screen on dual monitors?  Your mouse might scroll out of the playable area and effect control.\n\nAdditional code courtesy of Lee Clarke, a.k.a. AFRLme\nSpecial Thanks to the devs at Visionaire; most of all Simon Scheckel!\n\nLet me know what you think, or if you find anything else!\n\n\n*EDIT: POST JAM MAC & WIN VERS*\n\nNew post jam vers, still doesn't have any real game, but maybe feels a little more like a really short one.\n\nCONTROLS:\n\nPoint and Click to WALK/INTERACT\nPoint and Double-Click to RUN/INTERACT\n\nMouse Wheel Scroll Up - ZOOM IN and center on Current Character\nMouse Wheel Scroll Down - ZOOM OUT and center on Current Character\n\nRight Click - ROAR\n\nR - Dev Center on Rex\n\nYour cursor will focus the camera on prey and predators.\n\nThanks so much for waiting and playing!  I will try to get a Linux version up, but if not- at least a gameplay video!\n\njosephmidthun (rat) gmail (rot) com\n\nCopyright 2016 the menshop\n\n#LDJAM","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/4c36438cb60e49fb2cb5e3381a71989f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=92338","author":{"name":"joemid","uid":92338,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/366630c412cbf73480405a4225c4d346?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/joemid/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/92338-shot0-1472523219.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/92338-shot0-1472523219.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/92338-shot1-1472533488.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/92338-shot1-1472533488.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/92338-shot2-1472708405.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/92338-shot2-1472708405.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/92338-shot3-1472708405.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/92338-shot3-1472708405.png"}],"links":[{"label":"WindowsPostJam1","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B44fmTioIFbiMUtRNkpqYzMzQUk/view?usp=sharing"},{"label":"OS/X Orig Jam","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B44fmTioIFbiVDByZGRXNE9JODg/view?usp=sharing"},{"label":"OS/X PostJam1","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B44fmTioIFbiNFo4REpUekpBcE0/view?usp=sharing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["mac","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Abstract Boulder","category":"compo","description":"Two player smashing mayhem.

A group of people is dispatched to research this ancient ship. Unfortunately right as the researchers arrived, ship jumped to hyperspace and to another solar system.\nShip engines (or drive) are powered from Stars.

This is quite hazardous if he's over say a bottomless pit.\n\nControls:\nLeft/Right Arrow Keys: Move left/right\nZ: Jump\nX (hold): Turn air into water\n\nCredits:\nKylemsguy - Code, Music, and Graphics\nZhuowei - Code, Graphics, and Level Design\n\nMusic Used:\nFloating Cities Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) \nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/f818483051d2f28e27263b8504696975.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=50339","author":{"name":"kylemsguy","uid":50339,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c8e888255ce3b7515ca117538b015f63?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/kylemsguy/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/50339-shot0-1472517989.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/50339-shot0-1472517989.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://kylemsguy.com/aquastick/"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/kylemsguy/AncientTech"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"The Beat Device","category":"compo","description":"a drum machine, click to select tiles, then press keys from the menu","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/6f656931366836728c7fc8cd3d2b7d49.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=1066","author":{"name":"jplur","uid":1066,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d3d1c3efc1f744f6caf93f6ed2733c4e?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/jplur/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/1066-shot0-1472438439.gif-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/1066-shot0-1472438439.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://selfsame.itch.io/device"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://selfsame.itch.io/device"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://selfsame.itch.io/device"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/selfsame/ld36"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"The ZIGGURARK","category":"jam","description":"The Explorer wanders in the jungle, when he finds the ZIGGURARK, a weird mix between a Ziggurat and an Ark.\n\nLooking for treasures, he enters the building just to face the mighty Tezcacoatlus, the Assembler God, an ancient supernatural entity which uses a godly ancient tool, (\"The Tool\"), to recombine DNA and create animal hybrids.

As you can guess it's about technology - ancient technologies to be specific. Let me guide you through 'gameplay'. You are guiding a Tribe. In order to be successful keep your eyes on resources and environment. The most important resource is Food. If you're out of it - your tribe will die from starvation. More advanced resources will come later. You have also Children indicator - Idle citizens will make it grow ^^. When it reaches 100%, you'll get another Idle citizen.\nWatch out for environment - if you harm it too much rate as which it regenerates will drop down rapidly. Spend Science to advance in technology. Efficiency is the rate at which one worker contributes to resource he's responsible for (more effective hunter will give more food, and kill more animals at he same time), so total contribution to resource it efficiency * number of workers.Here's Tech Tree if you need some guidance, but you can play without it and explore the game.\n===>(https://s13.postimg.io/nksz1thdj/LD_tech_tree.png)<===\nFor those who does not like surprises I've prepared list of technologies and their effects.\n\n\n===== Technologies: =====\nHunting : easy to guess, - opens new way of acquiring food by your people\nCrafting: lets you craft tools which are needed to upgrade profession\nSettlement: increases breed rate\nAlphabet: increases scientists' efficiency\nFishing: hmm?\nAgriculture: you can now renew berries\nMining: you can now mine yay!\nAnimal Husbandry: start herding animals\nArchery: increases hunters' efficiency\nPottery: lets you hire Potters which increase by small amount food balance (useful in huge tribes)\nThe Wheel: now upgrading profession gives more\nTrapping: yet another hunters' upgrade \nBronze Working: smelt ore to gain bronze - crafters are making more/better tools with it\nMasonry: increases crafters efficiency\nWriting: randomly increases/decreases by up to 20% food consumption and efficiency of all professions\nCalendar: what do you expect? try it!\nSailing: you have more area to fish so the 'fish equation' which renewes fish is more pleasant\nIrrigation: same as Sailing but for berries\nMathematics: you should see more now\nConstruction: increases efficiency for all professions\nCurrency: gives you free resources! spend them wisely\nEngineering: lowers upgrade cost\nIron Working: read Bronze Working and replace bronze with iron\nCartography: 'Sailing for animals'\nDrama and Poetry: lowers food consumption\nPhilosophy: learn something!\nAqueduct: 'Sailing for berries' but on steroids\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nPS: Special thanks to my audience which supported me in my struggles.It's worth mentioning some of them individually:\n* Sim00n - my Guardian Angel in this LD, rented my game a place to live\n* sepiko - great tester! helped track many bugs\n* Oscar5055, Patrix0n, veneficus78, kajman226, rojtarc21, faustNW, kombiusz19995 - been there through my journey till the end!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/26dec367605d563f95a543d3519ff7ec.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=44821","author":{"name":"c2v4","uid":44821,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c2cbf4485e80cda1e930cac979a3d3da?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/c2v4/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/44821-shot0-1472424750.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/44821-shot0-1472424750.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/44821-shot1-1472424750.gif-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/44821-shot1-1472424750.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/44821-shot2-1472424750.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/44821-shot2-1472424750.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/44821-shot3-1472424750.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/44821-shot3-1472424750.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://notavirus.puzdrowski.com/dist/index.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/c2v4/LD36Game"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Ultra Ludum Ancient Fighter Deluxe HD","category":"jam","description":"Ultra Ludum Ancient Fighter Deluxe HD\n=====================================\n\nUltra Ludum Ancient Fighter Deluxe HD is game for 2–4 players about fighting your friends using — guess what — ancient technology!\n\nControls:\nStick: Control\nA: Jump\nX: Attack (when you get a technology)\nB: Dash (when you get dash)\n\nNote: You have to use 2-4 gamepads controllers to play (sorry :/).\n\nDevelopment\n===========\nThis game was developed using Unity3D and C# in a PC environment.

I have used second day for level design and adding arrow mechanics (without them level seam to be to easy) and gluing everything together \n\n\nDescription:\n\n* It is short (6 levels) browser maze game\n\n* You controll everything in labyrinth room with arrows or asdw\n\n* Your goal is collect all tech cards and escape to next floor\n\n* After each floor there is a piece of simple story uncovered\n\nLanguage:\n\n* Javascript\n\nBuild:\n\n* WebGL Canvas\n\nMy tools of choice:\n\n* Bosca ceoil great tool for music and easy to learn http://distractionware.com/blog/2013/08/bosca-ceoil/\n\n* Tiled for mad editing http://www.mapeditor.org/\n\n* Phaser JS http://phaser.io/\n\n* Grunt build manager http://gruntjs.com/\n\n* Brackets editor http://brackets.io/\n\nIf you kind of like it you can help me voting on it on Kongregate: http://www.kongregate.com/games/Xesenix/ancient-maze-of-epla","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/33ec581629fe44fc090559a55bdbc9c2.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=111208","author":{"name":"xesenix","uid":111208,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/264d7bb52024efe30d12845515de13ce?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/xesenix/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111208-shot0-1472426328.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111208-shot0-1472426328.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111208-shot1-1472426328.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111208-shot1-1472426328.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111208-shot2-1472426328.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111208-shot2-1472426328.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111208-shot3-1472426328.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111208-shot3-1472426328.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Kongregate","url":"http://www.kongregate.com/games/Xesenix/ancient-maze-of-epla"},{"label":"Gamejolt","url":"http://gamejolt.com/games/ld36-ancient-maze-of-epla/183791"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/Xesenix/ludumdare-36"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Ancient Periods","category":"jam","description":"Centuries have passed since the last nuclear war.

Try to fill each one as much as possible, once they are at least half-full they can be 'sent' (the button below each box) away.  The more full the board the more points its worth, plus a faster respawn time.  Sending a board comprised of all the same color also receives a points bonus.  Game over occurs once the pieces stop up through the top of the conveyor, but there is a 5 second timer, so if you are able to clear it out you can keep going.  It is tricky to recover once it gets that far though.  Have fun!\n\nThis is my first time participating in Ludum Dare and I had a lot of fun.

","category":"jam","description":"My entry for my very first Ludum Dare (Ludum Dare 36, Ancient Technology Theme.) Abaclickus! Is one part edutainment about the Abacus and one part clicker. Solve increasingly bigger and more complicated math problems while earning money to hiring others to work on Abacuses along side you, or buying cheat tokens to reveal answers to problems that are stumping you, or simply just invest it into earning bigger rewards for solving problems! So dust off your clicker finger, ready your *glances at wikipedia* ...Intraparietal sulcus... And crunch some numbers!\n\nLearn how to use a Abacus here: http://www.wikihow.com/Use-an-Abacus\n\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nTips:\n\n9 on the Numpad will activate Fullscreen.\n6 on the Numpad will activate Windowed\n3 on the Numpad will activate Fullscreen on a integer scale (for all those like me who are using 1440p/720p resolutions.)\nYou can activate cheats and break the game over your knee if you want. I won't tell you exactly, but you need to hit several keys in order to activate (and you'll see a sign that it worked.) The keys are the remnants of a word whose vowels have been removed, and that word is related (if not obvious.)\n\n___________________________________________________________________\n\n~ Why did I made this game ? ~\n\nI was really wanting to participate in a Ludum Dare game jam. And well, to be honest... I hated the theme they landed on for 36. \"Ancient Technology.\"It felt like a very \"aesthetic\" heavy theme instead of a theme that impacted gameplay, and I'm just not really into the cliches of Ancient Greece or Egypt or the stone age or whatever.\n\nBut while discussing this theme with other people I got pointed to the Abacus, a ancient device used for calculating numbers before the numeral system was adopted. I thought about how it for a while, and eventually decided that even though I didn't have an solid idea with how to use it (initially I thought about a cyberpunk game where you use one to hack but that seemed contradictory to the theme, and I didn't have enough time to do something as narrative heavy as my idea for that asked for), I wanted to program a digital abacus regardless. After a day of working on it, I got it functioning.\n\nAfterwards I asked some people if they had any ideas on what to do with a Abacus. And someone, I'm assuming sarcastically, said \"clicker\". But the more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea.\n\n~Will you update the game?~\n\nMaybe? Probably? There are some easy changes I can make. And a friend showed me a few things that opened up the potential of the game being more than it is right now.

Will he/she be able to save the world ? Probably not. But you can still play this short adventure game to discover what happens.\n\n\nHow to play\n-----------\n\n- arrow keys or wasd: move the character.\n- e, space, enter, ctrl: interact and pass dialogs.\n- escape: quit the game.\n\nPlease tell us if you encounter a bug or the game crash.\n\nFullscreen and V-sync are enabled by default. If you want to disable any of them, edit config.json and replace the \"true\" by \"false\" (without the quotes). Be careful, json is really pedantic about the syntax, so if you remove a comma or do a typo, it will fail. However, removing the file should disable both fullscreen and V-sync.\n\n\nUpdates\n-------\n\n2016-08-30: Found a race condition while testing on osx that could cause a crash when entering the second level. Updated the Windows executable. The content of the game is unchanged.\n\n\nHow to run the game\n-------------------\n\nIf you are under Windows and we uploaded a nice .zip with the executable, just download it, extract it and run the .exe. Otherwise, you can compile it yourself, it works on Windows, MacOS X and Linux. See the github page for more informations.\n\nIf you are under osx or Linux and would like an archive with a precompiled version of our game, leave us a comment. It might give us enough motivation to do it !\n\n\nUnimportant notice\n------------------\n\nWe feel compelled to write \"sex\" on this page, because last time a bunch of people found our game by searching for it.

Their happiness is overshadowed by the sheer amazement at the fact that Atlanteans are all robots, and like playing hockey with EXPLODING PUCKS™ and time-manipulating power-ups. What a weird lot.\n\n---------\nNOTE:\n---------\n\nThis is a two-player game! Also you need at least one gamepad! Hook up your favourite controller and bring your favourite friend (or sworn enemy, if you're the kind of person to have one of those) and play a friendly (or enemyly) game of Atlantean Hockey! The rules are simple; score points! Use power-ups! Tackle the other team!\n\nThis game is kind of a long shot theme-wise, but we hope you'll give it a try anyway! c:\n\n---------\nSHORT POST-MORTEM NOTES:\n---------\n\nSo the last LD was the first time we didn't have time for sound effects. This LD we had those, but no time for music. Always something! But at least we did something radically new with this compared to our older entries, which are overwhelmingly about puzzling, problem solving or more or less unhappy subject matters.\n\nThe matches were supposed to be timed and a winner be determined after a few minutes, but there was no time, so now the game simply goes on forever—but it does keep score, so just keep battling it out for as long as you wish instead. Make your own rules! First to 30 points, perhaps?\n\nI am rather amazed at how we continually manage to tie everything up in a SORT OF presentable way last minute every time. It never ceases to be the scariest experience. Throw in all the sound effects during submission hour? Oh, yes!\n\nBugs may exist, but what can you do?\n\n---------\nTWITTERS:\n---------\n\n@avaskoog\n@thedjuske\n@zbegra\n\n---------\nLINKS:\n---------\n\nTwitter reveal if you want to retweet:\nhttps://twitter.com/avaskoog/status/770455471832596480\n\nLD blog reveal:\nhttp://ludumdare.com/compo/2016/08/29/jam-entry-pucketeers-of-atlantis/\n\nYouTube video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC9N19iaF1E\n\nTweet to share video:\nhttps://twitter.com/avaskoog/status/770878328882552832","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a3ab187128154f18d4c8e99fe8660933.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=6155","author":{"name":"Avant-Marde","uid":6155,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bedeab874310ed3b5430b48200a594fb?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/sko/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/6155-shot0-1472521607.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/6155-shot0-1472521607.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/6155-shot1-1472522730.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/6155-shot1-1472522730.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/6155-shot2-1472565063.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/6155-shot2-1472565063.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/6155-shot3-1472565063.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/6155-shot3-1472565063.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://formo.ninja/LD36/webgl/index.html"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://formo.ninja/LD36/windows/PoA_Windows.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://formo.ninja/LD36/mac/PoA_OSX.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://formo.ninja/LD36/linux/PoA_Linux.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Rolin Stone","category":"jam","description":"The second Ludum Dare game made by Clockwerk Clover with the theme \"Ancient Technology.\"\n\nYou take the roll of a stone wheel in this rock solid entry that is sure to revolutionize the platforming genre.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/2cf452a3581a54d75290ad216fc90ed3.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=86401","author":{"name":"ClockwerkClover","uid":86401,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/455ebe667259d139c98ed57ab790142e?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/clockwerkclover/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/86401-shot0-1472514371.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/86401-shot0-1472514371.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://kilted-gnome-games.itch.io/rollin-stone"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://kilted-gnome-games.itch.io/rollin-stone"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"RUINS","category":"compo","description":"RUINS is a simple puzzle game with a single goal: move your Yellow Rock to the green goal.

Keep the Firebox full of coal (F) to heat the boiler. The thermometer indicate the temperature : there is more steam produced if boiler is hotter.\n\nYou can see level of coal in the firebox by looking the dark black level. Same thing for the boiler and the dark blue for the water level.\n\nThe bar on top of the boiler indicate the pression. Press B to send steam to the engine. More pression means more speed. When you send steam to engines, water level in the boiler reduce.\nYou will have to send water in the boiler. Be carefull, adding fresh water will reduce temperature of the boiler. C and V regulates the water flow : 0 means no water is added, 1 means lot of water is added.\n\nThe goal is to stop at all stations (there are 5 of them). Use S to brake. the right counter indicates how far is the next station. When you see the STOP sign, you have to stop the train. Start the train when it vanish.\nTry to finish the game the faster you can !\n\nGood luck !\n\nTips:\n * Wait for enough pression in the boiler to activate engines, it will be more efficient.\n * Go reverse if you missed the station. You have missed a station if the right counter is negative.\n * Always put coal in the Firebox (F key)\n * Try things, it will probably work sometime.\n\n(Actual) Technology used :\n * Haxe\n * HaxeFlixel\n * Staaxe\n * Polom lib\n * Krita\n * Audacity","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/5a38b22a687cef7fd96c244a8afae123.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=484","author":{"name":"Sébastien Bernery","uid":484,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/07683a4eb94195e82908120b3c04d878?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/sebbernery/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/484-shot0-1472422850.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/484-shot0-1472422850.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/484-shot1-1472422850.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/484-shot1-1472422850.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://docs.bernery.eu/gamejam/SteamTrainYoupi/"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://code.vikindie.fr/Sebastien/Train-LD36/tree/master"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Stone Age Rampage","category":"jam","description":"What if the ancients had created amazing technology which we are yet to discover....\nWhat if this technology is used by one clan to overpower the others....\nGet ready to an embark on an adventure where you are the hero and the people of 'Tiny village' are waiting for your help.

My goal was simply to create a working \"finished\" game, which I have problems with achieving normally. I am fairly happy with the structure of my project. Once I had sort of a playable version of the game I made it quite easy to add extra content. Since structure and planning is something i need to work on I feel like I succeded in that part. Well, the planning was abit off. Even though the game sort of works at the moment there is a lot of content that I did not have time to add. For example:\n\n+ Boss Battle\n\n+ More Eras\n\n+ More player interactivity (abilities)\n\n\nAs a conclusion I can say that I am not really that happy with how the game turned out. However, I am still proud of myself that I managed to get something playable in such a short time.

So you know... don't die.\n\nCredits\n--------------------\nArt: Linear\nCode: Aurelinator\nSound: tanbor9 ","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/fcc430268244a4f0c1a71fec54593676.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=25368","author":{"name":"Linear","uid":25368,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/065483a85fc953df40399d818b2f7fb0?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/linear/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/25368-shot0-1472522609.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/25368-shot0-1472522609.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/25368-shot1-1472537534.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/25368-shot1-1472537534.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/25368-shot2-1472527008.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/25368-shot2-1472527008.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/25368-shot3-1472527843.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/25368-shot3-1472527843.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/41613758/final_build2.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"The Temple of Sharaab","category":"jam","description":"Enter the temple of Sharaab, and claim the ancient treasure that lies within!\n\nDodge deadly traps and solve devious puzzles as you descend into the depths of the temple.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/51556105b2e650b37b7ffb6a103673bb.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=15847","author":{"name":"ElliotFiske","uid":15847,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/720d1365094c6be80855fe7e9f0b2f17?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/elliotfiske/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/15847-shot0-1472489081.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/15847-shot0-1472489081.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/15847-shot1-1472540810.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/15847-shot1-1472540810.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/15847-shot2-1472540810.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/15847-shot2-1472540810.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/15847-shot3-1472540810.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/15847-shot3-1472540810.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://thomassteinke.com/Sharaab/"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://thomassteinke.net/Sharaab.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://thomassteinke.net/Sharaab.app.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Underground Repair Inc","category":"jam","description":"Underground Repair Inc.\n\nAs a young dwarven repairman you are tasked with repairing a remote rat infested facility.\n\nNotes:\n\n -

I'm still very happy with the results, but I want to \"complete\" this game, so look forward to it! <3","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/1c02b949f00b5380f65ec7f423e692f5.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=46460","author":{"name":"Karai17","uid":46460,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/450286d1c444f51a3d73f4f3caac5a6e?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/karai17/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/46460-shot0-1472519641.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/46460-shot0-1472519641.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://excessive.itch.io/bird-flapulator/download/Sx7oheWnHf8fIpnFBiTIA1kCKlV33094MsXCL32v"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://excessive.itch.io/bird-flapulator/download/Sx7oheWnHf8fIpnFBiTIA1kCKlV33094MsXCL32v"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Bit Hero","category":"compo","description":"This is my very first Ludum Dare, so my game may not be that good for the compo, but everyone's gotta start somewhere.

The objective is to drop Power Stones, remove them and rotate the board in order to align lines of 3 stones or more and push the opponent off the screen.\n\nControls: Mouse only.\n\nBasics:\n- One line gives 1000 points.\n- Completing multiple lines in one move gives a combo bonus. 2 lines is x1.5, 3 lines is x2, and so forth.\n- \"Denying\" a line to the opponent gives them 750 points with no combo multiplier.\n- Score decreases by 1% (?) per second during a player's turn.\n- A player wins if their score goes 10 000 points over their opponent's.\n- Therefore, to win, one must prioritize line combos while denying the opponent from doing the same.\n\nUploading this from my phone as my PC gave out earlier today. This is the latest build fetched from Windows Safe Mode and should be fully functional, all that was left to do was to draw/add characters and possibly a story mode, and fine-tune the AI.

A few small things slipped by because, even though I had a spare hour to tweak and clean things up, I just forgot about them.

The longer the duration and the higher the treachery rating, the more likely it is that something bad happens to you.\n\nAlso, your jockey is invisible because we didn't have time. Also, it probably is inaccurate to call him a jockey but I mean. You're a horse.

The game and screenshot may have minor differences. \n \nCandle Dungeons is a game where you explore treasure Dungeons with your trusty candle. You have 15 seconds with each wick, collect Yellow Coal cubes to extend you light time. How much time of light you have left is displayed next to the player. Each coal provides 15 more seconds of light. Use the arrow keys to move , Space to jump, and ENTER key to open doors. Doors could only be used once. Also this game is in need of a post combo update which I will do tomorrow. Right now this game has only one level, and no Menu screen, no enemies. But don't worry, I'll include those in the update tomorrow. So drop by again tomorrow to see whats new.\n\nIf you have a idea for improvement ( besides for what is in the update ) or found a bug, please let me know in the comments.

This is my fifth LD entry. Ancient Technology seemed like a pretty wide-open theme, but as I'm sure many people did, I immediately started thinking about Ancient Egypt and wanted to dream up some fantasy machinery for that era. As for the game type, I had a memory of a similar \"peg\" game that I built out of wooden dowels and ping pong balls with my brother when I was young. From Plinko to Peggle, I've always liked those sorts of games, so I decided to fit a new one into the theme!.. In as silly of a way as I could come up with.\n\nMummyDrop was developed using the following tools/resources:\nGameMaker Studio Pro 1.4 (with HTML5 export)\nBFXR sound generator\nAudacity audio editor\nMSPaint (for that professional touch)\n\nNo pre-existing art, code, or assets were used.\n\nGame features no Egyptian-based puns. They're b'Neith me.\n\nThanks for playing and congrats to all the other entries!\n\nDeclared Post-Dare Bugfixes:\n8-28-16- Had to redeploy all versions due to a potentially game-freezing bug when beating a level.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/3a2a8ea1630c38ab2821b23ba97a3cef.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=30014","author":{"name":"SketchyGalore","uid":30014,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5f6d477b7c779a2332bd837ded1e7bfe?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/sketchygalore/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/30014-shot0-1472432288.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/30014-shot0-1472432288.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/30014-shot1-1472435534.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/30014-shot1-1472435534.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/30014-shot2-1472435534.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/30014-shot2-1472435534.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (Read note at top)","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/45288084/LD%2036/index.html"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/45288084/LD%2036/Ludum%20Dare%2036.exe"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/45288084/LD%2036/MummyDrop%20-%20Source%20Code%20-%20Ludum%20Dare%2036.gmx.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Mummys Day Massacre","category":"jam","description":"Synopsis:\n2-4 bumbling archaeologists have stumbled into the wrong tomb and angered its sleeping inhabitants.

External chat (preferably voice) is highly recommended/necessary to play.\n\nI appreciate that, being multiplayer, it's unlikely to get many plays (hence I created it in the unrated LD) but it would be awesome if a few people could try - let me know on the irc pighead10 or twitter @pighead10 if you have any issues getting this working. \n\nInstructions for playing and setting up the game are inside the client download in the menu screen.\n\nKNOWN ISSUES:\n-Starting client before server (or entering wrong ip, etc...) results in undefined behaviour.\n-Random crashes in client from time to time.

Ludum Dare 36.  Go fishing.  Chill out.\n\nFishing is an ancient technology.\n\nFishing is the activity of catching fish. It is an ancient practice dating back at least 40,000 years. Since the 16th century fishing vessels have been able to cross oceans in pursuit of fish and since the 19th century it has been possible to use larger vessels and in some cases process the fish on board. Fish are normally caught in the wild. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping.\n\nThe term fishing may be applied to catching other aquatic animals such as shellfish, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not usually applied to catching aquatic mammals, such as whales, where the term whaling is more appropriate, or to farmed fish. In addition to providing food, modern fishing is also a recreational sport.\n\nAccording to FAO statistics, the total number of fishermen and fish farmers is estimated to be 38 million. Fisheries and aquaculture provide direct and indirect employment to over 500 million people.[1] In 2005, the worldwide per capita consumption of fish captured from wild fisheries was 14.4 kilograms, with an additional 7.4 kilograms harvested from fish farms.[2]","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/1efa0cdc3c9d0760a8c4cdc53f61b571.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=37205","author":{"name":"godjammit","uid":37205,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9aa9ec60dc5e4082c8dae71ab5b3838?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/godjammit/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/37205-shot0-1472519803.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/37205-shot0-1472519803.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/37205-shot1-1472519803.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/37205-shot1-1472519803.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/37205-shot2-1472519803.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/37205-shot2-1472519803.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Itch","url":"https://godjammit.itch.io/kmf"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"LightBringer","category":"jam","description":"LightBringer is a 2D puzzle platformer where you must light up fire beacons.\n\nControls : \n\nLeft / Right arrow : Move\nSpace  : Jump\nE : Grab Torch/Light beacons\nA : Drop Torch\nleft ctrl : Invoke Torch (must have tokens)\nleft shift : Look where the torch is\n______________________________________________\nRelease edit : I've fixed a Bug where pain was undoable (and so player was unable to finish the game).","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/aebfa4d7944d14b2d4fe1a7ff9622059.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=112394","author":{"name":"Rakart","uid":112394,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9a513d0af9e3848355b31d12f6197c50?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/rakart/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112394-shot0-1472519208.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112394-shot0-1472519208.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112394-shot1-1472522376.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112394-shot1-1472522376.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112394-shot2-1472522376.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112394-shot2-1472522376.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://rakart.itch.io/lightbringer"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"PowderKeg","category":"compo","description":"Controls:\narrows/wasd: move\n9/1: spark\n0/2: pick up or put down keg\nf: fullscreen\nr: restart\nesc: quit\n\nWhat to do:\nPlace barrels near rocks to blow 'm up so you can collect the gold.

ESC returns to menu. Mouse for rest of it. \n\n\n\n-- Instructions On Patients--\n\n- For each patient find their illness by searching for symptoms in the book.\n\n- After finding the illness apply one of the known cures to patient to heal them. If the treatment is correct you'll gain reputation.\n\n- Some of the mixtures are dangerous and can kill a patient if used when unnecessery. You'll be also wasting the item If you use it on wrong patients. If you kill a patient you'll lose reputation.\n\n- If you are not sure about the sickness or don't have any of the cures you can send patients to temple for praying. This way you'll lose much less reputation compared to killing a patient.\n\n- When you fill the reputation bar your fame will grow and you'll get new items. Game will end when you hit 10 fame.\n\n\n\n-- Instructions on Alchemy --\n\n- Look at the recipe of mixture you want in the book. Add items in given order and given times.\n\n- You have to count yourself.\n\n- If you can cook successfuly, you'll get 1-3 items based on your time correctness.\n\n\nGame is done in Unity. This was a huge learning experience for me. (Espically about ScriptableObjects) And compared to my old ludum games this one is actually a standalone complete game. Well almost.

It's the first time I participate in LD, or in any game jam at all for that matter, so it was a fun and very educational experience.\n\nGoal of the game is to collect Ancient Technology artifacts and give them to the guards that are standing in the way between you and the teleport that will bring you back to present time. Search through chests and remember where the artifacts are if you need them later.\n\nHOW TO PLAY:\n* AWSD / Arrows / axies to control the character\n* Open a chest and search it by walking up to the lock\n* Find the path with guards, find the right items in the chests that they request as you approach them\n* Beat your own time to set high scores\n\nTo make this game I used Unity3D 5.3. I created the 3D objects in Blender (OMG how I had to learn and watch tutorials during the 48 hours on modelling, rigging, skinning, and animating in Blender since I have a 3DSMax background.) I used Photoshop for some textures. I composed the music (2 tracks) in Cubase with some VST-instruments. I recorded the sound effects at my computer using my voice, whistling (for the birds), crumbling paper, an banging my desk. I edited the sounds in Sound Forge and RX5.\n\nI decided to participate in LD36 on Friday, the day before. I hadn't tweaked my tools and I had some family commitments visiting a birthday party, playing with my children during the day, reading bed time stories in the night, to name a few. Thanks to my wife Nicky, and my children Aiden, Emilia, and Meja for enduring with my hours in the computer room. \n\nUpdate 20160829: Added web HTML5 port.\nUpdate 20160830: (Potential) bug fix implemented for guards not spawning on some computers and being able to leave chests too early.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/065cc3519bc39447db4b8b8559657280.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=112319","author":{"name":"imphenzia","uid":112319,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6e514068385373b56553d33190b89db9?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/imphenzia/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112319-shot0-1472430728.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112319-shot0-1472430728.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112319-shot1-1472430728.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112319-shot1-1472430728.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112319-shot2-1472430728.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112319-shot2-1472430728.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112319-shot3-1472430728.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112319-shot3-1472430728.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://games.imphenzia.com/html5/ancient-tech-to-return/"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://games.imphenzia.com/downloads/Imphenzia_AncientTechToReturn.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://games.imphenzia.com/downloads/Imphenzia_AncientTechUnity53Project.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Legacy of Kar'macx","category":"jam","description":"Apexian is a species with primitive civilization.

I am going to continue working on this so at some point the AI will be slightly intelligent. \n\nMade using:\n-Unity\n-Visual Studio\n-Photoshop\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/db183a4399347610f4bb87cdd32c9990.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=37277","author":{"name":"Wevel","uid":37277,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/aba936f47a0384d0167ebbd5e742a97c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/wevel/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/37277-shot0-1472432133.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/37277-shot0-1472432133.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/37277-shot1-1472432213.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/37277-shot1-1472432213.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/37277-shot2-1472432213.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/37277-shot2-1472432213.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://wevel.itch.io/fort-deep-search"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/o8alisu86hvjf76/FortDeepSearch_Win_1.2.zip?dl=0"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/q6h14u976adqtwi/LD36.zip?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Full Steam","category":"compo","description":"Full Steam Ahead!\n\nRide the railways in the old west.

To celebrate my 9th entry to Ludum Dare, I decided to really push myself on something a little more ambitious as far as Ludum Dare goes (Mainly I wanted to learn how to do interfaces properly). I'm pretty happy with the results!\n\nMost of the game (Scripts, Art, Shaders, etc) was done from scratch - using things I learned how to make from another project similar to this called MezraMan (http://www.gamejolt.com/games/mezraman/173443) - but I would like to thank 'invulse' for his Object Pooling script (I tried to write my own and everything went wrong) and the ProCore team for making it possible to make level editing in Unity like a million times easier. The MIDI used is of 'Slayer - Raining Blood' and is provided by Graham Downey (http://metal-midi.grahamdowney.com/midi.html)\n\nTheovexus is a Doom-Clone where you play as a Robot (Named Theovexus, mainly because it sounds cool) whose main purpose had already been fulfilled, and spends the rest of its life collecting folk lore and epic tales through time and space. (Thats what the white block outside the main chamber was going to be) After partying with the leaders of a very old civilization - however - Theovexus had taken time to build a nice and quiet place for him to hold his stuff and to rest in until he felt better.\n\nThis was all well and good until a growing, much more advanced civilization of faux-cowboys wiped out the totally chill society so they could expand their colonies. Once they stumble upon the small cavern and start hauling everything off for research, Theo wakes up PISSED and vows the destruction of the rootin-tootin folks and everything they have.\n\nI really like this idea a lot, and after the compo I'll probably be working to get a much, MUCH more polished thing done.\n\nI hope you enjoy what I scrambled to learn and finish. Have an awesome day!\n\n\n#LDJAM <----- Apparently this will summon the eldritch ones. Gotta ask them when Protomen Act III is coming out. :L","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/6b7ca8126202e5540c811d7a7c8a5a2c.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=12851","author":{"name":"Phobos001","uid":12851,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fca5bfd204cb04f07588c2448ae4a47c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/phobos001/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/12851-shot0-1472522470.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/12851-shot0-1472522470.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B45dPigIb7wZeHphZ0M0Zl9EbFk/view?usp=sharing"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B45dPigIb7wZWjdwR2tmcVJGS28/view?usp=sharing"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B45dPigIb7wZQ0o0bnZVWURyMm8/view?usp=sharing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Tic Tac Toe - Commodore 64","category":"jam","description":"Text based action so intense you'll swear you're back in 1982!!!!\n\nTwo player text based tic tac toe for the Commodore 64.

Clicking the ground will tell them to hold position on that spot. Right click to clear your banner.\n\nWASD or mouse to move the camera, spacebar to interact with upgrade totems, esc to close the upgrade menu.\n\nProbably the most complex game I've made in a Ludum Dare event, and it's still not nearly as done as I'd hoped it would be. Will probably develop this into something real in the future when I can get some help with art and better programming. Regardless, fairly happy with it.\n\nCould probably do with a balance pass. I wouldn't recommend taking on enemies until you've bought some upgrades. Although that part's intentional.\n\nTips:\n - Make sure you buy speed (the foot icon), because A) waiting is boring and B) you'll need it to catch the floaters.\n - Your movement speed caps out at 5, but it also affects your attack speed. Think of it as a soft cap.\n- Buy upgraded weapons. The top rank weapon completely changes the game in your favour.\n- The little guys will explode by themselves after a bit.

The only reason I'm submitting it, is because considering all the complications I went through and having literally no experience with most tools I used, I think it turned out ok and if I had time to fix all the bugs, it could have turned out fine. I would be grateful if you could rate it with this in mind and give me helpful criticism, if you can. I know it's way buggy to be playable, but maybe you can find some value in it.\n\nI will update this post (hopefully) with an updated, bug-fixed version of the game with controller support here, even though I understand that it may not affect my Ludum Dare scoring.\n\n---\n\nThis game is basically a two-player fighting game, where both opponents invent better technologies to be able to fight.

I don't have the computer to test this!\n\nThe Story\n\nIn a far future, the Earth has been forsaken by humanity, leaving robots to their fate. For many centuries, robots performed their task, upgraded themselves in search of perfection. And then it happened. The Glitch. A small deficiency in a neural network shut down every networked robot on the planet.\n\nThe only survivor of this holocaust is a small ancient little robot named M.A.I.N. (Mobile Artificial Intelligence Navigator); it was too old to be affected by the Glitch, and now, it is the only one which will be able to save the robots!\n\nHow to play\n\nThe target of every level is to reach the EXIT cell, but the robot is pretty stupid by itself. You need to give him instructions by placing directions (the four arrows on the bottom of the screen) on the map. To do so you can drag and drop the arrows in the level. You can also drag the level around.\n\nWhen your plan is set, you can click on top right the \"play\" button, which will tell M.A.I.N to proceed as scheduled. You won't be able to change your programmation, so plan carefully!\n\nThe four first levels are a bit like a tutorial, explaining new things and new level features. The fifth and last one start to get harder :).\n\nAround the game\n\nFor a long time I wanted to make a game that my daughter would be able to play, that doesn't requires skills and reflexes; besides this, she loves helping me while I'm doing games from the Ludum Dare, and I wanted her to take her first grasp at programmation.\n\nNext features planned\n\nMore levels. More specifics cells (with items to pickup in a stack and to release). There is a lot of improvements possible in this game....","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/1ec35a318fdbbe1dce9b3273542fe02f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=40544","author":{"name":"Mathieu Muller","uid":40544,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/877d7c73a4920e706c7cac049086285e?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/perecil/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/40544-shot0-1472508185.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/40544-shot0-1472508185.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://freebox.mathieumuller.fr/share/P9gdnpxipIlb4lFZ/LudumDare36-1.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://freebox.mathieumuller.fr/share/P9gdnpxipIlb4lFZ/LudumDare36-1.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://freebox.mathieumuller.fr/share/P9gdnpxipIlb4lFZ/LudumDare36-1.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"High Tide","category":"jam","description":"High Tide\n\nIs a first person point and click game\nthe player is stranded on a strange world.\n\nvisual storytelling\n\nthe mechanics are very simple:\nwasd to move about left mouse button to interact.\n\ni designed and developed all the game elements,\ni am a designer not a software developer so please be patient with me.\nenjoy\n\nAlon Rubin\nMy Email:\n[email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */\n\nMy portfolio:\nhttps://www.behance.net/alonzubina085\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/cbd8117b3b60b42df956d40544149a71.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=112822","author":{"name":"alobrubin","uid":112822,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b51765f6ae3e84bacf568eeb2e3031fd?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/alobrubin/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112822-shot0-1472522190.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112822-shot0-1472522190.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112822-shot1-1472500421.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112822-shot1-1472500421.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4T1e7q__zq7TFY1V0pfckxNYUU/view?usp=sharing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Homing Pigeon","category":"jam","description":"Awarded by Creative Commits : https://twitter.com/creativecommits/status/769620595306745856\n\nInspired by the true story of Polo, a homing pigeon during WW1.

Unfortunately between the late start, collaborative issues (time related) and other stuff I/we weren't able to get very far. There's smatterings of code and a few cards with placeholder artwork (mostly creative commons stuff). As such this is more of a gallery piece than a fully working game but it will hopefully give you a sense of what the game would have been like. If the community likes it/we can flesh it out more I/we think we'd like to turn it into an actual game, be it digital or paper. Anyway I hope you enjoy this jam entry.\n\nIssues:\nThe credits screen doesn't work and makes the font go funny on the title screen (the title screen still works after, it's just hard to read).\nThe card images are only low res because I didn't have time to export them with better settings. Sorry about that.\n\nHow To Play:\nClick the Events deck or the Exploration Deck in the top left to cycle through the available cards. Hover over the Used Events/Used Exploration decks to see enlarged versions of the cards. Right click to cyle backwards.\n\nA lot more work went into the game than can be seen in the submitted version. There are a lot more cards that we designed but these were the ones I had time to mock up artwork for.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/5c77b4223235ea9ddc9ac70fbe27aee6.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=28854","author":{"name":"drentsoft","uid":28854,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ea118bac85cec4af62004345149c343c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/drentsoft/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/28854-shot0-1472513839.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/28854-shot0-1472513839.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/403bp12oztyssp5/prosper-LD36.jar?dl=0"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/403bp12oztyssp5/prosper-LD36.jar?dl=0"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/403bp12oztyssp5/prosper-LD36.jar?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Pulleyrope","category":"jam","description":"You play as a well-known architect in Egypt, you’re there to solve their problems and well, mainly help them build their pyramids.\nYou do it by stretching ropes through the map, and using wisely the physic mechanic.\nTo master the game, you'll have to learn and dominate physics, you'll learn it through the games, subjects such as mechanical advantages, pulleys, and more.\n\nIn short, it is a challenging(and funny) physics puzzle game.\n\nWe'd like to know what you think about it, we worked very hard on it!\nPlease leave a comment :)\n\nSpecial thanks to Ilya Kats, who came up with the idea of the game, \nand with the designs.\n\nCredit to the background music & some sfx\nhttp://www.freesfx.co.uk","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d69dbd1024c573ccd4a0c643654a34a2.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=32169","author":{"name":"SUNFURY","uid":32169,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c86f9b3d323b45ad0fb197574cd60375?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/romandtom/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/32169-shot0-1472923841.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/32169-shot0-1472923841.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/32169-shot1-1472591910.gif-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/32169-shot1-1472591910.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/32169-shot2-1472592502.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/32169-shot2-1472592502.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/32169-shot3-1472592502.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/32169-shot3-1472592502.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/110150997/Games/LD36/PulleyRopeGame.exe"},{"label":"Our Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/teamSUNFURY"},{"label":"Our Website","url":"http://sunfury.team"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Rediscovering Earth","category":"jam","description":"IF IT GIVES YOU AN ERROR, JUST RELOAD THE PAGE.\n\n\nHelp the SPACE PROFESSOR and the ASTRONAUT identify ANCIENT HUMAN ARTIFACTS!\n(Mature tag because of some gross descriptions)\n\nArrow keys to select choice, SPACE/ENTER/X to select\n\n\nCredits:\nYanfly, Galv, Zerbu, Soulpour777 for scripts\nRyan Deshawn for music","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/fd7985606635342d50f315e2f63c2654.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=112971","author":{"name":"Bricabrac","uid":112971,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7f8065d2be56043c6c4d10301901976c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/bricabrac/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112971-shot0-1472559755.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112971-shot0-1472559755.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112971-shot1-1472559755.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112971-shot1-1472559755.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112971-shot2-1472559755.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/112971-shot2-1472559755.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://bricabrac.itch.io/rediscovering-earth"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"SETBACK","category":"jam","description":"Time is the most ancestral technology.

Use your 'add bead' key to add a bead to your side from the available \nbeads. If there are no more available beads you will instead steal one from your opponent. There are only 10 beads \nand some numbers will require more than your even share!\n\nUse your 'remove bead' key to remove a bead you previously added or that was forced onto you. Double tap that same \nkey to force a bead onto your opponent. This will throw their number off and buy you valuable time!\n\nPress the 'shake abacus' key to shake the abacus violently! This will randomize the positions of all beads on the \nabacus. Some will be on your side, some on your opponenets, and some sitting in the middle. Use this to buy yourself \ntime if you're about to lose. Only 2 shakes per game can be used, and they are shared between you and your opponent.\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/cf6ed339790ea2d76e9dc69d5de9addd.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=3308","author":{"name":"deadpixelsociety","uid":3308,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d07b801934c1bd67b3ff3044dc8b0d4a?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/deadpixelsociety/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/3308-shot0-1472419125.gif-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/3308-shot0-1472419125.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.thedeadpixelsociety.com/downloads/abacusfighter.zip"},{"label":"Mac","url":"https://www.thedeadpixelsociety.com/downloads/abacusfighter.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://www.thedeadpixelsociety.com/downloads/abacusfighter.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/deadpixelsociety/ld36"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Agent 3310","category":"jam","description":"How would you react in a high stakes « people are in danger » type situation, and where your only tool to communicate is a good ol’ Nokia 33 10 ?

You know how dangerous it is…”\n“I know. But it’s worth it”\n\nThis game is about a man named Professor Gregos. He and his coworker, Dr. Amy, have been trying to create a time machine for more than 6 years, in order to prevent WWII. And this night, Gregos has finally found the last power stone to power the machine and take them to the past.\n\nBut an accident happens, and instead of taking him to the 30’s, it takes him to the Stone Age. Determined to return to the present, he tries to seek for new power stones to power up his machine.\n\nThe game is made out of 4 levels – present, Stone Age, Ancient Egypt and The Medieval. In each level, you have to get 3 power stones, power up the machine and proceed to the next level.\n\nAs you pass from time to another, riddles and traps become harder to solve, and you can find yourself stucked in a room with no possibility to exit. The game has no “you lost” screen. You can not die in this game. The worst you can do is to never win – get stucked somewhere and not be able to go back to the present.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe took a game which was too much for us to do in 72 hours. We have cut several levels out (including Ancient Rome, the Renesans, and even the future). We didn’t succeed in putting a lot of features because of the time limit, and we don’t even have a proper UI and winning screen. Hope you forgive us for that.\n\nSpecial thanks to all our team members. Without you it would have never been possible to complete this game. Thanks to:\nYotam Salmon – for programming\nOr Navon – for texture and models design\nRon Popov – for level design\nIlya Vikulov – for sound composing\nAnd Shai Kimhi – for level design and programming\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonal note:\nI have had a great time working on this game, especially because it was my first Ludum Dare ever. I have participated in Hackathons and Global Game Jams before, but it’s my first time participating in LD. I must admit that the 72 hours is very deluding. Gives you the confidence that you have so much time, and after you spend your 60 first hours doing almost nothing, you realize how tight on time you are. Next LD I’m going to attend to the compo and make a much simpler game (maybe a platformer. Yeah, platformers are cool). Thanks to everyone who helped this LD to happen, and thanks to everyone in this community! Keep the great work up!\n\nCheers, Yotam.\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a8b56db4ad02b8b8184995fffb7c612a.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=108140","author":{"name":"yotam180","uid":108140,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e1ad137b2e52b24cdc69cec24f77d07d?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/teamfireman/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/108140-shot0-1472512030.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/108140-shot0-1472512030.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/108140-shot1-1472512030.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/108140-shot1-1472512030.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/108140-shot2-1472512030.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/108140-shot2-1472512030.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/108140-shot3-1472512050.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/108140-shot3-1472512050.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/download/mhx2015k35wh3px/Gregos_Journey.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Heat Up!","category":"jam","description":"Heat Up is about the ancient heat ray by Archimedes.

Now it gives a 2-sec Game Over screen and loads Main Menu screen.\n- Fixed the bug that made all the alien ships chase the player from the beginning of the level. Now they only activate when the player comes close. But they still annoyingly manage to pass by the wall tiles. Heck!\n===================\n\n#LDJAM\n#LD36\n\nThis is an Arcade Shoot'em Up. You are van Döniken, a mad scientist trying to find the old mystic planet Earth, where some half-witted sages say was the planet in which Humanity first evolved. And he will have a hard time getting there.\n\nI barely made it.\n\nI built something. In 30 hours, because I had to work on Saturday and had an important exam in Sunday morning. I thought I could beat the challenge, and almost made it to the end.\n\nI switched my project two times, and that made me lose even more time. I only nailed what I would really do today at 3 AM.\n\nThe core of the game is there, but I just didn't managed to build a level, nor to implement the power-ups and the variety of weapons and enemies. Not even the SoundFX effects or the animations I made. Much less to put the lore in the game. That's the saddest part, as I made something I thought was interesting.\n\nThis is the first game I ever made start-to-end. I really hope to read good feedbacks and constructive criticism. :)\n\nIf you see future on this I may even push it forward. :D\n\n:::\nCREDITS\n\nLênon Kramer: Game Design, Programming, 2D Art, Credits Screen's music.\n\nChocochurros Project: Music (except for the one on Credits Screen).\n\nTo see more of the Chocochurros Project: https://www.youtube.com/user/ChocoChur2os [their debut album is coming soon!]\n\nPlaylist:\nMain Menu: \nZumbis e Reptilianos - Chocochurros\nCredits: \nLong Road to Sigil - Lênon Kramer\nInPlay: \n(onLevelLoad) Starships and Zodiac - Chocochurros\n(randomAfter) Vertical Avenue - Chocochurros\n(randomAfter) Tiger in a Living Room - Chocochurros\n(randomAfter) Deserts and Plants - Chocochurros\n\nEDITED: updates to the description text.

This time I made a text adventure! I've been wanting to do one for some time, but never really made one. When they announced the theme Ancient Technology, I wanting to create an adventure/exploration game, with an air of mystery to the objects found, but I knew I wouldn't be able to do that graphically, I'm a programmer and my graphics skill are hardly my best. But as I also play a lot of table top RPGs, I decided to make a text game that could evoke more of the player imagination.\n\nThis game is a very simple one, and although the quality of writing doesn't keep up until the end, I hope you can have fun reading/playing this little journey. This project had many ups and downs, but I will discuss this later in my Post Mortem, which I should write after one or two weeks, after I gathered some feedback.\n\nAs always, please leave a comment so I can check your game too!\n\nCongratulations to all!\n*************************************************************************/\n\nAnnouncements:\n* (08/28) I don't know how to make the embedded browser in itch.io stretch to the whole page.

This leads to a bit of skewing, if it bothers you please use the link provided below for the original experience.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/6ff3958030597125ffa5dad319f10e4b.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=60316","author":{"name":"wrexialmt","uid":60316,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c311929d21e6a56dafb09b8e6a7a589a?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/wrexialmt/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/60316-shot0-1472508901.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/60316-shot0-1472508901.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/60316-shot1-1472508901.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/60316-shot1-1472508901.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/60316-shot2-1472508901.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/60316-shot2-1472508901.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.epichigh.xyz/LudumDare36.html"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"RIP.tech","category":"compo","description":"Once upon a time there was a civilization that managed to develop a technology that made people immortal.\nAnd then they died.\nExplore the dark Temple of Science, where death awaits those who seek immortality!\nYour objective is simple - go deeper, to uncovered the secret of the temple.\n\nControls: \nA - left\nD - right\nLeft Mouse Button - shoot\nEsc - pause\n\nTime needed to complete: Maybe 5 minutes\nTime needed to complete if you know what you're doing: around a minute.\n\nMy first entrance, please be gentle.

The system map is displayed as ASCII text, which might actually be more advanced than whatever WMATA really does. You've only got 5 repairmen available to keep the system running. Again, 5 repairmen may be generous compared to the real Metro. If every line in the system has 0% passenger capacity for 6 in-game hours, you lose.\n\nThe game is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Nothing fancy--just a quick and dirty web game.

Think Persian-version of Crazy Taxi with four drivers controlling one vehicle. Remember, you are carrying VIPs on a palanquin, so pay attention to their individual demands while marching.\n\nWHILE THIS GAME IS MEANT FOR FOUR PLAYERS, YOU CAN TOTALLY PLAY IT ALONE IF YOU HAVE A GOOD CLAW GRIP\n\nThe Controls\n\nPlayer 1\n\nMove Left     <-\nMove Right   ->\nJump   Right Shift\n\nPlayer 2\n\nMove Left    A\nMove Right    D\nJump    W\n\nPlayer 3\n\nMove Left   F\nMove Right   H\nJump   T\n\nPlayer 4\n\nMove Left   J\nMove Right   L\nJump   I\n\nThe Story\n\nAncient Purrsia is a hub for foreign trade, and people from all around the known world pass through the city on their trade routes. The King of the Kingdom--King Fat Cat--is having an epic parade in honor of the anniversary of his ascension to the throne. You are assigned to carry his most prestigious guests and His Majesty himself! No single cat can bear such responsibility alone, so the four of you must bear him together.\n\nThe city is colorful and extravagant, as are the people who pass through it. From rich merchants to shady individuals, holy men to warriors, winos to weirdos.\n\nLevel one - King Fat Cat: His Royal Highness is the latest in a long line of benevolent rulers. He doesn't quite measure up to his father in terms of brains, but he believes he is the best of his family and will be the most awesome ruler. Parade him through the city in a stately manner.\n\nLevel two - Drunk Cat (developing): He's a very rich and powerful cat, who may have over celebrated a bit at the King's parade. He's drunk and quite confused, so he never knows which way he needs to go. He also tells rambling stories as you walk. Don't move him too fast or he will vomit, don't start and stop too much or he will vomit.\n\nLevel Three - His Husky the Excellency(developing): He's a very serious and stoic kind of guy, who doesn't recognize jokes and takes everything said at face value. He has been told of a vendor selling hot dogs for food(!) and he is incredibly insulted. He demands that you take him to this vendor so that he may investigate these claims. He wants to go fast and he needs to stay cool.\n\nThe Team\n\nJustin Acker--Development, Music, Game Design, Voice Acting\nChristina Goefron--Development, Concept Art\nCorinne Cohen--Art and Animation: Lead\nVeronica Grijalva--Concept and Character Art: Lead, Narrative Design, Level Design, Editing, Vocalist\nJack Chu--Development, Level Design\nChris Bonilla--Development, Playtesting\nYuxin Gao--Music and Sound Effects, Writing\nHoteck Kan--Project Management, Sound Effects, Writing\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/46a65794cfbe7373c1c55dbc4149fff0.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=113182","author":{"name":"8Keys Studios","uid":113182,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a3a03020d88b1c29bef41ddeecc35b54?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/8keys-studios/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/113182-shot0-1472521185.gif-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/113182-shot0-1472521185.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/113182-shot1-1472523300.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/113182-shot1-1472523300.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/113182-shot2-1472521900.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/113182-shot2-1472521900.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/113182-shot3-1472522110.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/113182-shot3-1472522110.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://8keys.itch.io/paws-of-purrsia-kitty-litter"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://8keys.itch.io/paws-of-purrsia-kitty-litter"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Temple Trial","category":"jam","description":"You are an alchemist entering the famed Temple of Knowledge, in search of mythical artifacts, but you find out there aren't any.

As you begin to experiment with the materials you find in the temple, you realize you can create the artifacts you were searching for.

If you want a premature post-mortem (pre-post-mortem? pre and post cancel each other out, meaning it's a mortem?), read on.\n\nWhy scrapped? \n\nI intended to do much more with it. LD36 theme was 'Ancient technology'. My initial plan was that Oorgh is an inventor and a hunter. He'd be able to gather wood, stone and other resources to invent and create advanced tools and weapons like stone, club or even a spear!\n\nSo what happened?\n\n3 reasons.\n\n1. If you follow me on twitter (@pi_pi314), you might know that I developed this game in ANSI-C STD-99. And I didn't have nearly enough experience to develop in C like I do in Java. I also didn't have as many tools as I do when developing in Java, so I had to code some of them (and learn libpng to load images).\n\n2. Early on I chose a bad structure for the game. Due to this I had to either follow it til' the end or rewrite it. Rewriting and debugging for the 2nd time would take a hell of a lot time, so I decided not to do that.\n\n3. I had a hard time focusing. This was in fact the first time I couldn't focus properly. This has to do with some unrelated personal stuff.\n\nWhat now?\n\n​Nevertheless this Ludum Dare was an amazing experience. I learned what is good and what is bad in C (still kinda new to it, considering how extensive and powerful it is). I did some work on the tiny framework that was used in this project. I think this might've been my favorite Ludum Dare yet just because I learned more than ever before during a game jam. I wonder what will be in december. Maybe a 4.0+? That is the goal anyway.\n\nWhat am I proud of?\n\nActually, the graphics. I like how they turned out. I'm also proud of some of the internal work I did.\n\nGameplay, or how does this game work?\n\nWhile this game is unfinished, it still has some \"gameplay\".\n\nThere are exactly three mechanics:\n\n1. Walking left or right.\n\n2. Pressing w at the bush. This triggers the hunt sequence.\n\n3. The actual hunt. It's pretty self explanatory. Press space at the right time AND when the animal isn't looking up. If you hit green, you succeed instantaneously. If you hit red, you fail instantaneously. Yellow and orange have a chance of 30% and 60% of succeeding. Whether you fail or not after hitting yellow or orange is determined semi-randomly.\n\nAfter that the game ends and you get either the good or the bad ending, depending on the hunt outcome.\n\n​Source\n\nFull source code for the game is included with the game in the archive below.\n\nOnly a linux build is available. You may try to compile for Windows, but I really doubt it's possible.\n\nSo, now I'll play your submissions and do the feedbacks on the feedbackfriends. After that, see you in december!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/0635388eca554ae84e1b7bcf96288d25.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=38955","author":{"name":"pi_pi3","uid":38955,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e060423965c93355a79e8d18b0161626?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/pi_pi3/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/38955-shot0-1472426803.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/38955-shot0-1472426803.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/38955-shot1-1472426803.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/38955-shot1-1472426803.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/38955-shot2-1472426803.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/38955-shot2-1472426803.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/38955-shot3-1472426803.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/38955-shot3-1472426803.png"}],"links":[{"label":"itch.io","url":"https://pi-pi3.itch.io/age-of-oorgh"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://pi-pi3.itch.io/age-of-oorgh"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://pi-pi3.itch.io/age-of-oorgh"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Archimedes Rays","category":"jam","description":"Archimedes Heat Rays!

Anyways, there are still some critical bugs that will be fixed within the next few hours (game breaking), and I will mark them so you know they were made after the deadline (even though there is no ratings)\n\nAnyways, this game is (was supposed to be) a mashup of super smash bros. and platformers. Basically, you have to move around with A, D and W to jump. The goal is to collect pyramid pieces from killing enemies. To kill an enemy with the first guy (peasant), you hit space to melee, the next guy can throw a pot by clicking. The third guy can do both. The last guy has laser eyes. You have five lives and health per life.\n\nOnce you get enough pieces and the pyramid becomes full in the top corner, you may jump into the portal to advance into the next stage to the next person (sometimes the same).\n\nJumping on enemies bounces you up but does not affect the enemy and running into an alien will make you lose health and, eventually, your lives.\n\nHope you enjoy what the \"game\" and I hope you can leave some feedback about some non bug things. Thanks!\n\nPost-Jam Edits:\n - made music actually play\n - Enemies spawn past level 3\n - win screen added (small thing so you know you won)\n - removed wall glitch (few)\n - made arrows not invisible when shooting (soldier third guy)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/87ddf80b84238012cb82e4d97d762ea2.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=39470","author":{"name":"ajayajayaj","uid":39470,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6fcb6da170e42a410bc5e2c082559dac?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/ajayajayaj/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/39470-shot0-1472520808.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/39470-shot0-1472520808.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/55402796/Aliens%20Didnt%20Build%20Em%20LD36.jar"},{"label":"OS/X / macOS","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/55402796/Aliens%20Didnt%20Build%20Em%20LD36.jar"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/55402796/Aliens%20Didnt%20Build%20Em%20LD36.jar"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SsuTFxqps0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Ancient builder","category":"jam","description":"Ancient builder goal is simple: Try to replicate the structure other ancient people did.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/7049889c92909b18ed40d507cb4adbe6.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=46423","author":{"name":"Morax","uid":46423,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/347130e8261c636cd3b717171a531d5e?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/morax/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/46423-shot0-1472411109.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/46423-shot0-1472411109.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/46423-shot1-1472411109.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/46423-shot1-1472411109.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/46423-shot2-1472411109.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/46423-shot2-1472411109.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://moraxm.itch.io/ancient-builder"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2Q0il0K3XxFMUpfZnBQeF9tR00/view?usp=sharing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Ancient Cure","category":"compo","description":"Help a time traveler to find a hangover cure.\nI think I slowly started going away from the theme, but I am glad about the result.\nMy first Ludum Dare Jam.\n\nI used Unity, Aseprite, Tiled, BeepBox, and Bfxr.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/4af3c366d40c866dae7153b93ad4fab7.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=104181","author":{"name":"qporest","uid":104181,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c6894596632479a6a4540a2b3a4132df?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/qporest/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/104181-shot0-1472431627.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/104181-shot0-1472431627.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/104181-shot1-1472431627.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/104181-shot1-1472431627.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://qporest.itch.io/ancient-cure"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/vaaza1y8qe9mpgp/Scripts.zip?dl=1"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Archy's Revenge","category":"compo","description":"A difficult game about burning roman ships with mirrors.

You must kill Thoth's minions to draw additional cards to your hands. If your hand's value goes over 21 then that hand has BUST and will be disabled. This will automatically move your current hand to the next hand of cards. \n\nYou can press E to HOLD a hand which will prevent cards from being added to that hand and will switch to the next hand of cards. Once all 3 hands have either been BUST or HELD then the hands that you HELD will be compared to Thoth's. All hands that are higher in value than Thoth's cause additional benefits for the player. \n\nThoth is invulnerable until the hands have been revealed.\n\nIf you have 0 winning hands then Thoth will rain down beams of light at random locations which you would need to avoid. \nIf you have 1 winning hand then Thoth will shoot a laser from his crown in a horizontal motion, you also deal 5 times damage to it. \nIf you have 2 winning hands then Thoth will do a series of slam attacks in front of it, you also deal 10 times damage to it.\nIf you have 3 winning hands then Thoth will be stunned for a short duration allowing you free reign to attack it, you also deal 20 times damage to it.​\n\nEDIT: Re-updated so that the UI scales with screen!\n\nBrought to you by Ouroboros Games Studio.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ed83a9f0bd1e521d77bb7571957ff338.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=110026","author":{"name":"Alkrimil","uid":110026,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/41b63f6f7ac21a85b94971e06d373de9?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/alkrimil/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110026-shot0-1472508578.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110026-shot0-1472508578.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110026-shot1-1472508578.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110026-shot1-1472508578.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110026-shot2-1472508578.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110026-shot2-1472508578.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110026-shot3-1472508578.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/110026-shot3-1472508578.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://ouroborosgames.itch.io/faro"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Faxapult!","category":"jam","description":"Combining two forms of ancient technology, the venerable catapult and the illustrious fax machine, Faxapult! brings you the finest in procedurally-generated fax-hurling fun.\n\nProgramming, Art: Keegan van der Laag (http://github.com/kvanderlaag)\nMusic, Sound: Colton Phillips (http://github.com/ColtonPhillips)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/88e978a575977a8c7f888b03cd285afd.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=55210","author":{"name":"kvanderlaag","uid":55210,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/aabf02e874be0eb7fcd936b748979364?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/kvanderlaag/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/55210-shot0-1472522572.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/55210-shot0-1472522572.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/55210-shot1-1472522572.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/55210-shot1-1472522572.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/ColtonPhillips/ludumdare36/blob/master/Faxapult.exe?raw=true"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Flagellarium","category":"jam","description":"A spaceship from the planet Catecus has landed on top of the sacred totem.

Thus I present to you, ladies and gentlemen, a beautiful ragdoll-and-blood-filled game featuring a genetic algorithm, a reference to 'The Killers' and my amazing piano arranging skills (as always, made in much less than 48 hours).\n\nThe \"game\" is a simulation of the development of (killing) technology - from ancient stuff (chucking bricks and rocks) to excitingly complex things like guns that fire guns.\n\nWhat you have to do is simply to answer the questions at the start (these act as parameters for the simulation) and enjoy the ensuing carnage. The machines get pretty good at taking out entire crowds of ragdolls at about generation 5 so be patient.\n\nAlso, if any of you guys feel like building the game in Unity Pro and making it into a screensaver, hmu because that would be fab.\n\n______________________________\nTHE ALGORITHM: I've used a genetic algorithm which basically means that the first generation is randomly generated. Then the most murderous of the first generation are bred together to produce a second even more murderous generation. It's basically natural selection on a computer!\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/cf779d4ff45c91a18f49d4cbd0415d53.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=46596","author":{"name":"peterthehe","uid":46596,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6359621d625ba9b41de28659c992d150?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/peterthehe/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/46596-shot0-1472428144.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/46596-shot0-1472428144.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/46596-shot1-1472428661.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/46596-shot1-1472428661.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/46596-shot2-1472428661.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/46596-shot2-1472428661.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/46596-shot3-1472428661.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/46596-shot3-1472428661.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (Fastest, Firefox)","url":"https://peterthehe.itch.io/it-started-out-with-a-brick"},{"label":"Web (Slower, Chrome)","url":"https://peterthehe.itch.io/it-started-out-with-a-brick-for-chrome"},{"label":"PC/Mac/Linux (Slower)","url":"https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B3rZeKUDjp8idWcySlpHMkp6QW8&usp=sharing"},{"label":"Source (Contains Broken Dreams)","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3rZeKUDjp8iV3RxOFNaVXpPVWM"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKk3MG4ZF74"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","mac","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Just Another RTS","category":"compo","description":"Another RTS.\nMa first Ludum Dare.\nI know it's shit.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/9b52716a87b2bb18517fe976debfd54c.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=111574","author":{"name":"morgan2548510","uid":111574,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8081eb099b623d7901225489db782dcb?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/morgan2548510/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111574-shot0-1472423363.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111574-shot0-1472423363.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/6o2xgehuhrtinvi/Just%20Another%20RTS.exe?dl=1"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/imhkpyibvu5l5di/Just%20Another%20RTS.gmz?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Keep It Up!","category":"jam","description":"Made on an actual boat, in 2 hours!\nhttps://twitter.com/hashtag/shiplog?src=hash\n\nThe wind is strong and someone left the gunports open!\n\nInspired by real life events of 1628","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/1aa6aeed58793933f371443c684d4d2e.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=42012","author":{"name":"nothke","uid":42012,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cbab4b2d05347c48a4567c41b8795879?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/nothke/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/42012-shot0-1472522142.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/42012-shot0-1472522142.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6-Kp1pObiWgcG1sbFpRVlQxZjQ/view?usp=sharing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Map The Stars","category":"compo","description":"You are an ancient astronomer working with a partner to try and create a book of star charts and maps but nothing can really be that simple.

The tomb will have an eye tile next to it. For this stage, you must draw a path from the entrance to the eye. Once the path is drawn, press the \"Done\" button in the bottom right corner. \n\nNext, you will be put into the trap laying phase. During this phase, you will need to use your remaining money to place traps. You can get a detailed description of each trap by hovering over it. To select a trap, simply left click it. If it is a wall mounted trap, you must select the direction it faces using the radio buttons next to the trap.  \n\nAfter you are done laying traps, you are ready to start. Press the start button and watch the thieves traverse the hallways. Once all the thieves are cleared, you will be given a score.\n\nThank you for playing.

Mobile browsers might not work right, the game is intended to be played using a mouse.\n\n-------------\n\nChanges since initial release:\n* Increased text speed\n* Improved event randomisation by making sure the last 3 events don't happen again\n\n-------------\n\nAbout:\nThis is my 5th entry for Ludum Dare. I tried to incorporate the theme both in the content of the game, as in the way it's presented. The game was intended for the compo, but I ran out of time, so I submitted for the Jam a day later instead. It does comply with the other rules of the compo.\n\nI have mixed feelings about this entry. I'm happy with the story, the style, how the game works and I like a lot of the content. I am however not entirely happy with the amount of content. Writing them took me longer than I thought it would.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/968944aa7065481a6697180703a6e6a5.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=49432","author":{"name":"Tijn","uid":49432,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f58a996c2917cdd0d7f53f4d3a184a8c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/tijn/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/49432-shot0-1472516740.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/49432-shot0-1472516740.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/49432-shot1-1472516740.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/49432-shot1-1472516740.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/49432-shot2-1472516740.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/49432-shot2-1472516740.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/49432-shot3-1472516740.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/49432-shot3-1472516740.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://dev.martijnfrazer.nl/ld36/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Switchboard Operator","category":"jam","description":"Ever wanted to be a switchboard operator but you weren't alive when you could be one.

It may take two-three plays to fully understand all the mechanics, use the \"help interface\"! (pressing H while in-game)\n\n---\n\nInstructions.: \n\nBest played on fullscreen. Highly recommended to download the desktop versions(web version might take a while to load sounds and music) and press \"H\" while playing your first game (that will trigger the help interface).\n\nMove around with the arrow keys, plant seeds with \"X\" and switch your selected plant with \"Z\". \n\nThe planet is dying slowly and everytime you plant a new seed it regenerates. Plants bloom and die on a given season, collect fruits once they have bloomed to get more seeds.\n\nPay attention to the interface, as it'll let you know when each plant will bloom or die.\n\n---\n\nCredits.:\n\n@celer_gut - music and sound design\n@Ludipe - design and code\n@ruben_oluwa - art and animation","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/3260afde939919621685a971f7611491.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=20471","author":{"name":"Ludipe","uid":20471,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/109a3118c055b995e594e5a4a0255d27?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/ludipe/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/20471-shot0-1472506304.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/20471-shot0-1472506304.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/20471-shot1-1472506304.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/20471-shot1-1472506304.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/20471-shot2-1472506304.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/20471-shot2-1472506304.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/20471-shot3-1472506304.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/20471-shot3-1472506304.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Post-Mortem","url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/2016/09/01/emily-morrisons-garden-post-mortem/"},{"label":"Web (GameJolt)","url":"http://gamejolt.com/games/emily-morrison-s-garden/184182"},{"label":"Itch.io","url":"https://ludipe.itch.io/emily-morrisons-garden"},{"label":"Windows (32)","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/492193142/EmilyMorrison_win32.zip"},{"label":"OS/X (64)","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/492193142/EmilyMorrison_osx64.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Fire Quest","category":"jam","description":"You're a caveman on the quest to create fire.\n\n--How to play--\nType commands to make the caveman do stuff.\n\nThere are 2 ways to win.

If you pull your net through a school it will become visible.\nEach \"day\" is 5 minutes long.\nYou may empty your ship early by pushing \"Empty\". This will allow you to cash in immediately but lose the ship.\nShips will leave automatically once they get full and once the \"day\" is over.\n\nSTATS:\nBoat lvl 1: 100lbs, 2m (sardine and trout)\nBoat lvl 2: 250lbs, 3m (lvl1 + salmon)\nBoat lvl 3: 500lbs, 5m (lvl2 + tuna)\nNet lvl 1: 10lbs, tuna only guaranteed catch\nNet lvl 2: 50lbs, tuna, salmon, and trout guaranteed\nNet lvl 3: 100lbs, everything guaranteed\nSardine: 1lb, $5\nTrout: 5lbs, $20\nSalmon: 10bs, $70\nTuna: 20lbs, $100\n\nThings to note:\nI was sadly unable to add any sounds/music due to time. I was hoping to at least have wave sounds :'(\nSometimes when fishing a sardine school you will not get any more from it. This is a bug in the algorithm for \"chance caught\". It's saying that the boat should catch < 1 fish so it rounds down to 0. Just move your boat somewhere else or empty it.\nThis game is probably incredibly unbalanced. Have fun! :P\n\nKNOWN BUGS/ISSUES:\n- When going back to the main menu after the day is done the levels aren't correct. They are still correct in the backend just not displayed correctly. If you were to upgrade again it would jump to the correct number.\n- You are allowed to buy upgrades that make you not able to afford the boats.\n\nIDEAS:\n- End day button","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/4e3bf63bd46152942d6d9282ae914e8b.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=35043","author":{"name":"adamk33n3r","uid":35043,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4c57872b82006176ffcaf211f19421b3?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/adamk33n3r/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/35043-shot0-1472435533.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/35043-shot0-1472435533.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"itch.io","url":"https://adamk33n3r.itch.io/fishing-is-fun"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/adamk33n3r/LD36/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Five Ancient Keys","category":"compo","description":"Books tell of a small, ancient civilization that lived underground and kept all of their treasure behind a door labelled with a star.\nYou read those books.\nYou want that treasure.\n\nA, D to move.\nSpace to interact.\nEnter to cancel.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis  is a short puzzle/adventure game that doesn't take itself too seriously.\n\nThis is my first Ludum Dare submission and I am eager to read your comments. \nThank you!\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/de78f4bbf5128abf0a96c7b156e4b236.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=57713","author":{"name":"Cody Hansen","uid":57713,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d949232f4a47be1a75722836f00747f8?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/toeboe/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/57713-shot0-1472411595.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/57713-shot0-1472411595.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/57713-shot1-1472411595.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/57713-shot1-1472411595.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/57713-shot2-1472411595.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/57713-shot2-1472411595.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://codyhansen.itch.io/five-ancient-keys"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://codyhansen.itch.io/five-ancient-keys"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://codyhansen.itch.io/five-ancient-keys"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Garden Of Sleeping Rocks","category":"compo","description":"It's a clicker game without out clicking.\n\nMouse position is an ancient input technology and mostly underrated by its own.

The way to stabilize these glitches is to walk through them. Then you are immediately teleported near the next glitch to stabilize. The glitches move forward through time and are guarded. God himself is unable to do this himself because he was weakened by the Universe Alpaca. They fought for centuries and eventually God won but he was very weakened. \nGod gives you the ability to travel through time. He uses that ability to get through puzzles (e.g. plants a seed and passes time and climbs it, goes to winter to make ice bridge, goes to summer to make water level rise) but he has a time limit, and he can only move time forward, not backward. At some point he comes to 2016 and his past self (our present self) joins in the quest and helps. \nWhile playing as the present self, we solve puzzles through platforming. Eventually the two take out all glitches and are teleported to the god’s realm. In there, they learn the truth. \nWhat is the truth you ask? well.. you’ll just have to play the game to find out!\n\nCredits: \nCoding team: William Song Liu, Vikaas\nGraphics team: Max, Ghost\nScript: Run\n\nDownload and run instruction:\nClick the download link that is for your platform.\nIt will probably be a Google Drive folder link.\nDownload all content from the folder, not just the exe file or app file for it to work.\n\nPlease wait for future updates for better gameplay!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/da4a6338c4f0ebb5dac9cf1597e4518d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=92676","author":{"name":"bobthezealot","uid":92676,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bc26ea534b6355ba356c4a08dcaab377?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/bobthezealot/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/92676-shot0-1472522330.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/92676-shot0-1472522330.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/92676-shot1-1472522330.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/92676-shot1-1472522330.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8oTFZNbbqwTSXdSTFJpcXo5Tzg"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8oTFZNbbqwTVzZOUDBOMFBmY2s"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Last Sea","category":"compo","description":"You are a Hunter sent to Last Sea, a place where strange objects have fallen from the sky during the night.\n\nAfter getting yourself in a boat, you'll travel across the waters of a dangerous place.\n\n---\n\nUsed C++ / SFML.\nI joined the competition a bit late, but i tried my best to make something playable on time, feels incomplete, but learned a few things from this.\n\nStill not sure about fitting the theme.\n---\n\nDidn't have the chance to test it on another PC.

You work for a leader of your nation, the Dr.Back. To defend the county, the Dr.Back's plan consists in building strong robots. In order to do so, he will need a very ancient and lost technology, the Alnium.\n\nThe key of Allan's laboratory was found in the AIPS historic libray. Your mission is to go deep in the lab and to found the main computer to extract datas and bring them back to the doctor.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nHow to play:\n\nUse ZQSD or WASD to move on four direction.\nUse the arrow key to shot an energy blast.\nUse space to dash.\nUse CTRL to be stealth (Currently useless... It was programed for \"The Infiltrator\")\nUse SHIFT to be surrounded by lighting (Currently useless... But a little cool)\nUse ESC to exit.\n\nWhen the character is talking, use space or return as a next button.\n\nOn the splash screen, escape or return allow you to skip it. Space increase its speed.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAbout the game itself:\n\n\"Allan\" is an adventure and action game with a top-down-almost-3D view. It is almost visible, but the story takes place in the universe of \"The Derision\", a role playing game book.\nThere is doors, there is keys, there is monsters and traps. In some ways, it is a Zelda-like game.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAbout the program:\n\n192*128 (For the game itself. The window is 1440*900)\nMade with LibLapin (A C layer on top of SFML which also brings parsings functionalities... also made by me)\nFully developped in C++.\nRaytraced shadows.\nTop-down parralax.\n\nThe 3D engine was made for the previous Ludum Dare (And the \"LowRes Jam\") for the game \"The Infiltrator\" that I did not manage to finish... (The resolution was even lower... 64*64)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAbout the jam:\n\nI almost programmed nothing during this month. This game jam was an opportunity to work hard again. I was really slow, even with an already almost terminated engine...\nI regret a little the complete absence of music and sounds effect. I think I will add it soon in a post jam version... It feels empty without sounds, even if I tried to work the graphics more than usual. The music is already written and the sound effects are ready... they are just not in the game!!!\n\nThere is only a few levels. I think adding levels may be cool too. Adding monsters, I think, is also a must.\n\n\"Ancient Technology\" for the story (well... a little) and for the graphics.\n\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nAbout the end of the jam:\nWell. It is 4AM here. Good night.\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nUpdate:\nAugust, 30, 7PM.\n- Windows version.\n- Music and sound effects added. (So, for the not post-jam version, just set the volume to 0 xD )\n- Canon corpse fixed.\n\nSeptember, 4, 1AM\n- Stairs glitch fixed. The character does not appeir to go a little under the roof.\n- Light & Height glitch fixed. The roof is not more enlighted now that anything else, even when you are high.\n- Corners blink less\n- The point of view is now precisely ON the character and not under.\n- When you blink after you hurt your finger or you organs, you cannot fall into holes anymore.\n- 4 hearts instead of 3.\n- A light bar added.\n- A smaller font is now used for the textbox.\n- ALLANUMINIUM!\n- Voice and translation in the Derision language. (Absolutely useless, but I like it this way!)\n- Dead end on the second floor removed thanks to two additional blue buttons.\n- There is now a menu and a title screen.\n- Death animation.\n- You can now die three times before having to start from scratch.\n- There is now a tutorial.\n- There is some additional text to help you a little more.\n- Two hearts when a box give you a heart and that you are almost dead.\n- Lighting on the canon when destroyed. Yeah, that's why it still hurt when you touch it.\n- The thunder spell now works, it destroys enemies around (including shots)\n- Being stealth made the turrets to not see you.\n\nThis is still the SAME game. There is no additional monsters, items, levels or anything.\nBut I am interested in going on. Maybe I will try to greenlight it on Steam and make a bigger game. Some of my friends are motivated by making a Zelda like game in the universe of our role playing game book... and I am at least equally motivated.\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/cfa93c61153d52377a97963f856c4386.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=45212","author":{"name":"Damdoshi","uid":45212,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cf69e52be157261668a64e2ed0b1a8dd?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/damdoshi/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/45212-shot0-1472520836.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/45212-shot0-1472520836.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/45212-shot1-1472520836.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/45212-shot1-1472520836.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/45212-shot2-1472519437.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/45212-shot2-1472519437.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/45212-shot3-1472519437.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/45212-shot3-1472519437.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows (Jam)","url":"http://hangedbunnystudio.com/content/allan_windows.zip"},{"label":"Windows (Post Jam)","url":"http://hangedbunnystudio.com/content/allan_windows1.1.zip"},{"label":"Linux (Post Jam)","url":"http://hangedbunnystudio.com/content/allan_linux1.1.tar.gz"},{"label":"IndieExpo","url":"http://www.indiexpo.net/fr/games/allan"},{"label":"Hanged Bunny Studio","url":"http://hangedbunnystudio.com"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Antiquellection","category":"jam","description":"-  You are running an antique store.

They can only be opened by collecting ancient relics.  (Stone wheels, vaccuum tubes, and arrow heads were all I managed to add in time.)  The world itself is not dangerous, despite my intentions to add more obstacles, but there's a catch. Your time in each sector is limited because you've kind of been turned into a floppy diskette and are operating on borrowed power.\n\n[Update: Yeah, it'd probably help if I linked to a Windows Build that actually contained the game assets.

We decided to go with the main theme of an archery defense game, but used the calendar idea as a twist to allow for special powers at different moments, like crop seasons or lunar phases. \n\nMany thanks to Sparklin Labs for their gorgeous asset pack (https://github.com/sparklinlabs/superpowers-asset-packs), which we ostensibly used.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e9ce733a27b0e10589734191f5b4c514.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=113229","author":{"name":"kraiom","uid":113229,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b07ba3acbb283d8c5ed12379bc7dae88?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/kraiom/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/113229-shot0-1472519053.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/113229-shot0-1472519053.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/113229-shot1-1472519053.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/113229-shot1-1472519053.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/113229-shot2-1472519053.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/113229-shot2-1472519053.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (HTML5)","url":"https://kraiom.itch.io/ninurta"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/sohakes/ld36"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"No Man's Clay","category":"jam","description":"Try to invent the cube from wheel, using ancient alien technology.\n\nControls:\n\n​Right and Left arrows to move, up or down to interact with objects.\n\nTip: interact with the square slot to restart with the \"wheel\" object.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a84288ef1bfa7bc568a2d0961be6eb75.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=62241","author":{"name":"Rfdshir","uid":62241,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/698df5d2210f944ec58baf2d4dcbee0c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/rfdshir/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/62241-shot0-1472509663.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/62241-shot0-1472509663.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/62241-shot1-1472509663.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/62241-shot1-1472509663.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/62241-shot2-1472509823.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/62241-shot2-1472509823.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/62241-shot3-1472509663.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/62241-shot3-1472509663.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/itchio/html/266760/index.html"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://michaelrfdshir.itch.io/no-mans-clay"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Secret Balance","category":"compo","description":"You wake up suddenly without knowing whats going on... you must figure out what to do\n\ncan you save us all?\n\n\nControls:\n\nW,A,S,D -

What they found might change what we know of the history of life forever. The planet's small habitable band is covered with ruins of an ancient species that must have died out long before humans ever set foot there.

This new technology helped the fight with other creatures greatly.\n\nBut one day, the earth is invaded by unknown creatures. All of your kind has mutated and you are the only one survived! And they along with a lot of zerglings and titans destroyed your homeland!\n\nNow it's your time! Show me what you can do with this ultimate weapon as an ancient ranger!\n\n============\n\nControls:\nWASD : Move\nLeft mouse button : Charge and fire\nRight mouse button : Emit the Force (It requires cooling down after using it once, and you will hear notification sound effect when it's ready)\nLeft Shift : Sprint\nQ : Switch weapon\n\n============\n\nInstructions in battle\n\nThere're two kinds of weapons.\n\nStones are reliable for dealing a lot of DMG, but requires charging for a while. Besides, stones have strong knock-back on light enemies.\nArrows now have higher fire rate and DPM but lower DMG. You will have to choose proper weapon to deal with different situations.\n\nThere're three types of enemies.\n\nOrcs are normal one. You will have to kill it by at least two stone shot or multiple arrows.\nZerglings now have higher speed and hp. You won't be able to kill it with only one arrow, but one half-charged stone is enough to take it down. Think carefully about weapons.\nTitans now will not be useless! Approaching titans will slow down your speed and if you didn't managed to escape you will be surrounded by zerglings suddenly!\nGood luck!\n\nBTW: Please run at full screen mode. There may be some bug in window mode due to some reason from Unity.\n\n============\n\nSome Questions:\n\nQ: Why there is no dot in the center of screen to help aiming?\n\nA: Because you are ancient ranger! Do you think you'are able to fire the stones precisely? No. Try to guess the trace of your weapons and make them of good use. Good luck!\n\nQ: It's hard to aim and shoot when lots of enemies are moving towards you?\n\nA: Yes. If there's an enemy blocking your slingshot, the dmg of your weapon will be really low. So keep distance from them. In fact, once you are surrounded while your Force isn't ready, you will die in seconds.\n\nQ: Why does the movement speed is so low?\n\nA: Because trying not to get surrounded is part of the game. It will be too easy if you can move at high speed. Use sprint and force to avoid being surrounded.\n\n============\nAbout movement speed:\n\nThanks to everyone who made suggestion! \nI tried to improve movement speed, but the game is just getting too boring. Currently zerglings could catch you when you are not sprinting away from them, and orcs could catch you when you trying to simply hit & run. If player has higher speed, orcs may be harmless even with increased amount. To avoid this, both player and enemies' speed must be improved. In that case, zerglings would move too fast. \nSo in my opinion it's hard to improve movement speed while keeping it interesting. It would be different if I added more mechanics, enemies and skills in it. \nI've uploaded a alternative version with higher speed.\nOrginal Version:\nForward Speed : 6   Strafe and Backward Speed : 3  Sprinting Multiplier : 1.5 Hp : 100\nHigher Speed Version:\nForward Speed : 7   Strafe and Backward Speed : 5  Sprinting Multiplier : 1.8 Hp : 200\n============\nSorry about my poor English......","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/f2ca48e4ff3ee850d07b0b44f57ae44b.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=89746","author":{"name":"Kitkom","uid":89746,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bfe0ee687faca99ec1424bd44002706e?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/kitkom/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/89746-shot0-1472464262.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/89746-shot0-1472464262.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/89746-shot1-1472464262.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/89746-shot1-1472464262.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/89746-shot2-1472464262.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/89746-shot2-1472464262.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/89746-shot3-1472464262.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/89746-shot3-1472464262.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://kitkom.itch.io/ancient-ranger-with-ultimate-technology"},{"label":"Windows (higher movement speed version)","url":"https://kitkom.itch.io/ancient-ranger-with-ultimate-technology"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Bro-Mag Arena","category":"jam","description":"Which of your bros is the most pro?

What most people don't know is that the pyramids are actually spaceships that were used to conquer the earth! Let's rewind 5000 years into the past and re-experience the moment of us overcoming their attack in the thrilling, photo realistic sci-fi shooter!\n\n================================\n\nGoals:\n\nYou are the mage defending against the pyramid. Don't die.\nIf all the people die, you lose.\nKill the pyramid to win.\n\n================================\n\nControls:\n\nWASD - Move\nLeft mouse button - Press to place a magical rocket - hold down to charge - release to fire. If the rocket doesn't hit the pyramid it will fall back to earth and explode, so watch out!\nRight mouse button - Hold down the right mouse button and make a circle with the mouse to create a shield. The shield will be created when you let go of the mouse button. The bigger the shield, the shorter it will last.\n\n================================\n\nComments (feel free to skip this part):\n\nPersonally I think this has much lower quality than my other LD entries. I was planning to only work on it for 6 hours, so my ambition level was very low. I did it all on my laptop while stationed in the sofa. It turned into double the time I had planned, and at least it turned out good enough to kill a bit of time for me. What I think personally it's missing the most (as in, it could obviously be improved in pretty much every single other aspect as well :) ) is stuff like intros, outros, health meters and other indicatiors. And sound of course. The idea was for the pyramid to crash and take the position it's in today when you kill it. Anyway, pay attention to the pyramid just wreaking havoc on the world if you do nothing. That's probably what turned out the best. If you scare the people that start outside the houses they will also act a bit more naturally, they're less static after that.\n\n================================\n\nOriginal description:\n\nThe truth about the Pyramids.

smartphones.\n\n/////controls////////\n\nmovement = w,a,s,d or arrow keys\n\nplace farm and traps etc with mouse left click(long click and not on top of other stuff).\nalso left click to use sword.\n\nbuild:(1,2,3,4 keys)\nfarm = press 1  (costs :40 credits)\nspike trap = press 2  (costs :10 credits)\nwood fence = press 3  (costs :20 credits)\ncrossbow tower = press 4  (costs :50 credits)\n\nif anything is not clear write in the comments.\n\n/////how to play////////\n\nat first build only farms to build your economy(build farms only).\nyou can do that until wave 10 or 8.\nthen you build a crossbow tower on each side.\nadd some fences and spike trap,survive a few waves.\nwhen you reach 900 credits you win.\n\nthe monsters are weak at the first 10 waves,after that you will need traps and turrets.\nthey have an attack timer so if you hit them fast you wont get hurt.\n\nthe monsters will attack farms at random, you will have a small amount of time to save the farm when they reach it.\n\n\n//////devlopment experience////////\n\nthis is my second ludum dare.\n\ni wanted to make a top down shooter. but becuse of the theme i made a top down slasher.\nthe genre i choose was arcade defence. its easy to implement and ive done this before (i have a tower defence framework prototype and other defence type games under my belt).\nafter the first day and all the bugs and proformnce issus my dom based js engine have.\ni realised i wont be  able to implement everything i wanted it wasnt realistic.\ni droped sound effects and ui...\n\nnext time i wont be using it im moving on to phaser,it has everything i need and more, plus i can port my framework on top of it so my workflow wont change.\n\nthe code of this game is a mess becuse of time pressure usually i try to be more efficent and create reusable methods and classes.\ni manged to create two behaviors before it went to hell, i had to sacrifice alot to be able to make time for everything.\nwriting this,uploading the game to github. creating a small 8bit track and a logo (almost two hours).\nalso i had to use a gif recorder to record gameplay.\n\ni created the --game art-- on the first day, im a programmer not an artist.\n\nin the last ludum dare it was easier i only had to implement 2-4 mechanics to create. an original game is harder to create.\nand most of the time 2-4 mechanics is not enough.\n\nbut as i get used to it i will be able to take larger scope two day projects.\n\n\nludum dare have thought me alot about myself,my tools ,self discipline,staying calm under pressure,setting goals,and \"finishing\" another game.\nthis compo/jam is great for the aspiring game developer, which is a dream of alot of us.\ni hope one day i will get into the indie industry and make a living from what i love to do.\n\n------critique-------\nif you have any critique shot. i know of alot of bugs. but i wouldn't mind hearing from other people.\n\n-------previous ludum

If you get them all in the right slot, you'll get the maximum 20 points for that prototype.\n\nThere are a few points I didn't manage to get into the in-game instructions:\n\n* Right-click or click the polygon icon on the left again to finish a polygon.\n* You can't create concave polygons yet (since box2djs doesn't work well with them). The game should stop you creating concave polygons.\n* If you click inside a polygon when you're in polygon creation mode you'll highlight a corner. You can nudge that corner using the arrow keys to finely adjust the polygon.\n* Use the pin tool to anchor stone shapes to the back wall, otherwise they'll fall off.

If there are any issues at all, please let us know. One of the main issues that caused many problems was that we could not find a stable enough Repo to take in assets and code with everything else and not break. So we had to get creative with how we combined work. While we were doing that, many items broke and building the game with everything included was very difficult. so little updates to code like a proper death and some other level work was lost.

You can hide from them by holding W, and A and D are left and right. Holding down while on stairs will enable you to fall through them. When you have picked up a gun, shoot by holding shift and clicking the left mouse button while aiming with the mouse. Walking towards a door and pressing space will open it, providing you have a key. Keys will open any door but are consumed. \nSurvive, and bring all the artifacts to the eldritch Device in the basement and see what the future has in store...will you find out what happened to the owner, or follow him to his fate?\n\nThis game has numerous flaws, for example, i should've used Spriter rather than animating with paint and Game Maker's inbuilt sprite system. There are no particle effects as i'd planned due to time running out, and sound effects are functional. I went for something weird and alien as a theme...i suggest not listening at full volume as it may be loud. I also didn't manage to get the scrolling backgrounds for the main level done...boo! hope you like purple :P\n\nI am still relatively happy, and with a couple more sessions, it could even be pretty good...keep in mind this is my very first time finishing a game from scratch, and my first LD, so i hope you enjoy it for what it is! \nConstructive criticism and suggestions are welcome, and i hope you all had fun!\n\nEdit: just added the crucial info that you have to click the left mouse button while holding shift to shoot, and aim at the enemies. Sorry about that!\n\nEdit: Also, rather than clicking the medicine pack in the inventory to recover, you can also hit H if you're carrying one. I will add a shortcut key for the ammo loading as well. To be nice, i made it so you can only pick up ammo clips and medicine packs if your inventory slot is empty, so you don't waste them by walking over them\n\nChange log:\nFixed a bug with the inventory that caused a crash","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/6f74949e45ab00814c9668daf1700579.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=107874","author":{"name":"darthbox1","uid":107874,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d3e28c4e29f721ddbee679de2d8636e8?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/darthbox1/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/107874-shot0-1472521890.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/107874-shot0-1472521890.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/107874-shot1-1472521890.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/107874-shot1-1472521890.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/107874-shot2-1472521890.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/107874-shot2-1472521890.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2GzvcE3TVc-ckt5ZEVXWkRhYWs/view?pref=2&pli=1"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"VHS","category":"compo","description":"tl;dr: wait for the tape to rewind, hit [space] to pause at the start.

The map is also somewhat randomly generated.\n\nSOURCE: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/26qhqcbliel142g/AABxuO7tEdWxZxLno5ER3fxVa?dl=0\n\nKnown Issues:\nThe hitboxes is a bit off\nThe game is overall kinda short(need longer levels and more obstacles)\nMenu is empty\nBackground music is looping weird","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/fd0ee3546d9ce4c03f554414a1acbaca.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=49612","author":{"name":"Mieeh","uid":49612,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a25c8483d0b1a65bb8ff18c0739d22a6?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/mieeh/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/49612-shot0-1472391231.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/49612-shot0-1472391231.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/49612-shot1-1472391231.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/49612-shot1-1472391231.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/49612-shot2-1472391231.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/49612-shot2-1472391231.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/49612-shot3-1472391231.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/49612-shot3-1472391231.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://mieeh.itch.io/the-great-escape"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"TI-82 DODGE","category":"compo","description":"Digging through some ancient technology, I have used a TI-82 Calculator graphics library for Borland Turbo Pascal and created a (very simple) game for 16-bit DOS.\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\n*  80286 3MHz or higher\n*  EGA or VGA Graphics Adapter\n*  30 KB Disk Space (floppy or hard drive)\n*  DOS 5.0\n*  PKUNZIP v2.04g\n\nMaximum System Requirements:\n*  An OS that can run 16-bit DOS programs.

The point of the game is, like the Antikythera mechanism (age 200bc), to perform mathematical calculations using mechanical components. This is my first LD entry, and I made it in just under 7 hours, because I arrived late to the party :)\nI didn't have time to implement any puzzles or tutorials, so it's only a sandbox of mechanics, but I put some suggestions up for some mathemathical functions you could try to recreate (only one at a time ofc). You select one gear or more as an input gear (from the type drop down and click the meter then the gear), and it will start rotating. Then add an output gear. The first task is to create one which will double the rotation (by simply putting a gear 20 cogs next to one with 10, so the ration will be 2:1), so that the output gear rotates twice as fast as the input gear. (The output meter is only there to visualize the rotation)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/794197b5b2dde6d2cb11c7b1ff61efe9.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=51685","author":{"name":"potrik98","uid":51685,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9ca9002ee857f2a046bcacbe062f141d?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/potrik98/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/51685-shot0-1472418835.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/51685-shot0-1472418835.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://hermanhenriksen.no/antikythera/"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://hermanhenriksen.no/antikythera/"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://hermanhenriksen.no/antikythera/"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://hermanhenriksen.no/antikythera/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://hermanhenriksen.no/antikythera/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"CardCamp","category":"compo","description":"​Game made in 48h for the Ludum Dare #36 - Ancient Technology.\nIt's a single player card game, I was inspire by apps like Tinder and the game Reigns. I don't know if I will continued this project but I think he has a lot of potential.\n\nThe goal is to arrive in the Middle Age without having a stat at 0%. Your stats are \"Money\", \"Social\" and \"Army\". Each stat has its color code, army -> red, social -> blue and money -> green. The last stat is the  \"Techno\", when this stat is at 100%, you need to finish the round and after you can choose a new technology. Each technology get a bonus to its speciality. For example, if you choose \"writing\", you have a bonus of 1% for each choice corresponding of the technology.\n\nThe game is written in Java, I use Inkscape for the graphisms (except the font, I use Gimp). The music was made with Bosca Ceoil and the game engine was written from Scratch.\nSo enjoy and Good Luck ;).","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ef5e7780192e9599c2468eb03b99fe3d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=15933","author":{"name":"S0rax","uid":15933,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3b0520a4b14f43cac526d7c59f9d6626?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/s0rax/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/15933-shot0-1472420274.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/15933-shot0-1472420274.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/15933-shot1-1472420274.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/15933-shot1-1472420274.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/15933-shot2-1472420274.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/15933-shot2-1472420274.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/15933-shot3-1472420274.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/15933-shot3-1472420274.png"}],"links":[{"label":"All","url":"https://sorax.itch.io/cardcamp"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/YannDub/CardCamp"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["java","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Castle Runners","category":"jam","description":"This Is My First Game And Its A bit glitchy but Its fun!

So this is our try for the jam, hope you'll like it. With the theme \"Ancient technology\" as we got not that much experience, we tried to think in two ways : how to link the theme with the gameplay, and how to make the background coherent with those two.\nSo we though that gameplay will stick to the \"technology\" idea, with dungeons starring tools and technologies to use to finish the levels, inspired by some Zelda's design, and the \"Ancient\" part will be hold by lore, as the lovers of space opera we are, with an ancient civilization lost in time, kind of Stargate thing.\nOur game is (or try to be) a platformer with an enigma component, as the player will have to think and use technological tools to finish levels, each level showing a main mechanic. Yet, as I said, we're beginners, so we made only the first one in release, although we had ideas for the two next.\nWe had a lot of fun, problems, experience, arguments, and pride making this. Do not hesitate to criticize our work so we can improve, and I hope you'll enjoy.

A puzzle is represented on a single line (you can have multiple line in a single file). You have 10 numbers for the ropes followed by 10 numbers for the pulleys (0 there is no pulley, 1 there is a pulley). For the ropes, here is the encoding :\n\n0 = no rope\n\n1 = black rope\n\n2 = blue rope\n\n3 = green rope\n\n4 = orange rope\n\n5 = red rope\n\nExample :\n\n0 1 2 1 4 1 5 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThen, once you have your puzzle file, from the main menu, press P to go to the customized puzzle mode.

Slow down the spinning items to make identification easier, but slower speed means a lower score. Also gives you a humorous summary of your ancestors based on what you thought each item was.\n\nAbout:\nThis is my first LD entry, coded with the awesome Love2D, and although it's a simplistic game I'm happy to have got it into a working shape from scratch especially as I'm only just learning Lua.\n\nThe Good:\nEverything at least works even if the layout is a bit odd in places!\n\nThe Bad:\nI underestimated how much time would be needed to create pixel-art type images. As a result the amount of content is severely lacking. Appearance would have been improved greatly if I'd had time to use bit-mapped fonts rather than relying on a default system font. I would have liked to add more pzazz by way of effects etc but the game is a bit too simplistic to warrant it.\n\nAutopsy:\nHaving a better grasp of the language selected would have been useful! At least I learned how to package up Love2D programs for Windows, despite developing on a Linux box, and how to use the excellent Piskel in some detail.\n\n\nThe download is for Windows 64 bit (archive includes source)\n\nA source-only *.love file is available for Linux users (who will need to install Love2d to play it).\n\n\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/2776db1c7768a7777b0c9632d0753bcd.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=111534","author":{"name":"Traf d-Lo","uid":111534,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/daf54a1f6a9ebaff8acc5409e4a79930?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/traf-d-lo/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111534-shot0-1472397439.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111534-shot0-1472397439.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111534-shot1-1472397439.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/111534-shot1-1472397439.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/107017966/200generations_Windows_64bit.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/107017966/200generations.love"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/107017966/200generations.love"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux","mac"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"AfroRPG","category":"jam","description":"This is an RPG that is not fully completed.

Also, you can't use any other moves while you are in air. If the terrain is riddled with obstacles, you might want to consider a bridge instead.\n\nYou can hold down keys to do so. In fact, while you keep pressing <SHIFT>, you can't fall into chasms (provided that you have bridge segments in your inventory)\n\nSame thing counts for fire - keep holding <Q>, and fire can't hurt you. However, if you press <SHIFT> and <Q> at the same time, only the last button you pressed will be persistent. So you can't play superman by holding down both ;)\n\nThe hardest parts of the game are the double columns/saws, I think. These sequences are the randomly generated ones. However, you can beat them, if you double tap your movement keys quickly. (It's very hard, but possible, trust me)\n\nIt's also possible to do precision jumps to conserve bridge segments in some cases, but that requires a lot of skill to pull off :)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/038d0593ca13df7dd569c70b63a5c34d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=55795","author":{"name":"Vaiaphraim","uid":55795,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c90d33320002308c5e536156e347bd57?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/vaiaphraim/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/55795-shot0-1472435555.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/55795-shot0-1472435555.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/55795-shot1-1472548032.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/55795-shot1-1472548032.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/55795-shot2-1472548032.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/55795-shot2-1472548032.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/55795-shot3-1472548032.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/55795-shot3-1472548032.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/download/egzdik79jc4yng5/LD36_-_Temple_Quest_%5BSource%5D.rar"},{"label":".exe","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/download/m6mfuzf88ks2f6a/LD36_-_Temple_Quest_%28exe_version_-_unpack_fully_for_sound%21%29.rar"},{"label":".swf","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/download/hcats549wdduy1t/LD36_-_Temple_Quest_%28swf_version_-_unpack_fully_for_sound%21%29.rar"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop","win","web"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"The Human Drive For Innovation In The Realm Of Science","category":"compo","description":"One day a human at the top of a hill gave a rock a shove...\n\n\nRan out of time, oh well.

So comments with bugs/complaints/suggestions are appreciated :)\n--END NEWS--\n\nFirst day was spent on a completely different project which didn't pan out. In a panic I spent the last 29 hours getting this together. There's no real proper ending like I was hoping.

The UI may or may not have issues outside 16:9 but you're free to test that out.\n\nBy all accounts this /shouldn't/ work in wine, but if the linux version doesn't run for you by all means feel free to try.\nNotably, the windows version comes bundled with python3.5, but the linux builds do not. To play those you'll have to make sure you've got python3.x installed and that run_game.sh calls the appropriate python exec.\nIf someone wants me to get an OS X version up, hit me up on AfterNET or Freenode.

You can see about 5% of total game.\n\n  Controls: \na + d - moving\nw - jump\nspace - use doors (background doors when they are open)\nYou can cut the rope with sowrd to unlock new paths\n\n  Arch Journey is a game about 3 archeologists who went to a new unusual archeological site. When they arrived an earthquake happened. They fell down into an ancient catacomb. But only one survived. Chose your hero and help him escape this place and return home. You can chose between 3 tools (sword, hammer and bow) representing each of archeologists. Depending on this choice you'll have different paths of progressing through the game. In this game you'll have to solve puzzles, defend yourself from the ancients, find ancient spheres to improve your tool and finaly escape. Here is where your journey begins.\n\n  And to the sad part.. What did we implement.\nOne level, one hero (with sword), a couple of easy puzzles, one ancient sphere to improve your sword mastery, a couple of dummy enemies (no AI, sorry guys =( ). At least we got a solid dungeon atmosphere. It's a bit more of a prototype than actual game, but it's still was a lot of fun. We hope you'll enjoy our game. Leave feedback and have a nice day!

When you gathered enough, head back to your village to deposit your materials. If you collected enough stuff, you'll unlock a new technology.\n\nIf you've made it to tech level 2: CONGLATURATIONS !!! You've seen all there is to the game. Please don't try to gather for the tech-level after reaching level 2, because there is no new content waiting for you, just endless grinding and a crash upon reaching level 4. So don't do it.\n\n~REMARKS~\nI am pretty happy with the graphics and the overall style and maybe there's some future for this game since I had a whole bunch of ideas that wouldn't make it in the game, such as fighting against other clans and upgrading your weapons. If you spend too long on gathering than on upgrading the tech, the other tribes would suddenly have more advanced weapons than you, for example. Players would have had to balance fighting and gathering and what resources they spend for which domain.\n\nAnyways, I hope you enjoy it despite the clunky UI and lack of sound.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e479734f9dcc5914dd2aa17b6db75299.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=47131","author":{"name":"Phil Strahl","uid":47131,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c76dacb3ccf5978a23a4f60bd4401918?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/philstrahl/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/47131-shot0-1472435569.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/47131-shot0-1472435569.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/47131-shot1-1472435609.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/47131-shot1-1472435609.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/47131-shot2-1472434581.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/47131-shot2-1472434581.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/47131-shot3-1472434581.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/47131-shot3-1472434581.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.pixelprophecy.com/games/6210-b-c/downloads/6210-BC.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.pixelprophecy.com/games/6210-b-c/downloads/ld36-6210bc-source.gmz"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"A Fox's Pottery","category":"compo","description":"\nHello!\nThis is my Ludum Dare 36 Entry with the theme \"Ancient Technology\"\n\nWell my game is about a fox in a museum of ancient technology.\nIt's kinda short but I hope you like it anyways.\n\nControls:\n  Enter/Space or Mouse clicks: Skip through text\n  W/S/A/D or Up/Down/Left/Right: Movement\n\nMade in Java using libGDX\nGraphics made with ProMotion\nSounds made with bfxr\n\n\n(The web version may lag.

If you had a modem in your computer (this was not standard issue) then you could connect to someones computer running a BBS. ON the BBS you could chat, post messages to the message groups, download files (this was the best way to get shareware games) and play DOOR Games. Arena of Death is a homage to those DOOR Games. It is a text based arena combat simulator. Some of the stuff in it is based on D&D and other stuff was my own doing.\n\nNOTE: This is a keyboard driven game. The mouse is only used to select the input field to enter your name. \n\nNOTE2: A WebGL version is in the works as are MAC and Linux. I will remove this message when they are uploaded\n\n\nInside the game there are Instructions which I call tips. Here I wanted to present you with more of those tips.\n\n1. The armor class (AC) system is not based on D&D. You start out wearing Rags which has an AC of 0, so this mean you will get hit a lot and you may die a lot too. The AC System is simple the higher your AC the less you'll get hit.\n\n2. The entire game and fake BBS are written from the perspective of some who is really putting up a new BBS, which is why the Instructions in game refer to later updates.\n\n3. I recommend when you get enough money that you purchase armor first, Heavy Robes have an AC of 8, while it since great it should keep you alive longer.\n\n3. .50% of your strength is used in the calculation of damage, both regular and critical.\n\n4. .50% of your dexterity is used in the calculation to see whether the monster hits you.\n\n5. Both of these stats can be increased with potions.\n\n6. I say it in the Instructions and I want to repeat it here. When your character dies it will be deleted and you will have to create another one.\n\nI hope you all enjoy this glimpse into the past of a game from a bygone era. I truly had fun creating it and while I know it can be frustrating at times I hope you all have fun playing it. \n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/cd786d558cd1cb4f368db8fe4e8b930c.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=6464","author":{"name":"KunoNoOni","uid":6464,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/66939357d6de2a9fee4036a08e714ad1?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/kunonooni/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/6464-shot0-1472434436.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/6464-shot0-1472434436.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/6464-shot1-1472434436.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/6464-shot1-1472434436.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/6464-shot2-1472434436.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/6464-shot2-1472434436.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows x86","url":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/53747017/ArenaOfDeath/ArenaOfDeath.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/KunoNoOni/ArenaOfDeath"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Cat Ball VR","category":"jam","description":"Cat Ball VR is a super short VR experience for the Vive. \n\nTrigger warning:\n- It contains kitten\n- Moving camera - might cause VR motion sickness\n\nControl:\n- D-pad for movement.

You have no interval, and will need to use this to your advantage\n-Step into the Gold Ring at the front of each house/fort/monastery, then press 'E' to Loot and Set Fire to it.\n-Retreat to the World Map by going back to the Gold Ring at your ship\n-Use your loot to Upgrade your Stats, Health is Health, Attack is Attack, and Defense is Divided by 10 and Subtracted from the Enemy Attack\n-When you're Dead, you're Dead. You aren't coming back.\n\nHope you like my really, reeally bad Art!\n\n~KNOWN BUGS~\n-Colliders are Wonky, and it's Easy to Glitch your way in and out of the map. Thankfully the Enemies can't.\n-UI Scaling on the World Map.

Manage workers and resources to build the Great Pyramid of Giza in the least amount of time.\n\nHOW TO PLAY:\n- BTGP is played mostly with the mouse.\n- Manage resources with three different buildings: Houses, Farms and Stone Quarries.\n- Houses increase your worker population as well as food costs.\n- Farms can produce food. However you must assign workers to the farm to start producing. In addition food can be sold for silver, which is used to build/upgrade new facilities.\n- Stone Quarries can produce stone blocks. Similarly to farms, the number of blocks produced depends on how many workers are assigned.\n- You win the game when you have placed the 2.3 million blocks. Don't let your workers starve or they will abandon you and stop the construction!\n- Good luck!\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/0fea3d8c181a7ed1012b25d9a7ac1749.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=56230","author":{"name":"AndreSilvs","uid":56230,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f3c9ee9e97a39bd60143af64485a8201?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/andresilvs/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/56230-shot0-1472435914.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/56230-shot0-1472435914.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/56230-shot1-1472440107.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/56230-shot1-1472440107.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0hJL_Jwk3OdZXI5UHB4UDNMVEU"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"Cave Wars","category":"jam","description":"Cave Wars is a tower defense game that let’s you send out troops to attack your neighbour’s cave.

Ku","category":"jam","description":" - Hunab ku - The Only God -\n\nIn Hunab Ku you help a lost Mayan deity to bring the world into ruin.\n\nHe is trying to use ancient sundials to restore his power. By rotating the disks in the correct manner the power of the heavens will be yours.\n\nThe catch is? There are some constructions on the dials that make it hard for certain disks to move. Using keys to unlock doors and sliders to move towers around prepare to get dizzy with Hunab Ku.\n\n\n-- THE IDEA --\n\n\nI set out to make a puzzle game that could very well be played on a mobile platform. With that in mind the game quickly grew a bit to large for the mobile.(stuff got to big). But it would be able to work for a tablet! (After some ui element adjustments.\n\nI liked to make a puzzle game sometime ago that was going to be centered around Circular motion. I never fleshed it out and it stayed like a coaster idea. \n\nWhilst I wasn't as pleased with this theme as I Like the more abstract themes, I am realy amazed by the results (it might be because of lack of sleep).\n\nI hope you have fun playing the game as much as I had fun making it.\n\n\n-FAILED ITEMS-\n\nWhat I did not manage to do was the following.\n\nHud elements... Always hud elements \n\nAnd credits. That is about it.\n\n--KNOWN BUGS--\n\n- Sometimes a ring with a pilar will slip past a wall when releasing it next to a wall (Solution know No time to implement yet)\n\n- Sometimes when disconecting/connecting a key the doors dont respond. Reconnecting the key should work but it costs you a move.\n\n- Some of the introduction text is to long and goes off the screen. No story for you :<\n\n- Getting all 3 coins on a level should be difficult. Right now you can trivialize it by doing one turn with the golden rings and one turn without but below minimum movements. Going to check if you have the golden rings connected before you can get the minimum movements completion. This should make the last few levels harder to fully complete for you puzzlers out there.\n\n==DEVNOTE==\n\nI will try and fix the last few bugs this week so it will be buggless next weekend. I wil also make an Android APK of the game (in portrait mode) for you to play. Both for Tablet and mobile devices. This requires abit of UI layout changes but no gameplay changes. It should idealy be played on those devices so I think the game would be loads more fun after that.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/cefad91f6cfccde74c2ba606e8741e97.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=28743","author":{"name":"taaboo","uid":28743,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/07d8b2b1b15a35535a55469eb3d71e7b?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/taaboo/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/28743-shot0-1472517941.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/28743-shot0-1472517941.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/28743-shot1-1472517941.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/28743-shot1-1472517941.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/28743-shot2-1472517941.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/28743-shot2-1472517941.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwLSlD7-3CBSVXlIWWNiZUdDZjg/view?usp=sharing"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwLSlD7-3CBSZjktZExScTZvd00/view?usp=sharing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"iTech","category":"jam","description":"Crash Landed on a foreign planet, teach the locals how to build so you can call for your people!!!\n\nGather resources to build the pyramids by finding the resources on map, mind control the cavemen and choose for them to find more resources or help build the pyramids to aid your escape off the planet.\n\nAlso, fight crocodiles.\n\n** Controls **\n\nLMB for laser, Laser against Cavemen will hypnotize.

as a team you will need to google a chart that will help you decode the Morse code and you'll need a pen and paper to write down the answer, this could also work well played through a stream so someone viewing could decode the morse.\n\nMy original Intention was to include a document with the download which included a chart but time got the better of me i will try to add this at later date.\n\nThe Game was built with Shoot Em Up Kit, a program i have been using a lot for jamming recently and i really like it you can create a lot more than just Shmups with it.\n\nThe Graphics where done in Photoshop and everything else was built in Shoot Em Up Kit's Particle Editor.\n\nThe Sound was Made with a Morse Code Gen and Magix\n\nControls - just cursors and left Ctrl or you can play with a pad (Alot Harder)\n\nIf Playing alone Headphones Reccomended.\n\nThis game was a bit experimental and was fun to put

Arrows will disappear when they have been stepped on 3 times.\n\nKill all explorers to complete the level, and don't let any of them get to your crypt on the right side of the screen!\n\nCREDITS\n\n=======\n\nGame made by Rodrigo [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */' Diaz and Eduardo [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */_' Alonso for the Ludum Dare 36.\n\nThanks to Mechanical Boss @MechanicalBoss for providing the physical place for doing the jam!\n\nSound effects by:\n\nLittle Robot Sound Factory - http://www.littlerobotsoundfactory.com\n\nMichel Baradari - http://www.apollo-music.de/\n\nMusic by:\n\nCasePortman Musing - https://soundcloud.com/kc_portman/","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/bdf4201f886a2a69f9b2d0060420cf5d.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=90767","author":{"name":"r2d2rigo","uid":90767,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5646f6ae991c28d072e16ea19f717180?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/r2d2rigo/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/90767-shot0-1472504749.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/90767-shot0-1472504749.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/90767-shot1-1472504749.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/90767-shot1-1472504749.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/90767-shot2-1472504749.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/90767-shot2-1472504749.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/90767-shot3-1472504749.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/570486/90767-shot3-1472504749.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"https://itch.io/embed-upload/264604?color=333333"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://r2d2rigo.itch.io/revenge-of-tutankhamun"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"https://r2d2rigo.itch.io/revenge-of-tutankhamun"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://r2d2rigo.itch.io/revenge-of-tutankhamun"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":36,"title":"War party","category":"jam","description":"War party PROTOTYPE.\n\nIts the end of the dark ages and you must Lead a war party.
