Transcend is a game about an 'X' key trying to find direction, and later meaning.

Otherwise, all other controls available to you are always shown on screen.\n\nNOTE: Level 6 (the level after you unlock '[R]everse') is somewhat too difficult. Use Shift-Enter to skip it if you can't find the solution - it's a shame people aren't seeing the final few levels because they are getting stuck.\n\nFlash game, so should run on everything.

Pings!","category":"compo","description":"The player is in a small scout vessel exploring a \"dark\" area in space. No normal scanners work here so the ships must use a very powerful active scanner (the technical name is Pinger) to detect things in their surrounding. The use of the Pinger can be detected from a long range, putting the user in danger if enemies are near. But if you don't use it you can't see...\n\nControls are WASD (no need to hold W) and SPACE triggers the Pinger. To fire missiles click somewhere in the window. If you click on a visible enemy the missile will track it, otherwise it'll detonate in the area you clicked. Use WASD or arrow keys to navigate the menus. Enter selects an option.\n\nThe game was developed for Windows using C# in VS2010 with XNA 4.0, so you'll need the .NET and XNA frameworks to play. Graphics were done with Paint.NET and sounds with sfxr. Font used (Quartz MS) is one of those included in the XNA framework.\n\n\nEdit:\nMake sure you have XNA 4.0. Link to runtime installer:\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=a88c6dec-aeae-42cd-a108-d35c013c3b97&displaylang=en\n\nEdit2:\nAdded link to a new version. Only difference is that you now can control the ship with the arrow keys as well as WASD, and the pinger can be activated with the right mouse button as well as Space.\n\nEdit3:\nThe \"arrow keys\" version has been updated and should be using XNA's Reach profile. This means it should now run on non DirectX 10 GPU's.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/6c2e3264f3ba8e19ba82ef209b3ef3d8.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-19/?action=preview&uid=3153","author":{"name":"idgar","uid":3153,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3567f1dc11819a2cdbeb332ccfaf8d83?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/idgar/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3153-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3153-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3153-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3153-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://rsp.mine.nu/idgar/SpacePings.zip"},{"label":"Windows (arrow keys)","url":"http://rsp.mine.nu/idgar/SpacePingsArrows.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://rsp.mine.nu/idgar/SpacePingsSource.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":61,"score":9},{"area":"community","rank":68,"score":3.3},{"area":"innovation","rank":69,"score":3.2},{"area":"fun","rank":72,"score":3},{"area":"theme","rank":72,"score":3.4},{"area":"audio","rank":82,"score":2.7},{"area":"overall","rank":89,"score":3},{"area":"graphics","rank":100,"score":3},{"area":"humor","rank":136,"score":2}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":19,"title":"Space Station","category":"compo","description":"This is a top-down exploration game where you walk around as a red pixel exploring a space station.

The goal? To buy your very own space ship... so that you can take your rover to even more alien planets.\n\nHas more features than I thought it would, including randomly generated maps, gathering minerals, selling them at the drop site, refining certain minerals into fuel, buying fuel when you run low, and getting towed back to camp if you aren't careful!\n\nI do not know how balanced the game is in terms of money/fuel availability and pricing. Might be too easy or hard to win. Also did not have a lot of time to test for bugs in this final build, so there are likely to be a few.\n\nEither way, though, I think it's a complete game and it can be pretty entertaining! Planning to shine it up a little bit post-compo and see how good I can make it.\n\n=== Known Issues ===\n* Discovery counter on the panel is meant to count total discoveries collected and sold. In RC4, it only counts discoveries currently carried (this worked better in an earlier version where you could not sell anything).\n\n* Very hard to reach $10000 goal unless you get very lucky. Takes more than half your fuel to reach some areas of the map, making a round trip impossible.\n\n* Money/fuel value and relative drop rate of minerals is generally poorly balanced, contributing to the difficulty issues.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b8820dc1cf5c0261a0544422d754950e.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-19/?action=preview&uid=3311","author":{"name":"JohnColburn","uid":3311,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4dcfdc9a14e9187514be2917aa904835?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/johncolburn/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3311-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3311-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3311-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3311-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3311-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3311-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3311-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3311-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://john-colburn.com/DiscoFiveRC4Win32.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://john-colburn.com/DiscoFiveRC4.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://john-colburn.com/DiscoFiveRC4.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":15,"score":4.07},{"area":"overall","rank":25,"score":3.64},{"area":"fun","rank":33,"score":3.5},{"area":"innovation","rank":68,"score":3.21},{"area":"humor","rank":77,"score":2.57},{"area":"community","rank":80,"score":3.17},{"area":"graphics","rank":94,"score":3.07},{"area":"coolness","rank":150,"score":2}],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":19,"title":"Explosive Transcendental Circulatory System","category":"compo","description":"Here's a thing.

Hopefully the skills we learned and adapted will help us complete the next challenge on time.\n\nAnyway, we hope you enjoy playing the game!

I've always wanted to write a toboggan simulator, where you can speed down a snowy hill on a sled, dodging trees and smashing into snowmen.  This weekend's game jams finally gave me the chance.  Check it out!  I would love to read your comments and warmly encourage you to let me know what you think.\n\nUse the arrow keys to go left and right, and try to take out as many snowmen as you can!\n\nIn this game, you are immortal.  It was created for fun, and no matter what happens you can always climb back to the top of the hill and start again.  There is a hint of danger, however: if you smash into a tree or hit the thin ice signs, you might get flipped over!  If you do get flipped over, simply hit the [Click to restart] button on the top left.\n\nThe objective of the game is to \"discover\" gravity, prove that snowmen are not at all \"immortal\", and avoid the \"thin ice\" while gravity is constantly \"drawing\" you to the bottom of the hill.  These words have quotes around them because those were the secret theme words for the game jams I participated in.\n\nThis game was programmed using FlashDevelop for a pure as3 project, compiled using Flex, and the engines are away3d for graphics, jiglib for physics and Flint for particle effects.  All sounds were created by me using a microphone.  The guitar and snow sounds were done with my hands and mouth, and the sliding snow sound was the microphone rubbing up against my winter jacket.  It was an absolute blast to program and I learned a lot.  Thanks for playing.

Would say more but that'd ruin it.\n\nEPILEPSY WARNING: Contains flashing lights that may cause seizure.\n\nControls:\n-Arrow Keys to Move and Jump\n-X to skid\n\nNOTE: You walljump further when not holding UP, but higher when you are holding UP.  Useful to traverse certain areas.\n\nSPOILER (story):\nA few people told me that the flashing epileptic screens aren't very readable.  Here's the dialogue if you can't read it:\n\n\"Do you remember?\"\n\"When you were young and healthy\"\n\"But now you're overdosing on meds\"\n\"I'll prescribe something; you can be happy!\"\n\"This isn't real, don't listen to them\"\n\"You are hallucinating, you are a dying old man in a hospital\"\n\"It is time to go back\"\n\nIt still probably makes no sense.\n\nSPOILER (walkthrough):\nSome people are having trouble with some parts of the game, so if you need help see below.\n\nGo to the right and pick up the Jump medication.  Move all the way to the right of the map and pick up the Walljump medication.  Walljump up the blocks and go to your left, to the shaft you passed earlier.  Walljump up the shaft and pick up the Skid medication.  Walljump to the alcove in the left of the shaft.  While holding X, jump up (tap UP twice) without holding any other arrow keys).  You should slide onto the ledge to your right.  While holding X, jump over the gaps.  (One of the blocks actually has a messed-up bounding box, so you'll have to jump earlier).  Pick up the rocketjump upgrade to your right.\n\nAfter getting the rocketjump upgrade, jump over the edge to your left and hold DOWN to charge it.  You should shoot straight up and enter a little alcove with the Brush medication inside.  Then rocketjump down the central tunnel that you walljumped up earlier.\n\nGo to your left through the brush and down the mini-maze thing.  Go to your right and jump off, holding DOWN to charge up your rocketjump.\n\nThis part takes some skill; you should reach an L shaped block when you jump up.  Hug the wall and press UP to walljump off of it (but don't hold RIGHT; that'll kill your speed).  Hold X and skid across the platforms.  Make sure to jump on the last platform too.  As soon as you jump off the second platform, hold DOWN to charge up your rocketjump and land in the tunnel.  You should end up going straight up.  When you reach the upper-left corner, walljump off of it (again, not holding LEFT) and hold X to skid across the blocks.\n\nSkid as far to the right as you can until you reach a bottle of medication.  Pick that up.  Lastly, rocketjump up the shaft again, go down the mini-maze, rocketjump off the ledge to your left, and go through the tunnel that was closed up earlier to get the last bottle of medication.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/26534498c706352832e13482b469407f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-19/?action=preview&uid=3051","author":{"name":"ThatSnail","uid":3051,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/05b020d2dfebd66e71ab71a55836646f?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/thatsnail/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3051-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3051-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3051-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3051-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3051-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3051-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/971393/Trip.swf"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/971393/Trip.swf"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/971393/Trip_source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":61,"score":9},{"area":"humor","rank":66,"score":2.7},{"area":"audio","rank":77,"score":2.77},{"area":"overall","rank":98,"score":2.96},{"area":"graphics","rank":119,"score":2.85},{"area":"community","rank":119,"score":2.79},{"area":"fun","rank":121,"score":2.7},{"area":"innovation","rank":126,"score":2.7},{"area":"theme","rank":156,"score":2.81}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":19,"title":"Alphabet Trader","category":"compo","description":"Developed and tested extensively on Windows 7, should also work on Windows Vista and XP with provided libraries.

And then I saw the Land Rover Discovery series and thought hey I can make a little racing game with land rovers (my cars were based off the 4th series). Now not being a programmer I thought making a little racing game would be hard, but I also thought it would be simple. Which at times it was, but others not so much.\n\nThis is the first time I've ever made a racing game (as it's probably quite easy to tell) and so I decided to try and keep it similar to one of my all time favourites Indy 500 (Atari 2600) as even with it's extremely simplistic nature it could keep you entertained. So I tried a similar approach.\n\nSadly I had a lot go wrong on me especially last minute (as it always happens then) which has caused my entry to only have on piece of sound sadly, making this my first entry that lacks on sound. As well as that my art isn't as good as it could be, and I spent no time on the tracks. Also after testing the file uploading works I noticed the vehicles could have been sped down a little.\n\nOverall though I do enjoy playing it, and I'm happy with how it turned out, needs a bit of tweaks here and there and a load of polish and I'll be very happy with it.\n\nAnywho to keep with the feel of Indy 500 I've made it available for multiple people to play (and sadly the one player is only one track due to lots of problems) so you can play on your own or have 2-4 players, the instructions screen shows the controls which consist of a variety of keyboard buttons.\n\nThere is no end to the game, just have some fun racing round the laps.\n\nLand Rover Discovery Challenge was made in Game Maker 8 and has been tested on Windows 7 (64bit)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d7e2d7b457019ce657cf4276a04782f4.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-19/?action=preview&uid=1396","author":{"name":"Catmoo","uid":1396,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/60bc16bfca73e31e681037917d00f6fa?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/catmoo/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/1396-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/1396-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/1396-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/1396-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/1396-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/1396-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.catmoo.co.uk/land_rover_discovery_challenge_by_catherine_woolley.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.catmoo.co.uk/land_rover_discovery_challenge_source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":45,"score":3.56},{"area":"humor","rank":94,"score":2.4},{"area":"graphics","rank":114,"score":2.88},{"area":"fun","rank":133,"score":2.63},{"area":"audio","rank":154,"score":1.82},{"area":"overall","rank":170,"score":2.5},{"area":"theme","rank":193,"score":2.33},{"area":"innovation","rank":201,"score":2},{"area":"coolness","rank":201,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":19,"title":"mindeeper","category":"compo","description":"Plot: You are an alien therapist from outer space hired to clean your patients minds from traumas.

Coding this game was quite an intense experience, with many dirty short-cuts that needed to be taken as the deadline loomed ever closer.\n\nCorners were cut pretty early in day two, soon resorting to whole sides being lopped off the project by evening. My greatest regret is that I didn't get to add sound to the project.\n\nI'm not expecting this game to be judged well, but the competition was an awesome personal challenge and hopefully my next LD will be of competitive quality. This was an awesome experience, and the guys in irc were a fun bunch.\n\nOh and for those that read the source: Forgive me my sins.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWindows version created, the port required me to fix a stack over flow error. I have included a bug fix version of my original linux submission. Game play for all three versions of the game is identical.\n\nKnown Bugs:\n\n- The maze generator breaks about 1 in 10 maze generations, and produces false walls. I would have hoped the bug was rare enough to not affect most peoples game play, but those it did affect assumed it was part of the discovery theme (it's a feature!)\n\n- I left some console debug info in by mistake, which could help you escape a floor if only you knew the co-ordinates where you started.\n\n- Rooms all look similar, not enough bodies etc. are all due to everything being generated by an unbiased random number generator. Bodies spawn with a 1 in 3 chance per room, and each room contains either a pick-axe, rail track, or crystal at a random orientation. I put that in a minute before the deadline, so it was very much a rush job. It does however look much better than the alternative of featureless black rooms.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c466d603f6e1e7140dfe80c2c96cfc59.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-19/?action=preview&uid=2771","author":{"name":"ShineSyndrome","uid":2771,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b19cd4d697f7f4c099834fdf43c3f5de?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/shinesyndrome/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/2771-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/2771-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/2771-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/2771-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Linux + Source","url":"http://sites.google.com/site/jiltedgamer/ld48-19/Panacea%2BSource.tar.gz?attredirects=0&d=1"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://sites.google.com/site/jiltedgamer/ld48-19/Panaceawin.zip?attredirects=0&d=1"},{"label":"Linux BUGFIX","url":"http://sites.google.com/site/jiltedgamer/ld48-19/Panacea%2BSourceBUGFIX.tar.gz?attredirects=0&d=1"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":36},{"area":"community","rank":118,"score":2.8},{"area":"theme","rank":121,"score":3},{"area":"humor","rank":136,"score":2},{"area":"overall","rank":177,"score":2.46},{"area":"fun","rank":180,"score":2.23},{"area":"innovation","rank":189,"score":2.17},{"area":"graphics","rank":224,"score":1.85}],"platforms":["linux","desktop","win"]},{"ld_issue":19,"title":"Quarters","category":"compo","description":"Ok!

So this is is basically meaningless.)\n\nYrevoc Sid--a planet within the Goldilocks zone of its mother star. Circa 2031, humankind turned its telescopes to examine it. Life, it appeared, existed (and perhaps even flourished) on this world. It boasted an atmosphere identical to Earth's, and water lay across nearly seventy percent of its surface. Scientists began planning missions to investigate this planet, with the ultimate goal of determining just how much life there was. But the third World War interrupted this potential discovery.\n\nAll research was diverted to the various war efforts. Invented were vast numbers of missiles, satellites, and firearms. Yrevoc Sid was soon forgotten. It was by lucky chance that the nuclear phase-out program had been completed two months prior to the war's beginning; humanity could have easily made itself extinct. After the resolution of this three-decade war, a global government was formed. What was once military technology was now pointed to the stars.\n\nLush, wild planets were quickly found. They were more plentiful than any pre-war scientist had ever dreamed. However, one thing that was never found was sentient life. No planet showed any signs of civilization. Therefore, it entered the common wisdom that humans were the only species to bear this remarkable trait.\n\nAfter decades of this era of faster-than-light space travel passed, a researcher had a hunch. Back on the now insignificant, war-torn Earth. A man by the name of Robert Case had found the records of Yrevoc Sid. Case observed a discrepancy--recent scans of the planet had revealed very little water, and absolutely no signs of life. He found it odd that a planet should seem so lush before the war, but truly be so barren. Obviously, a research grant would never be issued to persue a trifling misalignment like this, so the researcher set out on his own, unfunded and under the radar.\n\nRobert Case returned to humankind a hero.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ff963c78ecbe66f082a75ec9899e7cfc.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-19/?action=preview&uid=1712","author":{"name":"31eee384","uid":1712,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7e2b7c885cfa6c044bd14500052d2060?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/31eee384/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/1712-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/1712-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web (Applet)","url":"http://www.galacticgaming.net/hosting/ludum/ld19/bin/pl.html"},{"label":"Download (Executable Jar)","url":"http://www.galacticgaming.net/hosting/ludum/ld19/dist/YrevocSid.jar"},{"label":"Web (Applet, Jam version)","url":"http://galacticgaming.net/ys/bin/pl.html"},{"label":"Download (Executable Jar, Linux, no sound)","url":"http://galacticgaming.net/ys/dist/YrevocSid_linux_nosound.jar"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.galacticgaming.net/hosting/ludum/ld19/LD19_src_YrevocSid.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":35,"score":3.73},{"area":"fun","rank":67,"score":3.06},{"area":"coolness","rank":70,"score":8},{"area":"innovation","rank":89,"score":3.06},{"area":"graphics","rank":90,"score":3.11},{"area":"overall","rank":118,"score":2.82},{"area":"humor","rank":130,"score":2.1},{"area":"theme","rank":164,"score":2.76},{"area":"audio","rank":175,"score":1.38}],"platforms":["web","desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":19,"title":"Observatory","category":"compo","description":"A visit to your Great Uncles' Observatory takes a strange twist.

For the three days to work on this jam, I had about 3 hours each day for coding.  Josh who did the art did a kick ass job.  I wish I had more time to code to really make use of all the great artwork he did.  (minus the ugly flame sprite, I did that at the last second, so don't blame Josh!)\n\nSo basically this game loads and you hit space to go through the title, credits, and story boards.  Once in the main game you select two alien coins to switch places to try to get 3 or more coins in a row.  The radiation symbol was suppose to deal damage to the alien you are competing against, but that didn't make it into the game.\n\nI didn't get time to do the Alien AI, so you basically just get to have fun getting rid of coins and such until you get bored.  But we felt in the spirit of the Jam, we should upload what we have finished.\n\nThe game was coded in Visual C++, using SDL for portability. Graphics were done with Photoshop.  Sound effects were done with sfxr.\n\nWe are going to finish the game as we have time to work on it.  For the finished game we will furnish binaries for Windows , Linux and Mac.\n\nThe Jam was a lot of fun and we look forward to the next one, and hope to have more time for it.\n\nMike & Josh\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e4387547d3224fbf2cea39ff8153829f.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-19/?action=preview&uid=3151","author":{"name":"deathtongue","uid":3151,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8def1df2eece622077381b13f1780f2e?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/deathtongue/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3151-shot0.bmp"},{"thumbnail_url":"","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3151-shot1.bmp"},{"thumbnail_url":"","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3151-shot2.bmp"},{"thumbnail_url":"","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3151-shot3.bmp"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.hillsoftware.com/worldrisk.rar"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":89,"score":6}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":19,"title":":ORE:","category":"compo","description":"Instructions are provided in the USER MANUAL that comes with the game. Due to running out of time, there are no-instructions or story in game (both are talked about in the manul).\n\n-Taken from part 1 of the manual-\n\"It's the 24th of January, 1848, and you've just received news of the Californian Gold Rush. Seeking fortunes galore, despite your old age, you set off to find said gold.\n\tUnfortunately due to poor eyesight and a slight senility, you find yourself, not in California, but in Costa-Rica! (Disclaimer; randomly generated foliage may or may not represent that of Costa-Rica). Seeing as you've made such a big trip, you decide you might as well do some diggin' anyways, and to your great surprise much more valuable and unknown metals are waiting for you to discover.\"\n\nSeeing as it is a high-score game (without a high-score system :P ), to see most of the game you simply have to play a bit then die, but there are some interesting mechanics that aren't talked about, so I recommend a couple plays. I also highly recommend you read the manual, I put a lot of hard work into it! Also, due to the randomized nature of this game, some levels are very hard whereas others are very easy, so be forewarned!\n\nI realize the use of the theme is very vague; the original concept was randomly generated ores (they still are) with random stats (not any more) that you could craft stuff with, so you'd be constantly discovering new exciting ores. (the only relic from that phase is the random colors). So when I had to change the whole idea of the game, I didn't have much time to re-incorporate it. The Theme lives on however in the story: you've uncovered a bountiful deposit of new metals; go get-em!\n\nSo yeah, I hope you enjoy the game, I certainly enjoyed making it (most of the time), and I'll see you all for the voting phase!\n\nEDIT: I forgot an important thing in the manual:\n\nKNOWN BUGS:\nsometimes the \"RETURN TO SURFACE\" thing just doesn't appear.\n\nEDIT2:\nuploaded a new version where ores no longer spawn in the walls, as this rendered the game unplayable 50% of the time.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/71cbbe222457a9d41bad3088e3ffa960.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-19/?action=preview&uid=1548","author":{"name":"moltanem2000","uid":1548,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bc0958bb6c3cafd4d2584c2e6bf728aa?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/mortar/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/1548-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/1548-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows (3.79 MB)","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?xcsqpkmbywj17ff"},{"label":"Source (2.61 MB)","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?7k28c8rktxu7eyc"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":4,"score":4.2},{"area":"graphics","rank":49,"score":3.45},{"area":"overall","rank":59,"score":3.3},{"area":"fun","rank":82,"score":2.95},{"area":"humor","rank":107,"score":2.27},{"area":"innovation","rank":109,"score":2.85},{"area":"audio","rank":131,"score":2.18},{"area":"theme","rank":143,"score":2.9},{"area":"coolness","rank":201,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":19,"title":"BoxMiner","category":"compo","description":"","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b7e3396e1da0bab155764f4ba35fc2f0.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-19/?action=preview&uid=3499","author":{"name":"Club559","uid":3499,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2af032099ba981b342c26ae7af9cc05d?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/club559/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3499-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3499-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6436787/BoxMiner.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":68,"score":3.3},{"area":"humor","rank":124,"score":2.13},{"area":"theme","rank":149,"score":2.86},{"area":"coolness","rank":181,"score":1},{"area":"overall","rank":217,"score":2},{"area":"innovation","rank":219,"score":1.85},{"area":"graphics","rank":222,"score":1.86},{"area":"fun","rank":223,"score":1.71}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":19,"title":"Colony Tycoon","category":"compo","description":"The original idea of this game is that you play as a robot scouting new locations for human colonies to see what things you can find.\n\nDue to my own procrastination this is unfortunately not as finished as I would have liked.\n\nControls:\nUp/Down/Left/Right move robot\nEsc toggle inventory screen\n\nWhen the time runs out it will show your inventory screen and you may restart by pressing escape.\n\nThe arrow points back towards the ship.\n\nI am hoping to improve this entry for the jam.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/289fdfa7742455568887496bb63845f0.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-19/?action=preview&uid=2437","author":{"name":"Andrew Marsh","uid":2437,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8a2f265648ad81ab0890f4f3be88cf0d?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/andrew-marsh/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/2437-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/2437-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/2437-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/2437-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10426165/colony%20tycoon.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10426165/colony%20tycoon.tar.gz"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10426165/colony%20tycoon.tar.gz"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":121,"score":3},{"area":"innovation","rank":201,"score":2},{"area":"coolness","rank":201,"score":0},{"area":"graphics","rank":216,"score":2},{"area":"community","rank":219,"score":1.43},{"area":"overall","rank":227,"score":1.88},{"area":"fun","rank":235,"score":1.5}],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":19,"title":"Disco?

I don't have unity pro, however, so I don't think it'll work exactly right.  But that's the best I can do!\n\nThank you all so much for reading this, participating with me, and playing my game.  Special thanks to Sophie Houlden!  I wish you all the best of luck, I'm really excited to play some of those games!!!\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/37519d8c3af8bc14a22d6836bcfb759e.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-19/?action=preview&uid=3391","author":{"name":"hsmith","uid":3391,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/da94c4b7161cd418f4ff3bfcccd872b5?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/hsmith/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3391-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3391-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3391-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3391-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3391-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3391-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3391-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3391-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.blacktriangles.com/bin/discovery/v7/win.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://www.blacktriangles.com/bin/discovery/v7/mac.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.blacktriangles.com/wp/personal/discovery/discovery-v7/"},{"label":"Post Comp","url":"http://www.blacktriangles.com/wp/personal/discovery/discovery-post-competition/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.blacktriangles.com/bin/discovery/v6/mothership_assets.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":11,"score":4},{"area":"coolness","rank":49,"score":11},{"area":"theme","rank":112,"score":3.1},{"area":"audio","rank":126,"score":2.26},{"area":"fun","rank":145,"score":2.53},{"area":"overall","rank":147,"score":2.65},{"area":"graphics","rank":154,"score":2.55},{"area":"innovation","rank":162,"score":2.4},{"area":"humor","rank":184,"score":1.64}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","web"]},{"ld_issue":19,"title":"Planet Thing","category":"compo","description":"Here's my jammy entry.

So instead theres a \"discovery\" in the win screen.\n\nYour base and hero are in your HUD, click the hud icons to zoom to them. Each time you start the game, you are randomly assigned a race (human, undead, elf) and a class (warrior, mage, king).\n\nClick your hero to select him, click adjacent hexes to set up your move path. Heroes have between 3-4 movement hexes a turn. When you wish to make your move click the End Turn button.\n\nWhen your hero is on your home base you can transfer units from your base to your hero by clicking on the base (try to click on the part exposed behind your hero). ALSO, make sure your hero is not selected when you do this :P\n\nFrom here you can go into troop management to get more units.\n\nYour goal is to find and kill all the other heroes on the map.\n\nWith the features as rough as they are, and no fog of war I kept the generated hex map small, easy enough to complete the game if you stock up on units first.\n\nIf you liked the idea, or the attempted execution stay keep an eye on my posts for a timelapse and post-mortem. \n\nThanks for taking a look!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e6f5e107716d5af62a746b9da72e7e93.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-19/?action=preview&uid=3457","author":{"name":"ACodeGerm","uid":3457,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7e3e73cd3615acf31604d16708654b9e?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/acodegerm/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3457-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3457-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3457-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3457-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3457-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/33232/3457-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.blurrycode.com/LD_19_Discovery%20-%20HOMMage.html"},{"label":"Post-Comp Build","url":"http://www.blurrycode.com/LD_19_Discovery%20-%20HOMMage-POST.html"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY55gj7rGhQ"},{"label":"Narrated Playthrough","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7wUw3lXspc"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.blurrycode.com/HOMMage_Competition_Source.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":2,"score":4.33},{"area":"coolness","rank":46,"score":12},{"area":"humor","rank":136,"score":2},{"area":"innovation","rank":187,"score":2.18},{"area":"audio","rank":197,"score":1},{"area":"overall","rank":201,"score":2.18},{"area":"graphics","rank":206,"score":2.18},{"area":"fun","rank":219,"score":1.76},{"area":"theme","rank":226,"score":1.94}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":19,"title":"Lurker","category":"compo","description":"Lurker is a top down stealth action game.
