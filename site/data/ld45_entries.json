Click `place` and drag it to the desired spot (or click the spot directly if it's empty). Click an occupied spot and then use the remove or rotate buttons at the top left as desired. Once your ship has a cockpit, click `to combat` to proceed to the battle!  \n(**Post-Compo edition**): Select your part from the right. Left click an open slot to place it. Left click an occupied slot to rotate the part, or right click to remove it. Once your ship has a cockpit, click `to combat` to proceed to the battle!\n\n\nCombat mode:\n- WASD: strafe\n- QE: rotate\n- Space: attack\n\n------\n\nTips:\n- This game is half physics sandbox, half puzzle, and half arcade. Different levels exercise different halves and require different approaches.\n- Every thruster only fires in one direction. Plan out your thrusters relative to the center of gravity for best control. For example: putting your forward thrusters along the center of mass will allow you to move forward without rotating.\n- The only thrusters that can rotate are those that are facing sideways. Put these far from the center of mass for maximum effectiveness\n- More parts means more mass. More mass means more thrusters required for the same acceleration!\n- Don't be afraid to press the \"give up\" button! Sometimes all you need is a little tweak :wink:\n- You got this! :smiley: \n\n------\n\nPost Compo Changelog:\n* Simplified ship builder - removed buttons, drag/drop and use left/right click instead\n* Added particles for projectile hit effect\n* Partially fixed UI scaling\n* (**Post-Compo Easy Mode build only**) Modified the thrusters so that they can fire in any direction, giving much greater control over the ship's movement and greatly reducing the difficulty of the game's puzzles. Play this mode if you can't beat the normal mode!\n\n![UI screen.png](///raw/169/z/28842.png)\n\n![preview.png](///raw/169/z/28846.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//169/z/267b8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/armistice","author":{"name":"frenchie","uid":2401,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//169/z/4949.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/frenchie"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//169/z/28842.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//169/z/28842.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//169/z/28846.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//169/z/28846.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/maxbize/LD45"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/ladigqv6shp7wex/Armistice%20LD%2045%20Windows.zip?dl=1"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://frenchie14.itch.io/armistice"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/n7aw1jda9obrih6/Armistice%20Post%20Compo%20Easy%20Controls.zip?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Barterin' Buckaroo","category":"jam","description":"You're the rootin-est tootin-est cowboy known to Swamp Gulch... that is until you gambled away all your cowboy-ly possessions in a night of cards and drinking. \n\nMake your way through town.

Yeah we sure do, having fun with your friends while making a game, sleeping over and even cooking food. These are the experiences i will treasure in my life and Ludum Dare has been a great contribution to this. I am grateful to have such wonderful friends and i am happy to be able to spend this time with them doing what i love.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but the challenge is what i am here for, learning new things and improving oneself is what i consider being a core of a human being, and events such as this are very helpful. Compared to the last Ludum Dare, i realized that we have done much more in 2 days than we have done in 3 days last Jam, and every time, our projects are getting better, step by step we are going to achieve our dream of making games\"\n\nAnion_Z - \"We had to sacrifice some parts of the game and the game feel overall to finish such huge project, even with 3 programmers it was hell of a task. Story came last so it may not be the best. But I'm very proud of ourselfs since we put our best effort into the project. I believe for a ludum dare game this is a huge success, I can definitely see our improvement in every aspect of game development, and this was our goal from the beginning!\"\n![221fe.png](///raw/0ea/31/z/240fd.png)\n\n\n\n### Join our Infinia Entertainment discord server to talk with us and other members.\n\n## [**Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/Jd3zBzT)\n\n[![Discord-Logo-Color.png](///raw/0ea/31/z/24a03.png)](https://discord.gg/Jd3zBzT)\n\n**Fixes:**\n\n- [1.0.1] \n  - The door to the boss room opens properly instead of halfway\n- [1.0.2] \n  - More lights are added for player to navigate easily\n- [1.0.3] \n  - Game doesnt crash anymore after player's death\n  - Enemie's size adjusted to it's complexity in a more appropriate manner\n  - Player's speed increased, enemie's decreased\n- [1.0.4]\n  - Ending scene doesn't glitch anymore\n  - Music in boss room isn't too loud, and overall sounds were balanced\n- [1.0.5]\n  - Better optimization, but still may lag on older devices, or when lots of enemies surround you\n- [1.0.6]\n  - We really wanted players to see the full game, so the overall difficulty of enemies was drastically decreased and \n    overall scene is not as dark for easier navigation, and visibility range was slightly increased!\n- [1.0.7] \n  - Dialogues are easier to understand now, Fixed an exploit where the boss could be killed from range\n- [1.0.8]\n  - Fixed a bug where after finishing a dialogue it opened again, changed color of lights in one of the rooms to green so that player subconciously knows its a safe route \n - Many people wanted harder boss so I just increased his lifes and size of bullet.\n - People really wanted particles when enemies die, so I added something simple, however, you dont have to take specifically these particles into account\n - Black-Hole was hard to see during boss fight, its now much easier to see it.\n - You can only listen to dialogue once, since its an action game and not a narrative (but story is pretty good too xD)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//76c/31/z/29d88.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/entropy","author":{"name":"CodeKoto","uid":80608,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0ea/31/z/15010.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/codekoto"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//76c/31/z/29c9a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//76c/31/z/29c9a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//76c/31/z/29e31.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//76c/31/z/29e31.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//76c/31/z/29e32.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//76c/31/z/29e32.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//76c/31/z/29e33.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//76c/31/z/29e33.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0ea/31/z/240fd.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0ea/31/z/240fd.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://hinoarashi.itch.io/entropy"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Spooky: The one who lost everything","category":"jam","description":"Spooky is a ghost who lost everything, including his life and body.

Help our forgetful friend recall how he cleared every previous dungeon floor, working backwards to jog his memory! One thing he's sure of, though... **He started each floor with no items whatsoever!**\n\n=====================================================\n\nAmnesiac Adventurer is a dungeon puzzle with a twist; start from the end, and make your way to the beginning! The only rule is that your adventurer started out the floor with no items! Think backwards in time, and try not to end up in impossible situations! Of course, you can take the easy way out... Maybe your Amnesiac Adventurer didn't open every single chest and kill every single zombie. But then... who did?\n\n=====================================================\n\nHOW TO PLAY\n- WASD to move\n- Use the Mouse to click buttons when prompted on the top left of the screen\n- Click on Retry to refresh the level and start from the end\n- You can only hold one of each type of item (helmet and sword)\n- Your goal is to make your way to the entrance of the dungeon WITHOUT any items on you (helmet or sword)\n- Interact with all possible objects to get the full score and good ending!\n\n=====================================================\n\nGah, this was a hell of a project to do... I've made games solo before, and I've worked on Unity games before, but this is my first solo Unity project! Whiiiiich is why the polish is severely lacking, and the UI sucks even more than usual. Plus, I just bought Playmaker two days before the jam started, so suffice to say I was learning how things worked the hard way. Using a brand new engine for game jams is the best way to get caught up with what you need to know, in my opinion!\n\nIf time permits, I'd love to polish up this game, maybe add a few more levels, a few more objects to interact with... Consider this a short preview of what could be! Music, sound effects, particles, maybe a mobile build, the whole shebang. In the meantime, though, enjoy the game, and don't forget to give me your opinion so I know whose game to play next!\n\nAlso, if anyone is planning on recording a playthrough, I'm mighty curious how the game would look when you play the video backwards. Hope I got the backwards logic right!\n\n=====================================================\n\nPrograms used:\n- Unity (Playmaker)\n- Magicavoxel\n\n=====================================================\n\n![Capture1.PNG](///raw/1fe/1/z/26031.png)\n![Capture2.PNG](///raw/1fe/1/z/26035.png)\n![Capture3.PNG](///raw/1fe/1/z/26037.png)\n![Capture4.PNG](///raw/1fe/1/z/2603a.png)\n![Capture5.PNG](///raw/1fe/1/z/2603b.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1fe/1/z/26033.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/amnesiac-adventurer","author":{"name":"justinooncx","uid":7921,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/justinooncx"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1fe/1/z/2602f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//1fe/1/z/2602f.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1fe/1/z/26031.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//1fe/1/z/26031.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1fe/1/z/26035.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//1fe/1/z/26035.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1fe/1/z/26037.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//1fe/1/z/26037.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1fe/1/z/2603a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//1fe/1/z/2603a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1fe/1/z/2603b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//1fe/1/z/2603b.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://justinooncx.itch.io/amnesiac-adventurer"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JxhidyeZctA5Po_9klARTXr44AmUs4yn"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WKLUpqa7xoSQPsLxo6CfF3kIfwuNmevh"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"little BEETLE bottle BATTLE","category":"jam","description":"![2019-10-07--16-05-14.png](///raw/d51/a2/z/27af5.png)\n\nInstructions:\n\nStep 1: prepare your BOTTLE for BATTLE (click and drag to swap tiles and make matches).\n\nStep 2: Recruit BEETLES for BATTLE (use the recruit menu on the left).

It's frustrating as hell it slipped through, but no new code was really added save for a minor health tweak to some enemies, and fixes an additional glitch about overflowing weapon levels. THIS ALSO fixes an issue with some seeds crashing the game, softlocks where the game won't progress past a boss, and stat typos that meant Swords, Daggers, Spears and Axes weren't obtaining the right statistics. Enjoy~\n\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nExplore an uncharted world in this bizarre hybrid of Galaga and Minesweeper! Find treasures, upgrade your equipment and try to uncover the riddle behind Calibal's Curse! Everyone's stuff is missing!\n\nCONTROLS\n\nArrow Keys - Move\nC - Swap Weapon, or randomly generate seed on title screen\nX - Search Adjacent Tiles (friendly tiles adjacent or ontop of you will show as green numbers, enemy tiles will show up as red)\n\nTry to upgrade your equipment, find the boss and fight them to progress!\n\n\n![Calibals Curse Screen 3.png](///raw/68a/1/z/28321.png)\n\nNOTES:\n\nPhew, this was a huge crunch to get this to a playable state. I BELIEVE this should run without any hitches or issues, but I definitely had to work incredibly hard and certain assets couldn't be finished properly (for example, the intro cutscene is missing music).\n\n![Calibals Curse Screen 4.png](///raw/68a/1/z/2836e.png)\n\nIt's been a LONG time since I submitted something solo for Ludum Dare. I tend to try and aim to build as complete a game package as possible. So far, this runs without any bugs, and seems like a reasonably complete game esp. considering the time limit, I'm pretty proud of this lil thing. It definitely needs a lot more polish and a lot more love, but I'd love to get people's thoughts!\n\nP.S: The dialogue is deliberately a shonky, just aiming for that \"old unknown NES game\" vibe, complete with mistranslations and weird grammar galore! \n\n![Calibals Curse Screen.png](///raw/68a/1/z/2831a.png)\n\nIf there are any crucially breaking bugs, lemme know and I'll try to get up a fix. The game runs fine to the end on GMS2 my side, so I'd like to ensure everyone can get a good go at it! Balance might be a bit buggered of course due to the nature of making a game in 72 hours. Hope you guys have fun :D.\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//68a/1/z/282ac.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/calibals-curse","author":{"name":"neonlare","uid":6790,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/neonlare"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//68a/1/z/28368.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//68a/1/z/28368.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//68a/1/z/28321.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//68a/1/z/28321.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//68a/1/z/2836e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//68a/1/z/2836e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//68a/1/z/2831a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//68a/1/z/2831a.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://studioanjin.itch.io/calibals-curse"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rMWb21DY4RTyz_B7GkZLj0STIyN1zPxv"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://studioanjin.itch.io/calibals-curse"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Start Powerless","category":"compo","description":"**Start Powerless is a platformer where you can't do anything except move left/right until you pick up the powerups in each level.**\n\n\n![LD Sc1.png](///raw/1bb/92/z/264b3.png)\n![LD Sc2.png](///raw/1bb/92/z/264b4.png)\n![LD Sc3.png](///raw/1bb/92/z/264b5.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1bb/92/z/25f56.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/start-powerless","author":{"name":"rob1221dev","uid":170929,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/rob1221dev"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1bb/92/z/264b3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//1bb/92/z/264b3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1bb/92/z/264b4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//1bb/92/z/264b4.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1bb/92/z/264b5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//1bb/92/z/264b5.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://rob1221.itch.io/start-powerless"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://rob1221.itch.io/start-powerless"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"The Thing","category":"compo","description":"Game I made where the player has to make anagrams with the word nothing to progress in the level!\nThe name of the character is Thing!

If you want, you can add/change modes (i.e. starting position, pieces order and whether it is randomised) by editing \"modes\" variable at the beginning of display.js.\n\nUpdate: ![screen-mobile.png](///raw/3f0/6/z/29933.png)\nPost-compo version was rewritten completely. It supports undos, saves, playable on mobile. Gameplay is still the same so far, except AI is slightly tweaked to play more conservatively.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//3f0/6/z/2612c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/white-starts-with-nothing","author":{"name":"Baturinsky","uid":24819,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//3f0/6/z/2985f.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/baturinsky"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//3f0/6/z/2614e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//3f0/6/z/2614e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//3f0/6/z/29933.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//3f0/6/z/29933.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://white-starts-with-nothing.netlify.com/"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/baturinsky/white-starts-with-nothing"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://wswn.netlify.com/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Ant Wars RTS","category":"compo","description":"## Start with nothing but a nest.

Produce resources,  build better types of buildings,  gain experience points, level up your town and defend it against dangerous enemies. Your goal is to build the last unlockable building: The Statue of Glory!\n\n## Manual:\n\n- Use mouse to play the game\n- The first thing you should do is building your townhall. It is the most important building in the game - the heart of your town\n- There are 3 resources: wood, stone and gold.

First and foremost, I want to say huge thanks to my friends Ruslan and Alexey here, thank you for dealing with all the shmuck I produce on a constant basis. You are awesome and I wouldn't grow nearly as far as I am now without you. \n\nThis game is simultaneously a nod to a great piece called Hammerfight (which is awesome and you should play it) and to our first ever jam entry called Ancient Contact, which was also a physics sandbox playground. You can go and check it sometime later to see how much did we manage to improve (or degrade?) over those years. It was a realy nice journey. Bumpy ride, of course, ups and downs, happiness and depression, and this fulfillment after the game is finally submitted and you can relax and enjoy it. It's what we are here for.\n\nLast, but not least, we'd want to thank all of you people, who spent your precious time playing our games, rating us, leaving feedback, and even buing our steam game. You, Ludum Darers, are absolutely fantastic bunch of people, wonderful in every way (except, maybe, picking a jam theme).\n\n*Thank you! And have a good time in rate weeks.*\n\n-----------------------------------\n\n#### CONTROLS:\n- Use mouse to fly around.\n- Hold **[LMB]** to activate your attach sockets - if there's an item nearby, it would be attached to you.\n- **[RMB]** to discard all your items.\n- **[SPACE]** to evacuate, but beware - your body will be destroyed. \n- **[ESC]** returns to menu.

start the game, and the mechanics should be very easy to get a hold of. But incase you're confused about something:\n\nCONTROLS:\n\n-Arrow keys to move.\n\n-Mouse to aim. You don't have to click, weapons are automatic.\nSpacebar to pause.\n\nMECHANICS HELP:\n\n-Kill all enemies in a room to complete it. 3 blue slabs will come out of the ground with icons on them, each representing a weapon or perk you can choose. Step on them to see a description of what they offer. Left-Click while standing on a slab to equip its weapon or perk. You may only choose 1 for each room, the other 2 will be lost.\n\n-Walk up to go to the next room.\n\nThat's the basics!\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\n*Note with download: If when you try to run the game, a window opens but then immediately disappears, try opening it in command prompt (Windows). This happens sometimes on my computer but I haven't heard of anyone else having problems with it in previous ludum dares I've done. So it shouldn't be a problem, but if it is, heres how you do it: Open command prompt, type in \"cd \" and the location of the RedVsGreen folder then type in \"java -jar RedVsGreen.jar\" and it should open.*\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//6ac/z/2639c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/red-vs-green","author":{"name":"Flying Cat of the Pepes","uid":3238,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/flying-cat-of-the-pepes"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//6ac/z/263a0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//6ac/z/263a0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//6ac/z/263a5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//6ac/z/263a5.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//6ac/z/263a9.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//6ac/z/263a9.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//6ac/z/263ca.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//6ac/z/263ca.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Document","url":"https://zoopei-white.itch.io/red-vs-green"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["java","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"FactoriNode","category":"jam","description":"Welcome to FactoriNode\n\nThis is a Factorio inspired game about connecting ingredients together in order to create larger and more advanced components.\nThe aim of this game is to grow the factory, to make more money, to grow the factory, to make more money, ad infinitum.\n\n![ezgif-4-67b1a06d8e86.gif](///raw/97e/2/z/26fc9.gif)\n\nYou can drag nodes around the space with left click and connect nodes together by dragging a red output to a corresponding blue input.\n\nOnce all the connections are set up, all the way back to the beginning resources you will see the nodes start running and the cogs spinning.\n\nUse the recipe list on the right to buy new nodes, and create \"End Products\" in order to earn more money.\n\nYou will start with nothing so your first priority should be obtaining an end product in order get some money coming in.

Your goal for each level is to construct a repeating constellation pattern that can link all the stars. \n\nThere are three main types of controls. Click on one to activate it, and then all of them use left-right mouse motion to do what they do (rotate, bend, scale). There are also switcher buttons that you can click on when they appear later on.\n\nThe game is available here: http://planktongames.com/ld45\n\nWhen thinking of starting with nothing, I went with a Big Bang theme, because before the Big Bang, there was nothing anywhere else other than the central singularity. So, each level starts with empty space, and then you explode all matter into it, and then you can play. Admittedly, the astronomy is more than a little suspect here, but the game is the point of it rather than the science, after all.\n\nGuide: \n\n- When \"Detonate\" comes up, click on the singularity to explode it.\n- When \"Constellate\" comes up, click on the controls on the bottom to link stars into patterns.\n- When \"Tesselate\" comes up, you've solved the puzzle, and all stars are reachable from your repeated pattern. (You don't need to do anything here.)\n- When \"Concentrate\" comes up, all matter in the universe is compressing into a new singularity for you to detonate. (You don't need to do anything here.)\n\nThere are 21 levels in all (you start from level zero, of course, because you start from nothing).\n\nWritten in Unity. All sound is from my face recorded and processed in GoldWave Audio. Art was made in PowerPoint and GIMP. Font is Trench by Nima Type (https://nimatype.co/), which is free and very cool.\n\n![lvl5.jpg](///raw/c66/z/26967.jpg)\n![Title.jpg](///raw/c66/z/26970.jpg)\n![lvl3.jpg](///raw/c66/z/2696d.jpg)\n![lvl1.jpg](///raw/c66/z/26972.jpg)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c66/z/2693a.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/singularity-1","author":{"name":"dob","uid":1644,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c66/z/6543.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/dob"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c66/z/26967.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c66/z/26967.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c66/z/26970.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c66/z/26970.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c66/z/2696d.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c66/z/2696d.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c66/z/26972.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c66/z/26972.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"http://planktongames.com/ld45/SingularitySourceCode.zip"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://planktongames.com/ld45"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Nepton","category":"compo","description":"Nepton is a puzzle/RTS hybrid (the RTS elements being really, really light, mind you) where you play as a divine entity conquering a world covered in water.

Gain Power by defeating enemy creatures (2 per kill) and capturing enemy land blocks (10 per block)\n- Right-click on land blocks to order ALL your creatures to go there - and attack everything they encounter.\n- The creatures have a mind of their own and once they see an enemy they'll attack without hesitation.

There’s music!\n\n### Credits\nA game by Phil Strahl a.k.a. Pixel Prophecy made in a frantic 48 hrs. My first \"real\" Unity game. Did it hurt? Yes. Yes, it did.\n\n### Downloads\nLinux and Mac builds are mildly tested, but you should be fine.

To do so, you had to do some morally questionable things. \n\nYou hope that it is all behind you...\n\n![screenshot2.png](///raw/eae/9/z/2794a.png)\n\n![screenshot3.png](///raw/eae/9/z/2794b.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//eae/9/z/276e7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/black-hat","author":{"name":"ZuhairGhias","uid":85869,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d6f/41/z/19f6d.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/zuhairghias"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//eae/9/z/2794a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//eae/9/z/2794a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//eae/9/z/2794b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//eae/9/z/2794b.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://zuhairghias.itch.io/black-hat"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://zuhairghias.itch.io/black-hat"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/ZuhairGhias/Ludum-Dare-45-Black-Hat"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Something","category":"compo","description":"## Description\nA short interactive fiction type game about nothingness.\n\n## Screenshots\n![src4.png](///raw/b6a/f1/z/26a6e.png)\n![src3.png](///raw/b6a/f1/z/26a6f.png)\n![src2.png](///raw/b6a/f1/z/26a47.png)\n![src1.png](///raw/b6a/f1/z/26a48.png)\n\n\n## Controls\nAll controls are done with the mouse.

The saloon should be defended at all costs so make sure to place your towers strategically. \n\n## Controls\n- Use left mouse button to select a tower and place it on an allowed area.\n- An active tower may be selected to view its range.\n- Use the Esc key or the right mouse to deselect a tower unit or button.\n\n## Hints\n1. Killing enemies does not provide income. You gain $ every second from your saloon and by any oil pumps you build.\n2. Careful! The enemy waves are randomly generated. Accidents may and most probably will happen.\n3. Don't underestimate the capitalist power of the oil pumps.\n4. As things get harder do not hesitate to replace your towers with stronger ones.

It will spread out the grass.\n- To plant trees, you need water. The \"Deep Root Trees\" will extract water from the ground.\n- To attack the lumberjack machines, you can use the \"Spike Tree\". But they cost you one water per month each.\n- Spike trees have not so much health. You can protect them with \"Hard Wood Trees\". The spikes can still attack, if there are other trees in front of them.\n- If you don't have water, your Spike Trees won't attack.\n- When your trees are not attacked by lumberjacks, they will heal - or even grow, if they are healthy.\n- Try to survive as long as possible.\n- To win the game, you have to destroy the cities to the left and right with your spike trees.\n- If there is no tree and no grass left, you have lost.\n\n\n*For the source file use ZIP the password \"LD45\".*\n\n*I released version 1.2 as Post-LD-Version, where I decreased the difficulty a little bit and added some tiny new features.

If you click on an empty square, it will open a menu to craft a new card **and that's where those bonuses come in handy**. \n\n- Once crafted, a card can be used in fight, and that's it /o/\n\n\n**Craft card**\n![Screenshot1.png](///raw/77f/8/z/273d0.png)\n\n**Improve cards**\n![Screenshot2.png](///raw/77f/8/z/273d4.png)\n\n**And fight!**\n![Screenshot3.png](///raw/77f/8/z/273d7.png)\n\n\n## Big Takeways\n\nIt was hard. \n\nLike, very hard. \n\nIt's very, very much a system game, with a lot of intricate elements. It's absolutely what I wanted to do though, because I usually do more narrative games, or simple puzzle games, so I underestimated the difficulty. As a result, there's a lot I couldn't do, since I just got to the point of a kinda playable state 30mn before the deadline.\n\n\n**Content**\n\nThe content is... poor. It's very frustrating, because building the system was obviously the hardest part, by far, and now that it's built, adding content is a lot easier. (Not adding bugs in the process would probably be a bit more challenging, but I hope the system is overall pretty safe.) \n\nIn a card crafting game, you'd expect to... be able to craft a lot of things, right? Well, too bad, there are only 3 different bonuses available. Would I have had two more hours, I may have been able to add maybe 1 or 2, and just that would have exponentially raised the amount of possibilities. \n\nBut well, it's 48h, no more, that's the fun /o/\n\nI still managed to multiply the variety of enemies by 9 during the last half-hour. (Ok, there are only 9 enemies, and 3 different sprites in total. DON'T BE MEAN.)\n\n\n**Polish**\n\nIt's... dry. I love polishing, doing small feedback and FX everywhere. \n\nI couldn't. I hope there still is some fun in there.\n\n\n**Sound**\n\nUh, that one hurts a lot as well. I love composing music, and doing small sounds. \n\nThere is... no sound in the game x_x\n\n\n**Visuals**\n\nIt's exceptionally poor as well, but at least there's nothing surprising about that for me. I'm a programmer. It's programmer art.\n\n\n**UI**\n\nDamn, thinking the UI for such a game was quite a challenge. I lost a lot of time just trying to figure out how to present the elements in a readable way that could be understood. I think the result is ok-ish?\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//77f/8/z/265a0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/the-card-crafter","author":{"name":"Grhyll","uid":36727,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//77f/8/z/2964e.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/grhyll"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//77f/8/z/273d0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//77f/8/z/273d0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//77f/8/z/273d4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//77f/8/z/273d4.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//77f/8/z/273d7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//77f/8/z/273d7.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://grhyll.itch.io/the-card-crafter"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/Grhyll/LD45"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Soy Sauce Man","category":"compo","description":"The soy sauce took everything.

Use your skills as a master builder to reach them and pave your way through the chasm and into freedom.\n\nPS: If you beat the final level, could you please share in the comments a screenshot of the path you built towards the goal before reaching for the stairs? I'm really curious to see how players approach it :smile: \n\n## Controls:\n\nGame should work using keyboard or gamepad devices. For the gamepad button names I'm assuming an Xbox-like controller. It should work with the equivalent buttons in other controllers, but I haven't tested any other.\n\n* Arrow keys / WASD or Left Stick / D-pad: Move Daedalus in normal mode, and move blocks in placement mode.\n* Q/E keys or Left/Right pad shoulder buttons: In placement mode, rotate blocks left/right, respectively.\n* C key or A button: Confirm placement, and Accept option in most menus.\n* X key or B button: Cancel placement. Bear in mind that this will delete the block and could leave you stuck on a level.

Circle needs a time to recharge after dot hit\n* If a dot is put into left block, it will be destroyed and bar inside the block will fill\n* Any dot that has flied through middle block and wasn't collected will also fill the left block bar\n* Bar on the left block fills and decays quickly\n\nThank you for playing and leave a comment if you figured out how to beat the game :)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9ca/31/z/25fec.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/start-with-a-click","author":{"name":"Maksim Chugunov","uid":80585,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/maksim-chugunov"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://github.com/makscee/start-with-a-click-ld45"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://maks-c.itch.io/start-with-a-click"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Stress reaction","category":"jam","description":"![statueGiflight3.gif](///raw/fa5/32/z/27719.gif)\n\nUSE HEADPHONES!\n\n![banner.jpg](///raw/fa5/32/z/276ee.jpg)\n\nThe hero wakes up in an abandoned house.

Inspired by my fear of death and wonder for how other will think of me when I am gone, I made this game to explore that a bit.  It isn't meant to be well thought out, it's just a manifestation of some of my worries and thought processes. \n\n**Disclaimer: This story is centered around loss and acceptance.  It isn't for everyone.**\n\n\n## The Background\nYou are Richard Parsons, a dead man.  You died 10 years ago at the age of 25 in a car crash at no fault of your own.  You're friend Caroline Swanson is a tech genius, verging on the edge of a mad Scientist.  She found your body, experimented day and night to finally find a way to revive you.

Feedbacks are more important than votes for us :)\n\n## How to play\nEarn every piece back one beat at a time in a scrolling chessboard. \nMove around at 120bpm with directional arrows or WASD (8 directions) - if you miss the beat the king won't move .\n\nThe black pieces will notice you when you are in check (you step on cell they menace) and will attack you in the next beat:\n![demo.gif](///raw/2e1/31/z/294a5.gif)\n\n## How to Win/lose\n\nThe purpose of the game is to reconquer all the army that is represented by the UI below the screen. You need to capture at least 8 pawns, 2 bishops, 2 knights, 2 rook and 1 queen - order is not relevant. \n\nYou lose if you get eaten by a black piece (after a check). \nYou lose if you fall behind the scrolling grid.\n\n## Devlog\n\n- **v0.2.2 - one week later** - Thanks to @Derek we added music. Added Mobile support with touchscreen buttons instead of swipe. Better Rhythm handling.\n\n- **v0.2.1 - two days later**: added mobile support with swipe to move (synchronization with visual and sound feedback needs improvement, maybe calibration? -*not implemented yet*) \n\n- **V0.2-a day later**: major bug fixes and gameplay improvements: added metronome sound and UI visual feedback of the tick. Better movement feeling. Black pieces notify now check and will move accordingly. Add win condition. Add gameover condition.\n  \n- **V0.1-submission**: time was short for us for this submission. The king moves at 120bpm with the input. Scrolling chessboard, black pieces will appear from the above row. Black piece Attack won't work :( . No win condition, no gameover condition.\nVideo of the first submission build (you can find the build it on itch.io page as well): https://twitter.com/notapixelstudio/status/1181382421595508736?s=09\n\n\n## known issues\n\n- if you don't move and the grid scrolls without a move, you don't die. \n\n\n## Credits and acknowledgements\n- Godot\n- Textreme - ui visual feedback for rhythm control is from this project!

I didn't have time to go through the codebase before the deadline to replace all the p5 vectors with simple JS xy objects so I disabled the buttons.\n\nI fixed that the day after. I consider it a bugfix, and it doesn't alter/extend gameplay. If you feel like you don't want to consider it when rating the game, that's fine, but I added it to the main build anyway since it really was made during the jam but had a bug in it, and since people might want to save their game while playing anyway (even if they don't consider it part of the submission). Hope that's fine!\n\n### 2\n\nTurned out cookies were a bad idea for this sort of save data (too big), so I changed it to the moderner local HTML5 web storage instead, or servers might get angry and break the game and prevent you from going back to it, which would be very bad indeed. It does mean old saves will be lost. Sorry about that. Again, doesn't affect gameplay or add features or anything, just a very crucial bugfix.\n\n---\n\n## Credits 👒\n\n* Ava Skoog\n\nFoley from [zapsplat.com](https://www.zapsplat.com/).\n\nFont [ARCO](https://www.dafont.com/arco.font) by Rafael Olivo.\n\n---\n\n## Controllers 🎮\n\nArrows/WASD/QZSD to move and numkeys 1234 to interact.

SAM has already programmed the moves it’s going to take to get to the POWER FLOPPY and it’ll be your job to build the level! You will start with nothing on the board, and SAM will only start it’s movement protocol once there’s nothing left to be placed on the board. \n\nYou will need to strategically plan and take care with where you place the tiles! If your placement isn't quite where you want it, simply RIGHT CLICK on any tile to remove it. SAM will execute it’s pre-programmed movement sequence even if it sends it flying off into the void of space or into a hazardous laser beam. On top of this, SAM will only pick up the POWER FLOPPY once it’s completely finished it’s movement protocol.\n\nLevels 1-1 to 1-3 are designed to teach you the basics of the game as well as what each tile can do. Levels 2-1 to 2-3 are designed to challenge you and push you to the very limits. The CHAOS level is only for those with the courage to face the unknown. This game mode randomly generates levels ranging from very easy to nightmarishly unfair! If you ever find yourself completely lost, press the Escape key to restart the map or go back to the main menu.\n\n\n![screenshot_howtoplay.png](///raw/6d4/9/z/27b69.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//6d4/9/z/28187.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/neon-overdose","author":{"name":"Don Fouts","uid":38102,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//6d4/9/z/2566a.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/don-fouts"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//6d4/9/z/27ba3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//6d4/9/z/27ba3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//6d4/9/z/27b69.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//6d4/9/z/27b69.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://inflatable-cactus.itch.io/neon-overdose"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Pandorama","category":"jam","description":"![Pandorama_Banner.png](///raw/a09/41/z/28949.png)\n\n# Hey fellas! \n\n## “Start from nothing” in Pandorama means that you must keep playing the game to find the crates that unlock:\n\n- Notifications, Sfx, UI, Weapons, Environment, Obstacles, Music, ...\n \n## Collect the crates without dying to discover all the game features!\n\n![Pandorama.gif](///raw/a09/41/z/293f8.gif)\n\n## Each time you play, the level is randomized!\n\n![Pandorama_Images.png](///raw/a09/41/z/2894d.png)\n\n## Controls:\n\n- **WASD** or **Left Joystick** to move the character\n- **Mouse** or **Right Joystick** to aim\n- **Left click** or **RB** to shoot \n- **E** or **Y** to interact\n- Pause with **ESC** or **Start** \n\n**Way better with controller! :D**\n\n## Credits:\n\n- Fernando Labarta Martín  [Rafer](https://twitter.com/RaferLabarta)\n- Diego Manzano Alonso  [Dmanzano](https://twitter.com/dmanzano101)\n- Patricio Hidalgo Sánchez  [Trisio](https://twitter.com/TrissiHidalgo)\n- Marta Zorita San Andrés  [Cauliflauer](https://twitter.com/Martazdesign)\n- Sergio Hernández-Alcelay  [Bini](https://twitter.com/VincentBini)\n\n## Updates:\n\n`08/10/2019 Minor bugs fixed & MAC version added ( works only with keyboard and mouse :( )`\n\n`09/10/2019 Fixed enemy spawner & movement input`\n\n## Thank you for playing, sharing and voting the game!\n\n## [CrazyHomeboys](https://twitter.com/CrazyHomeboys)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a09/41/z/291e0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/pandorama","author":{"name":"CrazyHomeboys","uid":84234,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/crazyhomeboys"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a09/41/z/28949.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a09/41/z/28949.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a09/41/z/293f8.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a09/41/z/293f8.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a09/41/z/2894d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a09/41/z/2894d.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://crazy-homeboys.itch.io/pandorama"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://crazy-homeboys.itch.io/pandorama"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Shape Invaders","category":"compo","description":"--Controls--\nWASD - Movement\n\nScrollwheel - Zoom in and out\n\nLeft Click - Shoot\n\nLeft Click and Hold to charge up and attack, when you hear the high pitched sound you're fully charged!

With minimum fuel you must make it as far as possible, overcoming everything the universe can throw at you.\n\n## [PLAY HERE](https://ld45.garrettallen.dev)\n\n## Gameplay\nThe game is split into multiple \"phases\".\n\n### Crash\nYou start off, having just run out of fuel, careening towards an unknown planet.  You must avoid debris and ground \nobstacles to make it safely all the way to the surface.\n\n### Explore\nOnce you reach the surface, you step outside of your ship, and must explore the landscape.  Your goal, to obtain enough fuel rods to launch your ship back into space.  You can also find other items, such as ship repair kits while exploring!\n\n### Launch\nAfter launching back into space, you pick a direction and start flying.  Be careful to not be sucked into the gravitational pull of hazards such as stars, and avoid any other untimely visitors! Keep an eye on your fuel gauge, when you run out you will float until you hit something! Use the gravity of planets to launch yourself further and maximize fuel!  \n\n### Death\nWhen you die, your journey is not forgotten!  An online leaderboard allows you to submit your jump results.  You can also view the top 10 most legendary jumps that have been completed!\n\n## Tips\n- If you are having trouble, use *_Explorer Mode_* to make the game significantly easier (Found on the main menu).  You won't be able to submit to the leaderboard, but you may be able to see more content in each run.\n\n- Planet gravity can be used to speed yourself up without wasting fuel, allowing you to travel further.\n\n- Planets with the worst atmosphere are darker and tinted green.  Planets with \"bad\" atmosphere are slightly dark and tinted red.  Planets that are bright will have the best atmosphere.  The better the atmosphere, the less O2 you use on the surface.\n\n- Smaller planets actually have smaller landscapes to explore, this can make finding fuel on them easier at times (Although less fuel is present overall on these planets).\n\n- Some planets have \"air pockets\" that are planet colored squares on the ground.  These will refill your oxygen.\n\n## Features\n- Fully procedural universe.  Every playthrough is different.  Every galaxy has a variety of planets at different distances/locations. Every planet has a variety of properties that affect things from size, air quality, gravity and more.  Every planet landscape is uniquely generated based on properties from the planet.\n\n- Tutorials!  Play new game with tutorials to see a tutorial before each phase of the game.\n\n- Aliens! After exploring so far, you may encounter alien ships.  Avoid their missiles or your ship will take damage!\n\n- Six unique planet biomes, each with their own surface and hazards.\n\n- Four unique ways to die!\n\n- An online leaderboard, compete for a position on the list of _Legendary Jumps_!\n\n- _Explorer Mode_!  Is the game too tough?  Do you want to just see what the universe has to offer?  Turning on this flag at the main menu means that you will not die from lack of oxygen, and your ship still works with no fuel!  You won't be able to submit your journey to the leaderboard though.\n\n- Adjust the music and sound effects (or turn them off!).\n\n- Quick transition mode, for skipping the interim messages (I know it can get old).\n\n## Development\n\nEverything in this game was created by me alone between Friday (10/4) 6PM and Sunday (10/6) 6PM.  Here are the tools I used!\n\n### Code\n- [Godot 3.1](https://godotengine.org/)\n\n### Art\n- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)\n- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)\n\n### Sound Effects\n- [Chiptone](http://sfbgames.com/chiptone/)\n\n### Music\n- [Bosca Ceoil](https://boscaceoil.net/)\n\n\n## Leaderboard Development\n\nThe leaderboard server was created by me using an Amazon EC2 instance.  It is being served by a NodeJS application.\n\n## Cut/Unfinished Content\nAs with every Ludum Dare, there are a handful of things I unfortunately did not get done in time!\n- An intro cinematic.  I wanted a quick scene showing the ship's dashboard flashing warning signs, then cutting to an empty fuel gauge.  This would only show at the start of a new game, to set the mood a little.\n- Aliens on planets!  I _really_ wanted this one to happen, but I wasn't even close to having enough time.  This is why you can look around with the mouse on the planets, I had plans to give you a gun to fend off creatures!\n- Better animation for the \"air pocket\" sprites.  Right now they look like little squares, hard to tell what.  I wanted them to be weird growth on the ground that spurted bubbles out that gave you oxygen.\n- Black holes.  I wanted to add blackholes that would damage you in some way, but would teleport you to a new location.\n- Asteroid fields.  The point of these was to just force the player to either use fuel to go around or attempt a flight through.  Not sure if this would have been another sequence like crashing or just obstacles in space.\n- Unique sound and music for each biome.  I thought it would be cool if each planet had its own sort of mood via music and ambient sounds.\n- Unique sky obstacles for each biome.  Really bummed this one didn't make it in, I think the space debris is okay but unique sprites for each planet would have been way cooler.\n- A thruster animation for the player's ship in space.  I put this low on priority because I thought it looked passable without it.  Never got back to it.\n- Alien ship death animation.\n- Animated tiles for relevant planets (i.e. gas planets).  This is not straight forward in Godot at the time of writing, and would have required some extra work to spawn sprites in over top of the sprite map.  I was closing in on the deadline and thought the static tiles would suffice.\n- More animations for planets such as lava planets.\n\n## Post Submission Changelog\n- Removed alien ship present on first launch (this was for debugging whoops).\n- Fixed a bug causing the \"easy\" starter planet to not be first planet after the first playthrough.\n- Fixed wording of \"sun\" to \"star\" in tutorial for launch phase.\n- Fixed a rare bug in the explore phase where world generation started out of bounds, causing a tunnel to lead out of the map.\n- Changed player starting fuel from 0% to 20% so that you only need to find one fuel cell on the starting planet to take-off.\n- Increased the spawn rate of fuel.\n- Tweaked explore phase world generation parameters, this should result in more open landscapes and less maze-like tunnel systems.\n- Fixed a bug where the player could accumulate more than max fuel.\n- Fixed a bug causing distance to not reset between runs.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//5ec/2/z/27902.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/planet-jumpers","author":{"name":"Adrenallen","uid":11493,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/adrenallen"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//5ec/2/z/28047.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//5ec/2/z/28047.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/adrenallen/ld45"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://ld45.garrettallen.dev/"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://ld45.garrettallen.dev/downloads/planet_jumpers.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Bumparound","category":"jam","description":"![bump-banner.png](///raw/c79/e/z/27f41.png)\n\nReveal the level as you go\n\n![bump_13.gif](///raw/c79/e/z/27f37.gif) ![bump_12.gif](///raw/c79/e/z/27b7e.gif)\n\nHOW TO PLAY \n\n↑↓←​→ to move\n\nX to regenerate level (useful if you get stuck)\n\nEach level starts blank.

The three tiles must be together either horizontally or vertically.\n\nMahjong Drop uses a standard mahjong tile set, without the honor tiles.  There are three suits (bamboo, wheel, and character) and each suit has a value from 1 to 9.  There are four tiles for each suit/value combination.  Once all tiles are used, a new bag of tiles is generated and shuffled and added to the queue of upcoming tiles.\n\nThere are two types of melds in Mahjong Drop.\n\nChi - Three tiles of the same suit in sequence of value, but the tiles don't have to be in order.\n- Example: bamboo 3, bamboo 4, bamboo 5\n- Example: wheel 8, wheel 6, wheel 7\n\nPon - The same three tiles together.\n- Example: character 1, character 1, character 1\n- Example: bamboo 8, bamboo 8, bamboo 8\n\nThese are the configurable options in Mahjong Drop before starting the game\n- Columns (default 10) - The number of columns on the game board\n- Rows (default 14) - The number of rows on the game board\n- Highlight meld matches - If your current piece completes a meld on the board, then the matching pieces will flash\n- Colored tiles - Uses shades of red, green and blue to differentiate the three suits.  Otherwise, all tiles will be white.\n- Preview Count - The number of upcoming tiles to display (0 through 5)\n- Show Guide - Shows a guide indicating where the tile will drop\n\nThe following objectives are tracked by the game.  Can you get them all?\n- Chi 1 - create 1 chi meld\n- Chi 5 - create 5 chi melds\n- Chi 20 - create 20 chi melds\n- Pon 1 - create 1 pon meld\n- Pon 5 - create 5 pon melds\n- Total Tiles 25 - drop 25 total tiles on the board\n- Total Tiles 100 - drop 100 total tiles on the board\n\nTools Used\n- Unity 2019.2.8f1\n- Blender 2.80\n- Gimp 2.10\n- GarageBand 10.3.2\n- iPhone for taking photo of mahjong tiles (Yellow Mountain Imports) and curtain\n- Audacity 2.3.1\n- Bfxr 1.4.1\n\n[Soundtrack](https://soundcloud.com/gatechgrad/sets/mahjong-drop)\n\nTime lapse video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVshK22kaJU\n\n\nThanks to my [supporters](https://www.patreon.com/levidsmith)\n- [Seth Robinson](https://www.rtsoft.com/)\n- [Jeremiah McCoy](http://jeremiahmccoy.com/)\n- [Mike Garcia](http://mgarcia.org/)\n- [Games Finder](http://gameslikefinder.com/)\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9a1/z/266fb.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/mahjong-drop","author":{"name":"LeviDSmith","uid":425,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9a1/z/3375e.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/levidsmith"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9a1/z/26a8f.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9a1/z/26a8f.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://levidsmith.com/games/mahjong-drop"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://gatechgrad.itch.io/mahjong-drop"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://gatechgrad.itch.io/mahjong-drop"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://gatechgrad.itch.io/mahjong-drop"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://levidsmith.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MahjongDropSource.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Blob of nothing","category":"compo","description":"*THIS IS A COMPO ENTRY*\n*All assets belong to me*\n\nhttps://zanthous.itch.io/blob-of-nothing\n\nWARNING: Turn down volume\n\n\n\nControls:\n\nWasd to move\n\nSpacebar to shoot needles\n\nRightclick parts to remove\n\nLeftclick parts to add\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGMKy-cw8m4","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//4dd/92/z/26651.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/blob-of-nothing","author":{"name":"Zanthous","uid":171476,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//4dd/92/z/2e0f4.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/zanthous"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WAbdvHwBFaVcddqKA0XmczDguvZTSi4w"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/zanthous/BlobOfNothing/tree/master"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://zanthous.itch.io/blob-of-nothing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Higher Desire","category":"jam","description":"![HigherDesire_thumbnail.jpg](///raw/bbe/e1/z/26e97.jpg)\n\nYou are one with the universe.

(Thanks Unity, a nice heart attack 30 minutes before submission). The solution was (unfortunately...) spammed GetComponent() in places where the associated fields weren't populated yet.\n- Fixed an issue where sounds would be clipping and have weird artifacts in the WebGL build. The solution was converting all WAV files from 32-bit to 16-bit.\n- Fixed an issue where enemy weapons were incorrectly scaled. A boss enemy running at you with a sword the size of a peanut and collider too big to actually hit you is amusing, but very much makes the fight zero challenge.\n- Fixed the volumes of all sound effects in the game.

On the other hand, if you're built mostly from fleshy parts, your attacks are going to be strong, but your movements slow and sluggish.\n\n![poopoo.PNG](///raw/8df/7/z/26456.png)\n\nOnce you're done creating your new body, you can test it out by going outside and trying to brawl with some enemies.

Here's some advice:\n\nIn the first 1-2 levels, don't engage in combat unless you're confident you're experienced/strong enough. Instead, wait for the big guys to brawl it out and pick up the better parts.\n\nIf you prefer being **fast**, and you accept having low strength, I'd recommend picking up **bones**.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you want to be **stronger** and don't have a problem with slower movement, the **meaty**/**robot** parts are for you!\n\nTry different balances of body parts. Maybe a robot hybrid with meaty legs suits your playstyle best! Or maybe a skeleton with a muscular body and arms? Who knows! **Experiment!**\nIf you've found a configuration you like and have some useless parts laying around, **sell them**! It's going to **increase your HP**.\n\nThat's another thing that should motivate you to pick up parts. Even if your build's perfect, you'll probably want to **heal** after the round ends.\n\nOnce you're confident in your build's ability to battle, engage in combat to **earn points** and increase your highscore! This is an arcade game, after all!\n\nHope this helps. Have fun!\n\n## The Controls can be found in the game's menu.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8df/7/z/2627e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/modumon-barebones-edition","author":{"name":"ArBe","uid":32728,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//8df/7/z/3440e.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/arbe"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8df/7/z/26438.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//8df/7/z/26438.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8df/7/z/26456.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//8df/7/z/26456.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8df/7/z/2645d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//8df/7/z/2645d.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://github.com/ArgonBeryllium/LD45"},{"label":"Other","url":"https://arbe.itch.io/ld45"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Spartan From Scratch","category":"compo","description":"\nHello and welcome to Spartan From Scratch! \n\nThere are a few issues currently where the coins don't carry between levels, the icons are not showing on the combo's and a few other nasty glitches but as far as I know the game is functional...\n\nYou will need a gamepad to play it properly.

You have limited memory with which to write your program, and the program will loop at the end, and you might have to use this to your advantage.\n\n![demo.gif](///raw/939/z/2677d.gif)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//939/z/26761.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/eeprom","author":{"name":"bentglasstube","uid":2361,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//939/z/3ff6.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/bentglasstube"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//939/z/2677d.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//939/z/2677d.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://git.sr.ht/~bentglasstube/eeprom/archive/ld45.tar.gz"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://build.eatabrick.org/eeprom/eeprom-windows-ld45.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://build.eatabrick.org/eeprom/eeprom-linux-ld45.tgz"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://build.eatabrick.org/eeprom/eeprom-osx-ld45.tgz"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://share.eatabrick.org/eeprom.html"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux","mac","web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"My Battle","category":"jam","description":"This is a game about facing down your own demons and choosing to fight every day even if it seems to be impossible.\nWASD or Arrow keys move\n\nL Jumps\nK Attacks\nDown and jump slides\nSkip the transition scenes by pressing the mouse.\n\n![running.gif](///raw/b17/z/27fb4.gif)\n![boss.gif](///raw/b17/z/27ff5.gif)\n\nMusic - @JamesOliverMusic (https://soundcloud.com/jamesolivermusicuk​)\nArt and Coding - Minibobbo","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b17/z/27fac.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/my-battle","author":{"name":"minibobbo","uid":1819,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b17/z/4a70.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/minibobbo"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b17/z/27fb4.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b17/z/27fb4.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b17/z/27ff5.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b17/z/27ff5.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://minibobbo.itch.io/my-battle"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Color and Creativity","category":"compo","description":"**Made with Unity with Text-Mesh Pro, and the Post-Processing Stack.

The true year is unknown and earth, known to the current civilization as Narkanear, is in a state of ruination. Solar bursts have devastated the once lush planet and turned the over-world into a desolate wasteland. Somewhere along the path of time a previous civilization built the Hollows across the globe to mitigate the effects of the Solar bursts. These Hollows were an attempt to try build a sustainable future for humanity by preserving renewable food sources. However, these Hollows that were once considered a bastion of hope have evolved into an inescapable danger filled with aggressively sentient food. The secrets of how they were built, and their true purpose, are lost to the current civilization and they are now only viewed as an exhaustible source of nourishment…\n\nAs a Hollow nears depletion the people who live within them split into nomadic tribes and journey out in search of a new Hollow to inhabit. Not all tribes are successful in locating a new Hollow and perish. Those who are fortunate enough to find one start with nothing and must strive to sustain their survival. These groups are led by an individual best suited to face the dangers that the Hollows present, a Foodie. The Foodie is responsible for delving into the Hollow and procuring provisions for the tribe. Should a Foodie not return, a new tribe member takes up the mantle.\n\nYour tribe has successfully located a Hollow and as the Foodie you must delve into the depths and ensure your tribes survive. Will you be able to unlock the secret while you are there…?\n\n![2.png](///raw/8c5/22/z/27b6a.png)\n\n![3.png](///raw/8c5/22/z/27b6e.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8c5/22/z/27b81.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/no-food-nomads","author":{"name":"ScalphaMission","uid":140744,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//8c5/22/z/23de1.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/scalphamission"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8c5/22/z/27b61.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//8c5/22/z/27b61.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8c5/22/z/27b6a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//8c5/22/z/27b6a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8c5/22/z/27b6e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//8c5/22/z/27b6e.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://scalphamission.itch.io/nomads"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Abstractio","category":"compo","description":"![logo.jpg](///raw/c75/z/264ad.jpg)\n\n![pic1.jpg](///raw/c75/z/264ae.jpg)\n\n![pic2.jpg](///raw/c75/z/264af.jpg)\n\n![pic3.jpg](///raw/c75/z/264b0.jpg)\n___  \n  \n💡 **Idea:**  \nWhat has no beginning and no end? One would say that's a doughnut, but to them I would reply \"You do not understand the metaphysical structure of the universe\".\n   \nTo explain the universe, we cannot really start from somewhere, as there is no beginning. Actually, there is nothing at all. No space, no void, and no time. But that begs a lot of question \"Can we really say that something exists or does not exist somewhere?\" and \"Where is that somewhere?\". To that I would reply \"Um, actually I do not like philosophy this much. Now please excuse me, I have some *objective* things to attend to\".\n  \nYour goal is to create something from nothing. Maybe that something is everything, or maybe that something is a base for everything. Use the **logic** and **atomic facts** to shape that something.\n  \n___  \n   \n✏️ **Theme:** Start with nothing\n  \n___  \n     \n  \n🏅 **Features:**\n- 2 base elements, *they will shape everything*\n- The great assembler, *this thing will consume elements to create other elements.

It is very stupid*\n- 31 craftable elements, *they are truly something you have never experienced or seen before.

You can play with your eyes closed, or maybe with your monitor upside down. Possibilities are endless, really*\n- Responsive and aesthetically pleasing game play, *there are no distractions in this game, and combined with smooth controls it is really brilliant*\n- Inspired by Doodle God, *shh-- do not tell this anyone*\n  \n___  \n   \n🎮 **Controls:**\n- Click and move mouse to drag element\n- Double click an element to duplicate it\n- Click and hold on element to destroy it\n- Double click on the assembler to show which elements can be combined\n- Escape to close the game \n  \n___  \n  \n🎥 **Timelapse:** \n  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puoMumdfBZM\n  \n___\n  \n*NOTE 1: HTML5 version of the game might have issues with audio levels and performance, as GameMaker:Studio's HTML5 export is pretty trash.*\n   \n*NOTE 2: It is actually confirmed that it is possible to beat this game on a [phone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HaselLoyance/HaselLoyance.github.io/master/0_LD45/phone.jpg), while playing in mobile browser, but you really should not attempt this as you will suffer.

Bing in 3d brought the additional challenge of creating assets (although we used a lot of freely available assets) and designing a 3D level. Our team consisted of two programmers, so asset creation was a new field for both of us.\nThe physics of the ball movement also gave us trouble. It was hard to get the right *feel* to it. With more time on hand we could have tweaked it even further.\nBecause of the nature of our game (lots of seperate objects), perfomance proved to be our biggest issue. \n\nAll these challenges combined let to a more focused approach resulting in only one level :cry:.

Choose one of four starting talents, then **beg**, work at a construction site, **sleep under the bridge**, **drug yourself**, and **become a soldier or a pilot**, but your **time is limited** -- a vast enemy force is en route to your world. A **\"narrative-driven\" RPG** with at least **four endings and even more variations** of them, an **environment that gradually changes**, and a story about facing the inevitable.\n\nMade in about 20 hours, because I believe in sleeping and had both days free for a change.

If you want to show the world your score please download one of the standalone versions.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//628/c/z/26000.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/better-than-nothing","author":{"name":"Fictions","uid":51238,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//628/c/z/2557a.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/fictions"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//628/c/z/25ffc.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//628/c/z/25ffc.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//628/c/z/25ffd.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//628/c/z/25ffd.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//628/c/z/25fff.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//628/c/z/25fff.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/Mulumage/LudumDare45"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://fictions.itch.io/better-than-nothing"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://fictions.itch.io/better-than-nothing"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://fictions.itch.io/better-than-nothing"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://fictions.itch.io/better-than-nothing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux","mac","web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"In the beginning","category":"compo","description":"> In the beginning there was nothing.\n>\n> Then came life.\n>\n> And walls.

Spin the goal machines at the correct speed to move to the next level. You only have three tools at your disposal, gears, belt drives and splitters. Figure out all the ratios perfectly and YOU WIN!\n\nWe thought of some ideas which fit the theme, but did not really feel constrained by it (something a good theme should have). The big problem is that we both (wheybags and abregado) work on a factory simulation game as our day jobs and really, really just wanted to do something mechanical. \n\n## Controls:\n- Left Mouse to select and do stuff\n- Mouse Wheel to change size of gear\n- Right mouse to cancel and delete\n- Up/Down arrows to move the camera\n\n## Hints/Stuck?:\n- If you go from a large gear to a small gear directly, the speed will increase.\n- If you go from a small gear to a large gear directly, the speed will decrease.\n- To connect a new gear directly to an existing one, use the gear tool and click on the existing one.\n- If you connect two gears with a belt, the speed will not change.\n- You cant connect gears by placing them next to each other, try using a belt instead.\n- There is NOT something missing from the third level.\n- If you don't know how something works, read the tooltips.\n\n## Development Info:\nFramework: Love2d\nLanguage: Lua\nSound Process: Logic Pro, various synth patches and processed, recorded sound from guitar and kazoo.\nOther software: Inkscape\n\n#### What worked:\n- wheybags and I work together professionally, and we used similar tools to what we use at work, so most things went very smoothly.\n- We came up with three ideas and picked the best one. The choice was obvious, because we kept talking about it for much longer than the others.\n\n#### What didn't work:\n- Getting to day 2 and realizing that we don't really understand how gears work in real life.\n- I need to brush up on my vector math (stay in school kids!) \n- Scheduling conflicts meant we had to interrupt work: plan ahead better!\n\n## Team:\n- Programming, Design: Tom Mason (wheybags) \n- Programming, Design: Ben Buckton (abregado) \n- Music: Samuel Hollywood-Summers ","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//12c/z/2786c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/geary-grinder","author":{"name":"Abregado","uid":3105,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//12c/z/312f1.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/abregado"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//12c/z/277c9.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//12c/z/277c9.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/abregado/ld45game/releases/download/gamejam_final/GearyGrinder_windows.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://github.com/abregado/ld45game/releases/download/gamejam_final/GearyGrinder_linux.zip"},{"label":"web","url":"https://github.com/abregado/ld45game"},{"label":"web","url":"https://samuelhollywoodsummers.wordpress.com/portfolio/"},{"label":"web","url":"https://github.com/wheybags"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux","web","mac"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Create!","category":"compo","description":"There is nothing…yet.\n\n*__Click__ and drag* stuff around to make stuff !

Tribes will in return provide you with offerings allowing you to create more resources. \n\n\n## How To\n\nThere will be 3 different tribes (Blue/Water, Green/Wood, Yellow/Ore) that will appear soon after you've placed their corresponding resource. Their inhabitants will wander around during the day to bring back resources to their tribe's houses, then after a hard day of labor get to bed at night.\nEach tribe is independant, meaning they require all types of resources to survive. They're also not really friendly, as in if members of two different tribes cross each other's path they will fight.\n\nThere are 3 types of resources, each of them being necessary for the tribes' survival. :\n\n**Water :** Drinking is healthy and required for a tribe's population to survive and grow.\n\n**Wood :** Wood could be considered as houses' water, being used to maintain existing houses and allowing for new houses to be build. More houses in a village will allow for an higher population limit.\n\n**'Precious' Ore :** Ore is used to make offerings to the divinity, allowing you to place more resources for them to get. Each tribe will provide you with a specific type of resource.\n\nTo place a resource, click on the corresponding resource icon then on the ground. The number of each resource you can place is indicated next to the resource's icon/button.\n\nEach tribe's survival is dependant on the others' as if one of the tribe came to disappear their corresponding resource would not be able to be generated anymore. The key is to manage an access to all three types of resources for each tribe without having them annihilating each other. \n\n## Controls\n\n#### Mouse\n\n**Interact / Place Resources :** Left Click\n\n**Cancel current interaction :** Right Click\n\n**Move Camera :** Move mouse towards screen's edges\n\n**Rotate Camera :** Hold Middle Click + Move Mouse\n\n**Zoom in / out :** Scroll\n\n#### Keyboard\n\n**Move Camera :** WASD / Arrows\n\n**Pause :** Escape\n\n## Team\n\n[Axel Born](http://axelvborn.itch.io) - Developer\n\nJordan Benureau - Artist\n\n[Masami Komuro](https://soundcloud.com/komasami/) - Composer\n\n*Made with Unity.*","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0d2/31/z/28461.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/tribal-offerings","author":{"name":"Vladadamm","uid":78544,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0d2/31/z/3423b.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/vladadamm"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0d2/31/z/28461.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0d2/31/z/28461.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://axelvborn.itch.io/tribalofferings"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://axelvborn.itch.io/tribalofferings"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Nothing to Everything","category":"compo","description":"This is a card game I made for Ludum Dare 45 Compo event.\n\nThere are mainly two different kinds of card.\n1.

You'll also need the gem\n[bundler](http://bundler.io).\n\nOnce you have those, use `bundle install` to install the gem dependencies, and\n`ruby ld45.rb` to run the game.\n\n## Known Issues:\n* \\[MAC\\] Due to the [the way MacOS handles untrusted downloads](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/app-translocation.html), this app will fail to launch by default it you try to run it from your downloads directory. You can drag it somewhere else (like the Desktop) and run it from there, launch it from the Itch app, run it from the Terminal; you just can't double-click it in Finder while it lives in the Downloads directory.\n* \\[WIN\\] You can't run the game from inside the zip file, you need to fully extract the zip first because it needs access to its data files. Either that, or you can launch it from the Itch client which handles all that for you.\n\n## Post-jam Bug Fixes\nThe current downloads from itch.io include a few bug-fixes that were done after the Jam. The issued fixed were:\n* Game crashes after the title screen on some Windows machines\n* Game crashes if you try to use the in-game menu to adjust the SFX volume\n\nNo changes to gameplay, aesthetics, etc, have been made.\n\n## Tools\nThe following tools were used to create this game:\n\n* Language: [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/)\n* GameDev Library: [Gosu](http://libgosu.org/)\n* Editor: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)\n* Graphics: [Pixen](http://pixenapp.com), [Pyxel Edit](http://pyxeledit.com), [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org)\n* Map: [Tiled](http://mapeditor.org)\n* SFX: [bfxr](http://bfxr.net) and [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org)\n\n## Credits\n  * [\"Tiny World Map\"](https://opengameart.org/content/tiny-world-map) tileset by Lanea Zimmerman and Paul Barden.\n  * [\"Tangible Darkness\"](https://freesound.org/people/keplar/sounds/130591/) music by Keplar\n  * [Alagard](http://pix3m.deviantart.com/art/Bitmap-font-Alagard-381110713) and [Romulus](http://pix3m.deviantart.com/art/Bitmap-font-Romulus-380739406) fonts by Pix3M\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ad0/3/z/27787.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/and-to-nothingness-return","author":{"name":"philomory","uid":12506,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/philomory"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ad0/3/z/27a4f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ad0/3/z/27a4f.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://philomory.itch.io/and-to-nothingness-return"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://philomory.itch.io/and-to-nothingness-return"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/philomory/ld45/archive/ld48.zip"},{"label":"Other","url":""}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Hellion: The Legend of Jeff","category":"jam","description":"https://youtu.be/RzWkQBr6cgg\n\n![image (1).jpg](///raw/0cd/72/z/29c5e.jpg)\n\nHellion, The Legend of Jeff, is a building-based, hack and slash survival game, where we follow (shocker time) Jeff as he attempts to massacre his way to wealth. Aid Jeff as he cleans up his tiny piece of hell from errant humans and self righteous Angels. Using the souls he reaps, a variety of buildings are made available to help him speed up his clean up so he might actually make it to watching his favorite soap opera tonight.\n\n![fountain.gif](///raw/0cd/72/z/28609.gif)\n\nYou can use souls to pave your way through lava, build turrets that reap soul for you even during potty breaks, pits that enlarge your storage of souls, spawners that poop out humans ripe for reaping and lures that confound these humans so much, they wouldn't see Jeff's scythe coming if it was covered in Christmas lights. Combine these buildings together, and well, it might just get as funny as Hell.\n\n![turrets.gif](///raw/0cd/72/z/28b19.gif)\n\nAlso, remember to not die. Those Angels might be pompous, but they pack quite a punch. Thankfully for Jeff, he's got the best insurance in hell, so he gets another life point for every 15 souls he gathers.\n\n![angels Fight.gif](///raw/0cd/72/z/28b18.gif)\n\nSo strap on your horns, sharpen your scythes and get down to business.

The game was developed by [Chris Mondok](https://chrismondok.github.io/), [Bill Rossi](https://github.com/bassguitarbill), and [Peter Zafonte](https://www.pzafonte.com/). Music was done by [Ryan Shello](https://www.ryanshellomusic.com/), who plays for [This Kills Me](https://thiskillsme.bandcamp.com/) and [Fuzzy Slippers](https://fuzzyslippers.bandcamp.com/). You should check them out! Graphics and artwork were done by [Miki Tharp](https://www.mikitharp.com/). You should also check out her art! Special thanks to Mary Lou Fooder who provided moral support. \n\n### Theme\nThe theme of the Ludum Dare 45 game jam is \"start with nothing\". This game incorporates that theme by having tardigrades that start with nothing and must multiply and gain technologies to win.\n\n### Gameplay / Generation 1\nThe tardigrades start out near the capsule that cracked open during the crash on the moon. Your goal is to survive by multiplying and reaching three generations and performing tasks such as building canals, growing moss, and ultimately moving a battery back to your capsule.\n\nYou begin with TEN tardigrades who can dig canals by clicking on an open ground tile. Ideally, you want to connect dug canal tiles to water sources so that the available water will flow through the canals. Keep in mind the little fellas get thirsty so they will often retreat from what they are doing to get fluids. If they don't make it back to a water tile before their fluid meter runs out, they will go into a [tun state](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150313-the-toughest-animals-on-earth). But not to worry, the time scale of this game is short enough where you can rehydrate tun state tardigrades by building canals with water underneath them. Tardigrades will also get hungry after working, and they will seek out food when they are hungry. Tardigrades that have enough moss will reproduce by clicking on a mossy rock or sometimes randomly when they are idle.\n\n#### Generation 2\nOnce you reach THIRTY TWO tardigrades you will have the ability to grow moss on rocks near water. Click a rock near water to send tardigrades to grow moss.\n\n#### Generation 3\nOnce you reach ONE HUNDRED tardigrades you will have the ability to move a battery to your capsule... and see what happens. Click the battery to send tardigrades to move the battery.\n\n### Controls\n- All actions are performed by left clicking on various tiles as described above. \n- Hover over the bar graph on the top left hand corner of the screen to see game stats.\n- Hover over the tardigrade to see its fluid level (blue circle) and moss level (organge circle).\n- You can pause the game by pressing `p` or the `pause` key on your keyboard. YOU WILL REGRET THIS!\n- Cancel building by clicking again on the space that's under construction.\n- Some actions (like reproducing) can be clicked repeatedly to enlist more tardigrades.\n- Click the button in the top right corner of the screen that says 'normal' to increase. Speeds include 'fast' and 'super-fast'. Keep clicking to toggle through the speeds.\n\n### End game\nYou win the game by moving a battery to your capsule. You lose the game by having all tardigrades in tun state. Good luck!\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//00b/e/z/27f57.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/tardigrades-on-the-moon","author":{"name":"bassguitarbill","uid":60160,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//00b/e/z/9654.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/bassguitarbill"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://whatguns.itch.io/tardigrades-on-the-moon"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/bassguitarbill/tardigrame"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Star Twit: H.

Then add thrusters to it. There are four types of thrusters: forward, backward, left-sided and right-sided. There are two important mechanics you can use to control thrusters:\n- Drag them around to change where their force is applied. This can result in acceleration and/or rotation, blah blah physics...\n- Change when they kick in and stop working. For this select a thruster and drag those orange triangular marks. Pink fuel bar will gradually decrease when the rocket is launched, indicating when a thruster is turned on and off.\n\nPlay around and learn to use these features to get the rocket where you want it!\n\n🚀 **Note:** sometimes you can accidentally click on a thruster button several time, resulting in adding multiple thrusters stacked on top of each other and totally not see it!

There you can find valuable resources: stone, wood and grass. Raw materials can be used to create traps and protective structures.

But you always can try one more time… and more… and more… It seems Death wants to play with your forever…\n\nSo don’t be surprised if something in this forest is not going according to your plan… All this – you know – flying staff, strange shadows, sky instead of ground… because death will never allow itself to be beaten!\n\n***Enjoy our spooky (and cute) Halloween monsters:***\n- Insidious pumpkins, jack-o’-lantern\n- Jumping spiders\n- Ghosts ~~seems sweet but really evil~~\n- Ancient skulls from your nightmares\n\n***Character Control:***\n- *W/A/S/D* – move\n- *Left button* – use item\n- *Mouse wheel* – switch between items\n- *E* – craft menu\n\nDeal with your Death and try to beat other players in our LD-45 game!

We did what we could to use existing sounds to create an effective atmosphere, but we have opted out of the sound category as none of the sound effects used were created during the course of the LD, just arranged and structured.\n\nLevel design was done by using a level creation tool we have created that allows us to snap geometry together.\nWe also used a base \"kit\" of some Unity extensions and tools to allow us to do proper data management and serialization. \nWe reused a settings UI generator we made for past projects, but reconstructed all prefabs to match the aesthetic of this game. The player was constructed by taking the Kinematic Player Controller plugin and writing specific movement states for this jam. All gameplay code and game elements were created for LD45. All models and materials were made during the jam as well. \n\nPost LD Additions:\n* Added a title screen and ending screen (the original version started you right in the game, and the ending was a simple \"you win\" screen). \n* Fixed a number of bugs where builds would bug out with the audio system which caused our scripts to throw exception and most people to not be able to get past the first area. \n* Changed balance on coin door counts to make not all of the coins necessary. \n* Added telemetry and metrics so that we can see how well people playing our game did. (Information such as, number of pots smashed, number of coins found, etc.).\n* Added a loading screen to properly load audio system for WebGL version. \n* Fixed a bug where a certain door did not serialize its state properly across level loads (didn't affect gameplay, but felt kind of weird to have to open the same coin door twice). \n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//18/z/27e6d.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/lost-temple-of-the-monkey-god","author":{"name":"aurel","uid":129,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//18/z/4a94.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/aurel"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//18/z/281ae.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//18/z/281ae.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//18/z/29b8f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//18/z/29b8f.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//18/z/29b92.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//18/z/29b92.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//18/z/29b93.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//18/z/29b93.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//18/z/29b8e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//18/z/29b8e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//18/z/29b8d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//18/z/29b8d.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//18/z/29b8b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//18/z/29b8b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//18/z/29b96.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//18/z/29b96.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/k3en3z70qsfd0rs/MonkeyGod.zip?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Alphabet","category":"compo","description":"Collect all the letters of (English) alphabet and don't get yourself killed by enemy *characters*.\n\n![image.png](///raw/f07/z/2678a.png)\n\nHow to play:\n* Use arrows to move around\n* Collect letters\n* Shoot by pressing the letter (on your keyboard)\n\nKnown bugs:\n* unconnected letters stay on\n* camera zooms weird\n* attaching new letters is glitchy\n\nTools used:\n* Unity3D","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f07/z/26749.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/alphabet","author":{"name":"rplnt","uid":1807,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f07/z/39a7.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/rplnt"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f07/z/2678a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f07/z/2678a.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://rplnt.itch.io/alphabet-ludumdare-45"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/rplnt/ludumdare45"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://rplnt.itch.io/alphabet-ludumdare-45"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Memory Palace","category":"jam","description":"Memory Palace: A game about (you guessed it) testing your memory.\n\nWhen I think of Start with Nothing, I think of how clueless I am whenever I start something... like this jam!

Allies also have abilities that are detailed in the game.\n![giphy (1).gif](///raw/167/82/z/28f71.gif)\n\n\nRemember to use your abilities by clicking on them. The early rounds can be dull so you can skip through them using space, but as the complexity of encounters ramps up you will need to do a lot of decision-making to come out of encounters alive. Once you get a full 6 allies the game will endlessly put you against 6 random enemies.

Collecting all of them Blue blobs, simple as that!\n\n**NOTE: Each time you click the |> button, a random level will be selected for you from the 3 available maps, or a 4th one which is completely procedural.

You can race against the clock if you wish - the countdown timer will stop once all the Blue blobs have been collected! You can then open up the Quickmenu with Escape and click the |> button to randomly select another level or use a console command if you really with to play a specific map (see Console Commands below).\n\n** The platforms are intentionally hidden. You start with nothing. They will stay visible after you stand on them. Also the blue blobs create a Sonar-like ping to reveal them. **\n\nYou will start the level in emptiness and will need to acquire your Jump (purple), Dash (green) and Double Jump (yellow) abilities to help you in your quest of Blue Powerup hoarding.

Players actually draw pictures according to assigned themes and constraints. Beginners can practice the most important part of drawing, actually drawing things, without worrying about the quality of their art, while long time hobbyists and/or professionals can practice working with specific constraints. This game is a formalized version of an exercise I used to do for fun where I would attempt to draw things in Microsoft Paint with one minute time constraints.\n\n### But I'm not an artist!\nI'm not either, but it doesn't mean you can't draw! Everyone can draw. You just need to start doing it and practicing.\n\n### But I'm an artist!\nGreat! You can practice techniques you normally wouldn't use in an environment that you're perhaps not familiar with.\n\n### What do I need to play?\nAt minimum, you just need something to draw with and something to draw on. Any style or medium works, whether it's something you're intimately familiar with or some crazy new set up you've never tried before. However, it is also recommended to have friends to play with, either in-person or online. Drawing with friends is great fun.\n\n## Post-Mortem\nThis is the first time I've ever competed in the Compo. I ended up starting very late because I was busy on the first day, and had no ideas to run off of until the night of the second day. I spent less than 24 hours making this game, but I'm very happy with the result as a whole, even if it is a very simple concept and system. This is the first time I've ever made a game that genuinely feels like something that is fun to play on a somewhat regular basis. Hopefully you can enjoy practicing drawing by playing Draft & Doodle!","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//281/31/z/265ff.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/draft-doodle","author":{"name":"DrEvilBrain","uid":78210,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//281/31/z/13c7e.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/drevilbrain"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//281/31/z/26fd4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//281/31/z/26fd4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"web","url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cLz2OZXqox0WR6XDlRZf6oT91ZZJ_R9Cbl__AaF311k/edit?usp=sharing"},{"label":"web","url":"https://drevilbrain.itch.io/draftanddoodle"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Sticky Fingers","category":"compo","description":"\n### :worried: You don't have any tickets to get prizes. \n\n### :smiling_imp: Luckily, you brought your sticky hand.\n\n#       [Play in Browser](https://ruthie.itch.io/sticky-fingers) (itch.io)\n\n![banner.jpg](///raw/a45/1/z/2698b.jpg)\n\n\n### CONTROLS\n\nSteal as much stuff as you can in 30 seconds.

You have decided to make your place in the world by winning the prestigious masters tournament. To do so you'll have to trade cards, train your skills, outwit opponents, and play smaller tournaments to work your way up.\n\nThe game consists of three primary screens:\nCharacter - Where you can allocate points for your character, your card collection, and your deck. There are descriptions of what each skill and card type does. It's important to make your deck, it is what will be used during a match.\nHub - Where you choose what tournaments to play, trade for new cards, and access the character screen. You should try to trade after each tournament. After each tournament there is also a chance you'll get a skill point to spend.\nMatch - Playing a match against an opponent.\n\n\nHow to play a match:\nMatches are divided into four phases\n\n1. Initial Choice - During this stage you choose the Card Type you'll be focusing on and your Play Sytle. The value of each Card Type is taken from your deck. The value of each Play Style is equal to the number of points you put in that skill. Click on the cards to side to choose it, click on the ones in the center to unchoose them. You can also adjust how much you want to Cheat by using the two buttons at the bottom.\n\n2. Observation - You and your opponent now do a an opposed roll against each of your Observation skills. There are three possiblities:\n   i. You win: You get a chance to reveal either the opponents Play Style, Card Type, or their Cheating value. After you've revealed something you can make adjustments to your Play Style, Card Type, and Cheating.\n  ii. Opponent wins: You don't get to do anything. Your opponent will reveal something and make adjustments.\n iii. Tie: Both you and your opponent can make adjustments. The adjustments are applied after you reveal something.\n\n3. Resolution - You and your opponent make an opposed roll. The base number of dice rolled is the sum of the values of Play Style, Card Type, and Cheat. These are rolled against a base Target of 4. Any die rolled above or equal to the Target counts as a success. The person with the most successes win. Ties are rerolled. There are also various modifiers applied before the rolls are made.\n   i. If a players Card Type has advantage against the opponents Card Type the Target of the advantaged player's roll is reduced by one.\n  ii. If the players Play Style has advantage against the opponents Play Style the Target of the advantaged player's roll is reduced by one.\n iii.

Also this my first entry in any jam what so ever. And also this was my second game in Godot.\n\n## Used tools\n\n* [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) - game engine\n* [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) - graphics\n* [Beetbox.co](https://www.beepbox.co) - music\n\n## EDIT\n\nFrom now on I will start reworking the game (I will implement a lot of new features and I will expand the game, also I would like to add modding support, but I am not comletely sure about that.)\n\nReleased [version 0.1.1](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9iujngtodctw2so/AACsMESA-KzVN1WH4kBETeoca?dl=0):\n  * fixed most of the issues\n  * added difficulty to make game more accessible\n\nOriginal version can still be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1cxbjc82dkgxnpi/AAAAU1oQYRqkbhDFjRGU86lca?dl=0)\n\n## My idea\n\nMy most idea was to create simple game (fast paced action hack and slash game with RPG elements). You are playing as mage that was imprisoned. But you wake up free in your cell, but without any knowledge of any spell and also without any mana. Your goal is to escape this prison and find a way out.\n\n## Story of creation\n\nI really underastimmated my knowledge of Godot engine and I have fallen behind really quickly. But on the other hand I learned a lot (mostly to make own font for next time so I don't have to spend hours just finding some free font - I ended up just downloading something in the end, without any metsionned licence and it looks good).\n\nThe game was made in 48 hours and all used assets were created by me and only me.\n\nTo see some of my progress you can check my gitlab (click the source code link), but sice today 14:00 CET I stopped creating devdiary into Diary.md, so you can't find all game history.\n\nP.S. I am sorry for my English (in game and especially in source code), because I am dysgraphic and I have problems even with Czech (my native language) grammar. Also I am tired so and starting to get a little bit drunk (gf brought me 3 beers - already finished those - and bottle of wine - still in progress). So I will try to fix most of the things in next few days (also will add missing entries to dev diary)\n\nP.P.S. I hope you like my game.\n\nP.P.P.S. I will try to fix most of the bugs in next few days - if you discover one please create ticket in gitlab. There will be separate link to these builds.\n\n(P\\\\.){4}S\\\\. I will try to rewrite and redo this game in few weeks and try make it public (probably free to play - also there will be other link - or watch closely my gitlab).\n\n(P\\\\.){5}S\\\\.

The button is on the lower right corner.\n- You move with the ARROWS, you accept with Z and cancel with X. Show the menu with ESC.\n- The monsters are slow and not intelligent, so you can make them go after you and then run to get the stones.\n- The monsters can't walk into the platforms. \n- After a while, the monsters get tired of following you and go back to their original place, nearby a stone.\n- When you use a stone, the monster that was close to it will freeze and can't damage you anymore.\n- The game can be a little hard, but you can try as many times as you want, you don't lose your progress.\n\n\nYou can play the game in your browser.

ALSO THERE ARE NO CHECKPOINTS BUT ITS NOT THAT LONG OF A GAME.\n\n**BUGFIX EDIT**: I can't tell you how many times I played the game as I was designing it. But while testing it after uploading it I discovered a game breaking bug that I never encountered in all of my testing. The issue was when you got to the bottom of the red section after getting the spring the player would no longer be grounded which would cause you to be unable to jump, I checked the code and saw a potential problem and removed it. After testing it again everything seemed to be working. So I continued to play to make sure there wasn't anything else. Which of course there was because the universe is out to get me. This new issue dealt with trying to go through the red door after getting the red key. This made zero sense to me as the player has a collider and a ridgidbody and the door had a collider of it's own. If I jumped while touching the door it would open. I'm not sure what the issue was so if you encounter it, try jumping at the door. The yellow and blue doors work fine and I never encountered any error with them.\n\nTL;DR: Fixed a game breaking bug dealing with the ability to jump and found another potential one that only happens some of the time. \n\n\n**BUGFIX EDIT2**: I believe I have resolved the issue with the red door not opening after you get the red key. So run little robot run!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n ** KNOWN ISSUES **\n\n1. As mentioned above sometimes the red door will not open when you have the key. Jumping at the door is a possible way to fix it.\n\n2. Speaking of the doors, there is no sound when you open them. I meant to put one in but it kept getting pushed and as you can see it was never put in. \n\n3. Sometimes when pressing down the animation for the box is slow to start but the effect still works. Not sure why this is happening.\n\n4. Because of the way the character controller is setup it is possible to jump when falling off a platform while in the air after getting the spring that enables jumping.\n\n5. While moving forward and falling off a platform after having gotten the DUCK, if you press and hold the DOWN key to turn into a box you will continue to move forward. This is especially bad if it happens when you are going for the blue key. As you will land on the bottom platforms and be shot by the turret. Thus ending your game and snatching victory from your grasp.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nAfter suffering a vicious defeat six months ago, life with Dr Lud Umdare started getting worse and you've decided that you need to leave. After months of planning your route to the portal and the items you'll need to be successful you are ready to run.\n\nFirst you'll need a SPRING so you can jump. The way to the portal will require it. There is one in the Red section of the base.\n\nNext you'll need to get a DUCK if you're going to get by the floating sentries. The DUCK is a device Dr Lud Umdare created that allows robots to turn into boxes which the floating sentries are programmed to ignore. It just so happens to look like a duck and of no coincidence there is one in the Yellow section. \n\nLastly you'll need to get a weapon installed so you can defect the creature who guards the portal room. You have a spot for the weapon already you'll just need one last piece to complete it. That piece is stored in the Blue section. \n\nEach section will also require a door key of the same color to open them. You know each section keeps its own door key but you were not able to discover where that was.\n\nBesides the floating sentries and the portal guardian you'll also have to contend with the turrets that guard the base. The are indestructible so you'll just need to avoid their shots.\n\n\n\nOnce you get the SPRING you can start jumping using the SPACE key/Joystick Fire 1.\n\nYou use the DUCK hold the DOWN arrow key/DOWN on the joystick.\n\nTo fire the weapon once you complete it press the RIGHT CONTROL button/Joystick Fire 2.\n\n** If you miss the spring you can restart by pressing R to restart the level. **\n\n\nYou are little robot and this is your story...\n\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d2/z/26661.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/little-robot-run","author":{"name":"KunoNoOni","uid":45,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d2/z/f26e.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/kunonooni"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://github.com/KunoNoOni/LittleRobotRun"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://kunonooni.itch.io/little-robot-run"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Escape the Minotaur","category":"jam","description":"​This game is a Ludum Dare 45 Submission.

This was the way we  could upload a 'finisheable' game on time.\n\nV.5 (Post Jam)\n- After the deadline, we fixed the 'player not sticking to moving cubes' bug (we creted a Unity development build and found there was an \"NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\" error) and activated the last 2 scenes.\n- We also reactivated the UI tutorial and player rotation.\n- And we fixed that you could go back to the begging of the level if you pressed R as suggested by @afestivedolphin in the comments.\n\nTell us what you think about the game in the comments!\n\nThanks for playing ^^","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f26/a2/z/287ec.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/nothing-to-grab-onto","author":{"name":"JaumeMontagut","uid":167099,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/jaumemontagut"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f26/a2/z/28e33.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f26/a2/z/28e33.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f26/a2/z/291df.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f26/a2/z/291df.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f26/a2/z/28e35.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f26/a2/z/28e35.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://wadoren.itch.io/nothing-to-grab-onto"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://jaumemontagut.itch.io/nothing-to-grab-onto"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Blank Page Syndrome","category":"compo","description":"Going meta with the theme and the fact that I struggled to find any idea that suits me : so I went with the blank page syndrome.

If the dragon rage reaches 100% it's game over.\n- If a mole gives the wrong treasure the dragon gets angry, otherwise you get gold coins.\n- Kill unwanted moles with left-click.\n- You start with a cap on your max treasure size, you have to buy and build mines to increase\nthe cap up to 1,000,000 before you can win!\n- When you kill a mole the other moles panic and walk faster, their panic decays slowly when they are not\nbeing killed.\n\nGood luck!\n\n## Description\n\nThis Dragon has no treasure hoard! \n\nMole minions are running to bring him some of their treasure, but sometimes they bring him trash! Not to mention this dragon is picky, so he only wants particular treasures.\n\nWhen the moles bring trash or treasure the dragon doesn't want, left click to fireball them! Dragon only wants what it wants. Whenever bad treasure or trash is given to the Dragon, he will become more and more enraged. If Dragon's rage reaches max level, it's game over!\n\nThe goal is to fill up the Dragon's treasure trove. Get 1,000,000 worth of treasure to win the game.\n\nDragon can build up another mole mine by paying 50,000 gold. Click the build button and place them anywhere on the map using left click. Mole mines increase the rate of treasures brought to the Dragon and also the treasure trove's cap! Dragon can also target and destroy mines.\n\nBut be careful. If you fireball too many mole minions, their panic will increase and they will run faster to you, bringing both trash and treasure! \n\nFeel like cheating?\nPress 'G' to get 10,000 gold instantly!\n\nGameplay Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4urBC3i63UU\n\n![Screen-03.png](///raw/9f2/z/288ab.png)\n![Screen-02.png](///raw/9f2/z/288ad.png)\n![Screen-01.png](///raw/9f2/z/288ae.png)\n\nCode: @cyberstarlight & @karim1209\nAudio: @cephalo\nArt: @falu\n\n**Check out the music here: [Draconomics OST](https://soundcloud.com/cephalojams/sets/draconomics-ld45) **","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9f2/z/2889c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/draconomics","author":{"name":"CyberStarLight","uid":761,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9f2/z/4108.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/cyberstarlight"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9f2/z/27e6f.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9f2/z/27e6f.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9f2/z/2888e.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9f2/z/2888e.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9f2/z/288ab.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9f2/z/288ab.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9f2/z/288ad.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9f2/z/288ad.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9f2/z/288ae.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9f2/z/288ae.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://cyberstarlight.itch.io/draconomics"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zH_n689ktj8q7tVtPq-_-gVqHj_2sXWb"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fgm1G4Zj2q12qsGRHPpz0HkgXhAl01Wt"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Begging Simulator 2019","category":"compo","description":"![ss2.png](///raw/8ae/z/26707.png)\n\nTry to survive in the harsh Urban landscape.\n\nControls:\n Move with arrow keys\n interact with X\n Sprint/leave shop with Z\n Escape to Exit game\n\nGame is mostly still in a prototype stage and lacks a lot of content and features.\n\nThanks for checking out my game!","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8ae/z/2666c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/begging-simulator-2019","author":{"name":"lekiy","uid":3752,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//8ae/z/a1e3.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/lekiy"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8ae/z/26707.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//8ae/z/26707.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/3vfvanl7jtammme/Ludum%20Dare%2045%20-%20Start%20With%20Nothing.zip?dl=0"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/ccr9ebku1ohj2jz/Ludum%20Dare%2045%20-%20Start%20With%20Nothing.yyz?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Letterout","category":"jam","description":"In Letterout, you use the letter tiles that you draw to form words and move around the level.

It's up to you to find out what based on the reactions you get and use that to increase your clout.\n- Build Sneets by collecting **templates** and **words** to put into the templates, whether using ones you get for free in the mail, or using ones you steal from other peoples' Sneets.\n- **Attack** determines how much clout you get, **Defense** determines how much damage you take when you make a bad Sneet, and **HP** determines how much HP you start with.\n\nIf you want your Twitter/Discord name to be in our game you can send it to us [here](https://forms.gle/KfSZrJGzQXXFKHT47) and we'll add you after Ludum Dare is over!!\n\n\n#### Credits:\n\nProgramming by \n- rob fichman https://twitter.com/bobacupcake\n\nArt and writing by\n- adam https://twitter.com/adam_s_j \n- ago https://twitter.com/agostaini\n- andrea 'play kid icarus uprising' colorsplash https://twitter.com/ruddyroad\n- andrew  https://twitter.com/legsrjust4show \n- carmela \"g'raha tia final fantasy 14 lover\" dansen https://twitter.com/carmeladansen \n- goldy https://twitter.com/sarazarann \n- lillie (our dog) \n- elly https://twitter.com/banananaki \n- dylan https://twitter.com/dylanrexed \n- james https://twitter.com/GusherGauntlet \n- peepo https://twitter.com/beeebobebo\n- rob fichman https://twitter.com/bobacupcake \n- static https://twitter.com/staticcolour \n\nFonts are from Chevy Ray's Pixel fonts!\n\nand a big thank you to everyone who donated their display names to us!!\n\n#### Known issues:\n- If you die the UI freezes up and you can't click anything.

You can catch\nit by using the **Catch** buttons.\n\nIf you manage to grab a sword, you can attack enemies by pressing\nthe **Left** or **Right** buttons.\n\nA laser rifle will be your best friend, but you'll have to be\nquick in dropping the sword and grabbing after. The *Drop* button will allow\nyou to drop your current weapon. Use the **Left** or **Right**\nbuttons to aim, and press the **Fire** button to shoot.\n\nIf you manage to stay on the rope for 5 minutes, you pass the gauntlet.\nHowever, the enemy onslaught increases the less time you have left, and\nthe better the weaponry in your possession.\n\n**FINAL WORD**\n\n\nEnjoy the game, and if you have any comments or feedback, please let me know.\n\n\n**TOOLS USED**\n\n**Game engine**\n\nGamemaker Studio 1.4\n\n**Art**\n\nAseprite\n\n**Audio**\n\nsfxr\n\nAudacity","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cc2/72/z/296c2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/tightrope-gauntlet","author":{"name":"Jonno","uid":160460,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cc2/72/z/2a6ba.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/jonno"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/kzwy05rgma9w9iz/Tightrope%20Gauntlet.gmz?dl=0"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/h63zsbgjecfpyhf/Tightrope%20Gauntlet%20LD45JamFinal.zip?dl=0"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://jonnobones.itch.io/tightrope-gauntlet"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"a new beginning","category":"compo","description":"In this game you must help the protagonist escape a prison and start his new life.

Scholars believe this piece of video-game may hold the key to unlocking our understanding of metaphysics!\n\nYou must renounce the desire for preconceived notions and bask in the immediacy of improvisation. It is not only a a profoundly comedic affair, but also simultaneously a thought-provoking commentary, a microcosm of society, an harrowing tragedy and a peaceful passing of time.\n\nThe unique beauty of absurdity is in its ability to seamlessly blend every emotion in the spectrum, far removed from the dignity of rationality.\n\n\n## Controls\n\n- WASD / Arrow: Walk\n- Z: Interact / Confirm\n- Mouse: Menuing features (except for one which is keyboard only)\n\n## Enjoy!\n\nThe game is still very janky, but it's part of the charm!\n\n---\n## BEFORE CASTING VOTES\n\nThe game was NOT finished on Monday. Most of the main features were completed on Sunday, but missed the narrative element and story telling progression which mixes all the features together. The scope of the project was a little ambitious as you will see, and even an all-nighter wasn't enough to finish in time. I still posted in \"Jam\" because I think it wouldn't get much exposure in \"Unfinished\" and it would hurt to have such a passion project lost in the dark.\n\nHowever keep in mind this is still a **post-jam** version only, finished 4 days later. I don't know if it's right for us to take votes, it'll be up to you to decide. 'Graphics', 'Audio' and possibly 'Humor' to some extent were fair and representative of the game on Monday when the jam ended, but the rest of the categories were absolutely not, especially for 'fun'.\n\nIf you feel like this is unfair to other games then stick to words. To us, comments are worth a thousand time more than scores. Ultimately we designed this game to make people feel happy, not to measure ourselves!","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8d4/z/295e1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/cowquest","author":{"name":"oxysoft","uid":1240,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//8d4/z/4c39.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/oxysoft"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8d4/z/295df.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//8d4/z/295df.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://oxysofts.itch.io/cowquest"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Village Simulation Game","category":"jam","description":"A simulation game about building up a village from nothing.\n\nThis game is played with the mouse.

Exit is on tob of the empty room (so you strat with nothing, right?). Find more boxes to reach the ladder. Easy, right? Nope, there are bugs (literally and figuratively).\n\n### Controls\n\n| Button  | Action |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| **Lef arrow** or **A**  | Move left  |\n| **Right arrow** or **D**  | Move right  |\n| **Up arrow** or **W**  | Jump (you can also double jump)  |\n| **Spacebar** or **Tab**  | Attack  |\n| **E** or **Shift**  | Pick/drop a box  |\n\n### Changelog\n\n**07.10.2019**\n\nFixed an issue with weird behaviour of the boxes. It is not perfect, but these should act more properly now. No more sky jumping.\n\nRemoved one box from the starting room. Even after fixing physics issues the game was not chalenging and could be finished easly (it still can be, to be honest, but not THAT easy). \n\n### Known issues\n\n~~Well, boxes can behave weird. There is something wrong with physics, for sure. I'll try to fix that. Tip: I'd avoid trying to pick a box if a character is \"touching\" two of them.~~ Fixed. I mean almost fixed. Well, it should be better now. At least I hope.\n\nIf you come really really really close to a box with another box in hands, they will switch places. But no more picking up a box you standing on!\n\nCorpses of enemies doesn't fall. Damn bugs! They disapppear though, nice of them.\n\n\n### Unknown issues\n\nI suppose there is more than known issues. They're still unknown though.\n\n### Credits\n\n| User  | Credits |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| @foka  | Programming, graphics, almost everything  |\n| @aart  | Absolutely nothing  |\n| @sarneh| Absolutely nothing  |\n\n\n### Music\n\n* By: [TeknoAXE](http://teknoaxe.com/Home.php)\n* Title: [Synthwave E](http://teknoaxe.com/Link_Code_3.php?q=1534)\n* [License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//456/c/z/2643a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/my-friends-abandoned-me","author":{"name":"SaRNEh","uid":50770,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//256/c/z/19aa8.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/sarneh"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//456/c/z/2643a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//456/c/z/2643a.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://machinode.itch.io/my-friends-abandoned-me"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Scope Creep","category":"compo","description":"Souls-like platformer.\n\nBeat the game? \nNow do it without power-ups!\n\nYou start with nothing and that's all you need to beat it.\n\nThe name is inspired after what happened to me during this compo, having to bin the project a couple of times.\n\nHope you'll enjoy the game.\n\nYou: ![player.png](///raw/c97/9/z/25f9d.png)\n\nYour death: ![powerUp_Dead.png](///raw/c97/9/z/25f9e.png)\n\nWhat caused it: ![spikes.png](///raw/c97/9/z/25f9f.png)\n\nWhat it should have been there: ![walls.png](///raw/c97/9/z/25fa1.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c97/9/z/25f93.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/scope-creep","author":{"name":"2Demigods","uid":38812,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/2demigods"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c97/9/z/25f9d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c97/9/z/25f9d.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c97/9/z/25f9e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c97/9/z/25f9e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c97/9/z/25f9f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c97/9/z/25f9f.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c97/9/z/25fa1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c97/9/z/25fa1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://vlad-z.itch.io/scope-creep"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://vlad-z.itch.io/scope-creep"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://vlad-z.itch.io/scope-creep"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://vlad-z.itch.io/scope-creep"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://vlad-z.itch.io/scope-creep"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"SYNTHMAN","category":"jam","description":"![SYNTHMANLOGO.png](///raw/dab/82/z/283bf.png)\n\nHave you ever been trapped in a abandoned subway station?

This new version only fixes a few fairly large bugs listed in the changelog below and does not add any new content to the game. The fixing of these issues after the competition deadline goes with the rules of the competition, however, if you take issue with this I have left up the original files marked (OLD) so you can play the game as it was if you should desire. Thanks for your understanding.\n\nChangelog:\n- Stopped story dialogue from appearing every level.\n- Stopped player starting with a gun on the second go at tutorial.\n- Menu settings carry over between runs.\n- Fixed gun layer issues causing an invisible gun.\n- Stopped tutorial stats from carrying over to start of a new run.\n- Balanced painfully loud audio.\n- Fixed shooting issue causing the player to float.\n- Changed tutorial colliders to stop the player from being stuck at times.\n\n## The Game\nThe Only Way is Down is an action, roguelike game set in the dangerous depths of Mars' expansive underground caverns. As an architect hired by Mars Mining Co. it's your job to figure out the mystery that has been plaguing the mines. After a strange occurrence at work, you are left without your stuff and trapped underground. Traverse through complex and winding cave systems, fighting off enemies and collecting items and upgrades to delve deeper underground. What lies at the centre of the planet? There is only one way to find out...\n\nOur 6th entry into Ludum Dare and once again potentially a bit over-ambitious. The theme immediately made us think of roguelike games like the binding of Isaac and how you start with nothing but the base weapons and have to collect items and upgrades throughout the game, and we thought it would be great fun to try and make one of our own drawing influences from both games. Of all Ludum Dare games we have created, we believe this has the most promise for further development as roguelike games lend themselves well to more content being added to increase playability. Feedback is greatly appreciated both on bugs that need to be fixed and things you would like to see added wether items, enemies or other. Follow us on twitter if you want to keep posted about a post-jam version with features we didn't have time to implement within the competition hours.\n\nThe tutorial and story in the game can be disabled in the settings menu on the main menu if you want to start a quick run, however, if you have never played before I recommend keeping both enabled!\n\n## How to play\nThere is an ingame tutorial which is the best way to learn how to play, however here is a brief overview of the controls:\n- 'A' and 'D' to move left and right.\n- 'W' to jump.\n- Hold 'Shift' to sprint.\n- Hold or click 'Left Mouse Button' to shoot.\n- Press 'F' to drop dynamite.\n\n## Notice\nPlease don't spoil the game for others, there is a special surprise for those good enough to make it through all 3 areas and complete it!\n\n## Screenshots\nAll screenshots are taken from the first area and item room only to not spoil too much of the game!\n\n![1.png](///raw/318/5/z/28204.png)\n![5.png](///raw/318/5/z/28281.png)\n![4.png](///raw/318/5/z/28200.png)\n![2.png](///raw/318/5/z/281fe.png)\n![3.png](///raw/318/5/z/281f3.png)\n\n## Credit\n- RokaJosh: Programming & Art\n- Thomu: Art & Music\n\n## Links\n- Our Company Website: http://www.jagtekgames.co.uk/\n- Our Company Twitter: https://twitter.com/JaGTeK_Games\n- RokaJosh Twitter: https://twitter.com/RokaJosh\n- Thomu Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/thomuofficial\n\n## Tools\n- Unity 2019.1.12f1\n- Photoshop CC\n- Piskel\n- Ableton 9.5\n\n## Future Development\nIf you are interested in the further development of the game, then feel free to subscribe to the devlog here: https://theonlywayisdowndevlog.wordpress.com/","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//318/5/z/282f3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/the-only-way-is-down","author":{"name":"Roka Josh","uid":22547,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//318/5/z/6ef1.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/roka-josh"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//318/5/z/28376.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//318/5/z/28376.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//318/5/z/28204.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//318/5/z/28204.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//318/5/z/28281.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//318/5/z/28281.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//318/5/z/28200.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//318/5/z/28200.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//318/5/z/281fe.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//318/5/z/281fe.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//318/5/z/281f3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//318/5/z/281f3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://jagtek-games.itch.io/the-only-way-is-down"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://jagtek-games.itch.io/the-only-way-is-down"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://jagtek-games.itch.io/the-only-way-is-down"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux","mac"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Alcindor the Alchemist","category":"compo","description":"**Story:**\n![alcindorcoverimage.jpg](///raw/ab7/z/26518.jpg)\n\nOne day when Alcindor was experimenting with creating something from nothing he got it all terribly wrong and instead transported himself to the middle of nowhere.

The gods have decided to use you in their arena, where the souls of other men and creatures also lay trapped, unable to pass on to the afterlife.\nYou will have to compete with the others in the arena. If you die, the gods will bring you back to continue competing; a cycle of endless torment. If you win, and perhaps please the gods with your battle prowess in the arena, you might just earn a second chance at life...\n\nWhen the game starts, you have the opportunity to select a weapon. Each weapon has different stats, like damage, range, and cooldown. Once you choose a weapon, your choice is final until you die again. After each victory, you'll be able to allocate some skill points - these persist after death, so if you're having trouble beating a certain enemy, keep fighting and leveling up.\n\nThough starting with the right weapon will help you overcome certain enemies, sometimes the only way to win is to start with nothing...\n\n## Controls\n\n**WASD** - movement\n\n**J** - **Dash** - Increase your speed.

The GDs lost an enormous amount of time to make complexes level design in papers cut and glued in a false cardboard (witch were all cut from a cereals box, the respect his gone, so far away), reminding themselves that Visio existed, 1 day before the deadline. \n\n![Capture.PNG](///raw/ab6/82/z/27441.png)\n![image0.jpg](///raw/ab6/82/z/274a8.jpg)\n\nThe professionalism at his highest. \n\nThe programmer, named Hugo, but I prefer to refer at him has “the guy who save the Jam” cause of his scripting talent, found amusing to ask the GAs to create that much model sheets and modular backgrounds/decorative elements (long live to the retro 8-bit). I didn’t count the number of failures and restarts, but watching the faces of the GDs bashed by some difficulties relaxes me.\n\nIt was our first time making an 8-bit game and create animation props, a rough experience but enjoyable. Ours Artistic Headmistress (Éline) fell in depression many times, for obscures reasons. Some artists felt sick (or had to, like, sleep. Obviously overrated) and were forced to quit the ship before the deadline. \n\nWe’ll never forget them. \n\nI’m the only survivor, surrounded by strangers, making unspeakable noises, searching for problems that doesn’t even exist, patting keyboards like robots for their monstrous god: Unity.\nIt's actually during one of these moments of craziness that I took the time to wright those magnificent words just for you, who got through this (particularly longer than needed) text filled with ... nothingness, just a French humor touch. \n\nWhatever if the game correctly launches, we would improve it.\nIf the game can’t be played at his launch, we will take revenge and slaughter the GDs, because I don’t know what to do with this kind of situation... \nWhatever is the finalized result, the simple fact to see the beginning of a game which comes directly from our under slept brains, always gives us the same feeling : “I want to see more, when do we continue?” \n\nMay our game amused you, and yours be accomplished\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ab6/82/z/273ee.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/echo","author":{"name":"GameSup 1st year promo","uid":165562,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/gamesup-1st-year-promo"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ab6/82/z/273de.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ab6/82/z/273de.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ab6/82/z/27934.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ab6/82/z/27934.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ab6/82/z/27adf.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ab6/82/z/27adf.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ab6/82/z/27ae0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ab6/82/z/27ae0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ab6/82/z/27ae8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ab6/82/z/27ae8.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ab6/82/z/27af0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ab6/82/z/27af0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ab6/82/z/27b04.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ab6/82/z/27b04.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ab6/82/z/27afa.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ab6/82/z/27afa.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ab6/82/z/27b07.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ab6/82/z/27b07.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ab6/82/z/27441.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ab6/82/z/27441.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ab6/82/z/274a8.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ab6/82/z/274a8.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uBgkwpc8VQv7QBm08yZ7B5z9SC-N2-bl"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","vr"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Chasing Light","category":"jam","description":"![Image.JPG](///raw/57a/92/z/270fd.jpg)\n\nSurvive as long as you can in the darkness.

And here is the result after precisely 22h of work and watching tutorials.\n\nIt was really fun to create a whole project cycle solo. Even those few sounds I added created using an audio recorder. xD\n\nActually I have started creating the game with visual code, but feeling not comfortable enough with it, I moved to common scripts in the middle of the jam.\n\nAs a result I have not much of gameplay. Even this katana feature was implemented to support the theme at least in some way.\nBut I am not a code guy totally, so even so this result is a small personal achievement for me.\n\nI had a learning goal, and I achieved it. So I am proud of it. :3\n\n**[Here I will add some tutorial links I used during the jam soon]**\n\n**P.s.** To be very honest, before updating LD page I fixed a crystal feature (noticed it is not adding speed in the morning) and added death animation on character (same as on monster). I took me 15 minutes out of the jam.\n\nOh, just noticed I accidentally added a death animation on katana grab with this fix. Mm, ok. Let it be. xD\n\n## Genre:\n\n**Top-down action RPG**.\n\n\n## Description:\n\nGrab your katana and slash monsters.\n\nGet crystals to raise your speed.\n\nStruggle to have a high score.\n\nAnd relaunch the game to restart because I did not have time to add the restart feature. xD\n\n## Controls:\n\n**W,A,S,D / Arrows** - **Movement**\n\n**Aim attack with mouse**\n\n**Left Mouse Button** - **Attack**","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//920/8/z/26f4b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/grab-your-katana","author":{"name":"Mikeliosus","uid":32809,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//920/8/z/49f0.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/mikeliosus"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//920/8/z/29833.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//920/8/z/29833.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vMXkA_Xzo_vxU1y6p4uMRQWvYCzDwmiI"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1urEHyjf-fh9T04qjjQHv75NAoW4aykhH"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Hermitage","category":"compo","description":"*Alone in the woods lived a happy hermit who had nothing and wanted for nothing...*\n\n![Hermitage.png](///raw/b42/82/z/26781.png)\n\n- Arrow keys to move\n- X to interact\n- F12 to toggle fullscreen\n- Esc to exit abruptly and without warning\n\n\nThis was my first attempt at Ludum Dare!\n\nThe game is written in C# with the [FNA](https://fna-xna.github.io/) framework.

We HIGHLY SUGGEST playing the new galaxy edition, but understand that its additions should not be judged for rating purposes. The original upload will still be available to play and rate below.\n\nInspired by the entire history of mankind, Big Brain Boy: An Intellectual Odyssey (abrv. BBB) chronicles the collective cognitive evolution of our species, exploring how our attention turned from what lies beneath our feet to what lies beyond the stars. You begin as Doug, a humble man who quite literally knows nothing, and share in his elation as he discovers sight, smell and speech for the very first time. No game before has so viscerally and accurately captured the magic of learning.\n\nIn BBB, curiosity is your guide, as you explore you surroundings and activate segments of your mind through pulse-pounding bullet hell gameplay. As Doug's intelligence grows, so does his confidence, leading him on an earnest crusade to become the savior of humanity.

You actually start with almost nothing. Collect more graphics cards to get sharper textures, better music and more objects rendered at once.  \nTell us in the comments what level you managed to reach :slight_smile: \n\nPlay with resolution ratio 16:9!!!\n\n**Warning** The Web version runs a bit slowly so we strongly recommend using a standalone executable for your system (if it's not there yet, we'll add it later).\n\n\nWhen you start playing a game, you expect some basic things. To name a few, you at least want to have graphics and audio. 28Ti features puzzle-platformer gameplay that allows you to improve graphics and sound of the game as you progress through the levels.  \nThe game revolves around existing objects that are not rendered until you have sufficient amount of graphics cards collected. As well as revealing more and more of the level contents to your eye, those cards also improve the quality of all textures and even affect the quality of the music.  \n28Ti is a level based puzzle-platformer game, which in our interpretation means that you need to solve problems, relying on your skills with the controls as well as how to use them in certain situations. Your memory is also important, as quite frequently you will be facing invisible (not rendered) obstacles in order to get to the next card. However, at the end of the level, when the exit portal appears, nothing on the level is hidden from you, so you can see the justifications of your (most likely) numerous deaths.   \nThe game starts easy and over the course of three manually created levels builds up to rather extreme scales of difficulty. For the most determined people, after the ending titles there will be a bonus level, so don't \"Alt+F4\" when you reach that moment if you wish to challenge yourself!  \nEven if you ragequit mid-game and decide not to continue, let us know what you think of it (we expect much flaming towards our level designer anyway :slight_smile: ).   \n\n**!The game does not have saves or a level selector, so don't close it if you wish to continue from where you left it!**  \n\n_// All textures, animation and visual effects as well as the music pieces were created by the team from scratch.

Even your friends and family have forsaken you because they were disapproving of you doing making video games for a living in the first place (\"too risky\" they said).\n\nAs you're looking for a nice bridge to sleep under, an unknown man approaches and makes an offer to you : he loans money to you so that you can live on, and you must engage in Underground Robot Fight in exchange (a business of his) until you pay it back.\n\nYou decide to take his offer. Will you succeed in paying your loan back ? Will you let your debt swallow you whole ? Or will you awaken to the Underground Robot Fight Beauty, and become the uncontested boss of the arena ?\n\n## How to play (or at least how it was meant to be played)\n\nThe game has two phases, a preparation phase and a fighting phase.\n\nYou win when you manage to pay back your loan.\n\nTo earn money, you can have your robot fight every night. The stronger the foe, the greater the reward.\n\nEither you win or lose, if your robot is damaged, it is repaired the following day. This is not magic, this is engineering. (you can at least handle this much after studying this for 5 years I hope)\n\nYou pay interests everyday as long as you have ongoing loans. Generally, the higher the loans, the higher the interests amount.\n\nYou can spend your remaining fund on robot upgrade to win over tougher opponents, and earn more money.\n\nYou lose if you go bankrupt.\n\n### Fights explained\n\n![1570479622105.png](///raw/f03/92/z/27966.png)\n\nThis is a one on one robot fight with a turn-based combat system. Your robot is always on the left hand side.\n\nYou can choose one of 3 attack types :\n\n- Attack : Your robot performs a physical attack, effective against Projectile\n- Guard : Your robot attempts to parry and counter incoming attack, effective against Attack\n- Projectile : Your robot performs a ranged attack, effective against Guard\n\nBoth robot strike at the same time when you press either of three attack button.\n\nYou win if your oponent's health reaches 0.\n\nYou lose if your robot's health reaches 0. \n\n**PRO TIPS**\n\n1. enemy attacks are not random. Each enemy generally have a preference for a certain attack type. Stay alert ! (we all have our favorite attack in such games don't we ?)\n2. Each attack type deals more damage when your opponent perform a certain other attack type. be sure to check health bars when blows are exchanged.\n3. On the right side of the screen, an attack type icon is displayed next to a percentage range. This is the probability for your oponent to perform an attack of the shown type (SKL on the screenshot above). The range will get more precise as your OBS stat increases.\n\n### Preparation phase\n\nDuring this phase, you can\n\n- pay back your loan (and win if you pay back everything)\n- upgrade your robot or your character\n\n#### Money\n\n![1570479032178.png](///raw/f03/92/z/2796b.png)\n\nIn this panel, you can check how much you have left to pay, and info about each of the loans you have taken.\n\nYes, you are already broke AND indebted with one loan, and you can borrow more money if you need.\n\nThe fights will get tougher as you days pass so you'll probably need to resort to this to overcome stronger enemies. Be careful though as your daily payments will increase too. Don't go bankrupt!\n\n#### Robot upgrades\n\n![1570479063703.png](///raw/f03/92/z/2796d.png)\n\nHere, you can buy upgrades to make your robot stronger.\n\nDMG increases the damage dealt by all three attack types. DEF decreases the damage you take. SKL makes effective attack types even stronger and reduces the damage taken when your opponent hits you with an effective attack. There are also special upgrade you can unlock later which effects are described on the Interface.\n\nOh, and you can also check out your robot's stats on the right side!\n\n#### Character upgrades\n\n![1570479202708.png](///raw/f03/92/z/2796e.png)\n\nBuy assets for yourself!\n\nThere's only one upgrade on this screenshot but there might be more when the game is actually released.\n\nOBS stands for Observation and increases your odds to see through your oponent's next move during a fight!\n\nClick the \"you\" tab to check your character's stats.\n\n**PRO TIPS**\n\nYour reputation will have an effect on the loans you can take.

And to really hammer the point of starting with nothing home, I decided that player character will start with absolutelu nothing - not even a loincloth.\n\nThough I made kind of a censuring system so you are not forced to see something you might find offensive. It is on by default, but you can turn it off in Options menu. But remember - you have to hold \"Control\" while you disable it.

I wrote the dialogue but there wasn't enough time to implement all of the little things I wanted to do, like admonish you for too many beds, check the upstairs and downstairs. Everything had a point value it was worth, but I abandoned that eventually.

While the team has grown, we feel that we have a good combination of talent going.\n\n## Description\n\nInfinite Prospector is a game about a lowly prospector who finds himself at a hole in the ground with nothing to his name. He must begin prospecting the area for minerals and gems of ever increasing value. He must find some in order to be able to purchase more fuel for his lantern. Be careful, however, as there are dangers in the ground.\n\nHow deep can you go?\n\n## Update (Oct. 7, 2019)\n\nWe noticed a bug shortly after publishing that makes the game pretty unplayable in the lower levels. It was also mentioned in comments. The bugfix that has been uploaded is to fix this issue.\n\n## Controls\n\nYou can choose to use either WASD or ZQSD keys to control the prospector when he moves.\n\nThe arrow keys instruct him to dig in a particular direction.\n\nPressing the L key will place a ladder (if you have one) where you are standing.\n\nBe careful how deep you dig at a time as you can only jump up two tiles.\n\n## Contributions\n\nWe divided the work as follows:\n\n**James**: Coding\n\n**Cameron**: Graphics\n\n**Oliver**: Music\n\n**Anthony**: UI, Sounds\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![Screen1.png](///raw/158/2/z/275ba.png)\n\n![Screen2.png](///raw/158/2/z/275bb.png)\n\n![Screen3.png](///raw/158/2/z/275bc.png)\n\n![Screen4.png](///raw/158/2/z/275bd.png)\n\n![Screen5.png](///raw/158/2/z/275bf.png)\n\n![Screen6.png](///raw/158/2/z/275c0.png)\n\n![Screen7.png](///raw/158/2/z/275c1.png)\n\n![Screen8.png](///raw/158/2/z/275c2.png)\n\n## Review In Kind\n\nWe are always looking to improve what we are doing.

Has some major bugs, which prevent the game from being completed: When dying and respawning at a checkpoint, after getting the high-jump feature you lose your high-jump, which prevents the game from being completed (unless you beat it without dying). The order in which the music tracks are played are messed-up; you won't experience the intended flow of the music in this build. |\n| __1.0.1__ | [Windows][v1.0.1-windows] [Linux][v1.0.1-linux] | Partially fixes the music playing-order bug from v1.0.0 (still has some bugs). Was released about 20 minutes after the deadline. |\n| __1.0.2__ | [Windows][v1.0.2-windows] [Linux][v1.0.2-linux] | Properly fixes the music playing-order bug. Fixes the bug where player's high-jump is taken away after respawning, making the game beatable. Adds frame rate counter system, which prints FPS to the console.

As a newly hired floor worker at _The Company Fulfillment Center_, it is your job to package and ship orders as fast as they come in! Since you're new, we'll start your shift off easy. We'll drop off a box with nothing in it, and all you have to do is sort it, praise it, and put it in the truck. We'll walk you through the steps.\n\n\n## At a Glance\n\n1) Pick up boxes/products with **LMB / E**\n\n2) Open and close boxes with **F**\n\n3) Fill boxes with requested products on shipping label\n\n4) Close the boxes once filled, put filled boxes into Sorter. Press colored button (with **LMB / E**) corresponding to color on shipping label\n\n5) Put sorted boxes in their colors' Adulator, and follow the set of rules to determine the correct button\n\n6) Ship the boxes in the truck!\n\n\n## Controls\n\n**WASD** - _Move_\n\n**LMB/E** - _Pick up / drop box, press button_\n\n**RMB** - _Open box_\n\n**F** - _Open box_\n\n\n## Packing\n\n![dropped_box.png](///raw/f35/6/z/290c6.png)\n\nBoxes will arrive from the ceiling vent (it's super efficient!) Though your first few boxes will stay empty, eventually you'll get boxes with shipping labels that actually... you know, require you put products in them. For example, the following package requires a basketball, a coin, and a game controller:\n\n![box_with_shelves.PNG](///raw/f35/6/z/290c4.png)\n\nSimply pick up the products __(LMB or E key)__, open the box __(F key)__, and drop them in:\n\n![box_with_item_to_be_placed.PNG](///raw/f35/6/z/290c3.png)\n\nThen you're good to go!\n\n![box_with_item_fulfilled.PNG](///raw/f35/6/z/290c2.png)\n\n\n## Sorting\n\n![sorter_far.PNG](///raw/f35/6/z/290c7.png)\n\nOkay, so you've got a box filled with everything it demands. Now you've gotta sort it! Thankfully, this should be an easy process. **Make sure the box is closed and fully packed**, put it on the conveyor belt, and let the sorter suck that bad boy in! Then, you've just gotta press the big colored button __(E key)__ that matches the color on the boxes' shipping label. In the following example, just hit the big green button:\n\n![sorter.PNG](///raw/f35/6/z/290c8.png)\n\n__Make any mistakes, and the sorter will shoot that rejected package out so fast the rest of your packing line might face collateral damage!__\n\n\n## Adulating\n\n![screenshot_00.png](///raw/f35/6/z/27bbf.png)\n\nThese boxes aren't just any old boxes. They require praise and admiration before they will ship (needy, right?). After your boxes have been sorted, they'll gingerly convey their way over to their respective color's adulator. Here, you must follow a simple set of rules to properly praise the box!\n\nIn the example above, the blue box does not have an odd number of items, nor only 1 type of ball, nor multiple types of balls, so we tell the box it's doing \"Awesome work!\" and send it on its merry way!\n\n\n\n## Shipping\n\n![screenshot_03.png](///raw/f35/6/z/290cd.png)\n\nSo you've packed, sorted, and adulated your box. Now it's finally ready to ship! Pick it up, shove it in the back of the truck, and *run as fast as you can* back to the rest of the boxes! __We're not paying you to dilly-dally!__\n\n\n## Notes\n\nThis game was developed and tested primarily on Windows.

Our main concern was the AI, which we had no experience about. After less than 24 hours we realized that concept would not see the light of day in less than 72 hours, so we took what we had been doing (mapping and character creation) and went through with a soccer game where they use their shells as their main weapon.\n\nWe believe it ended being a very fun local VS experience (that you can play over the internet with applications like [parsec](https://parsecgaming.com/)). You can use the shell to knock your opponent, or you can shoot a very high speed coconut to knock him over! We had great fun with our friends!\n\n# What we did on the project:\n\n-All code was from scratch aside from one shader.\n\n-3D models, texturing, all done by us.\n\nThe only stuff we didn't do were the animations (Mixamo) and the music (even if we have a license to use the assets)\n\n\n# Controls:\n\n**Player1:** W A S D and Left Shift or Space for using shell spin\n\n**Player2:** Arrows and Right Control or NumPad 0 for using shell spin\n\n\n\n**We hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed doing it!**\n\n![screenshot1.jpg](///raw/a98/41/z/27c48.jpg)\n\n![screenshot2.jpg](///raw/a98/41/z/27c58.jpg)\n\n![screenshot3.jpg](///raw/a98/41/z/27c61.jpg)\n\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a98/41/z/27b62.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/cocoball","author":{"name":"blitzcloud","uid":84122,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a98/41/z/28c69.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/blitzcloud"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a98/41/z/27c48.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a98/41/z/27c48.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a98/41/z/27c58.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a98/41/z/27c58.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a98/41/z/27c61.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a98/41/z/27c61.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://blitzcloud.itch.io/cocoball"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1onFrl1EloeF1WuKvvKVS5hc7pvwznBmw"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://blitzcloud.itch.io/cocoball-low-quality"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ofnLtMxpbEwJchwD9yBn4rZKRk1AF0nb/view"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Cultivation","category":"jam","description":"## Red Owl Games - Making Games Together To Play Together\n\n\n![Screen Shot 2019-10-07 at 3.18.24 PM.png](///raw/508/22/z/28806.png)\n\nGrow a tree together.

If you have a combat module that is not connected to anything, you cannot build a new module starting from there or shoot it even if you have energy elsewhere. You need access to that energy through a connection.\n\nControls:\n- Q: Switch to building solar modules\n- W: Switch to building combat modules\n- E: Switch to building connections\n- Left click: Selects a module, or unselects if you click on empty space.\n- Right click: Builds a new module or link based on your current choice of q/w/e.\n- Spacebar: Shoots if you have a combat module selected.\n\nTo build a new module, select an existing module with left click, then right click within the range circle to build a new one.

One pocket is added for every shot taken where no ball is potted. If at least one ball (besides the cue ball) is potted in a shot, then the number of pockets remains the same and a new random set of pockets is selected.\n\nIf the cue ball is potted during a shot, one additional pocket is added to the table. If the cue ball touches no other ball during a shot, one additional pocket is added to the table. If the cue ball and any other ball is potted in the same shot, then one additional pocket is added for every other ball potted.\n\nAim your shot by left clicking and dragging anywhere on the screen. Take the shot by letting go of the left mouse button. The power is determined by the length of the drag, whilst the shot angle is determined by the angle of the drag.

Some times you'll lose the ability to jump: spawn little cubes and with \n   some collisions and enough luck, you'll go back to jumping in no time!\n - FIXED => the hint balloon can sometimes show multiple messages.\n - the click particle gets displayed even when it shouldn't. Also it is not aligned perfectly with the mouse cursor.\n\nOh and if you have a drawing tablet try it out! Spawning cubes with that can be quite addictive.\n\nLastly, this is not really a bug but, the black platforms idea was really a last minute change.

A lot of experience was gained and a lot of features weren't implemented. :smile: \n\n## Controls\n\n- WASD or Arrow Keys to move.\n- Space to start/go to the next level.\n- ESC to go back to the main screen/exit the game.\n\n## Known issues\n\n- Currently, the game forces fullscreen without the option to switch to windowed mode.\n- Eats memory like crazy.\n- Can skip a level by going into the main menu and playing again.\n\n## Post-Jam changes\n\n- Fixed typo in the word \"space\" on all screens.\n- Removed unused assets.\n- Enabled logging. **If the game crashes, please, send us the `output.log`.**\n\n## Tools\n\n**Rust** - the programming language of choice.  \n**Sublime Text** - best IDE ever.  \n**Sublime Merge** - GUI for Git.  \n**Adobe Illustrator** - for making art.  \n**DragonBones** - for animations.  \n**Dropbox** - for sharing work with the team.  \n\n## Credits\n\nProgramming  \nhttps://twitter.com/sigodme  \n\nDesign and art  \nhttps://www.instagram.com/romeowchik/  \nhttps://www.instagram.com/hedho_art/\n\nLevel creation & biology lessons :D  \nhttps://www.instagram.com/ambushing_goose/\n\nOST  \nhttps://www.instagram.com/ki.rill6159/","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//801/72/z/27cfb.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/mindmaze","author":{"name":"sigod","uid":160008,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//801/72/z/251fb.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/sigod"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//801/72/z/2988c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//801/72/z/2988c.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//801/72/z/27e07.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//801/72/z/27e07.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//801/72/z/27e0c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//801/72/z/27e0c.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//801/72/z/27e0e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//801/72/z/27e0e.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://sigod.itch.io/mindmaze"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/sigod/ludum-dare-45"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"💩","category":"jam","description":"you are nothing\n\njust a :poop:\n\ngo out\n\ndiscover yourself...\n\n![Screenshot_20191007-232542~2.png](///raw/fa1/a2/z/27bec.png)\n\n![273ca.png.320x256.fit.jpg](///raw/fa1/a2/z/27ba1.jpg)\n\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//fa1/a2/z/273ca.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/sim-the-poop","author":{"name":"panganaki","uid":172463,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/panganaki"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//fa1/a2/z/27bec.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//fa1/a2/z/27bec.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//fa1/a2/z/27ba1.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//fa1/a2/z/27ba1.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://markuslindgren.itch.io/spoop"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/Mackain/ldjam45/blob/master/downloads/windows.zip"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://github.com/Mackain/ldjam45/blob/master/downloads/poop.app.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://github.com/Mackain/ldjam45/blob/master/downloads/linux.zip"},{"label":"Other","url":"https://github.com/Mackain/ldjam45/blob/master/downloads/raspi.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Rainbow Restoration","category":"jam","description":"Start with nothing.

You start with one macrophage (a creepy pink fella), and one lymphocyte (a blue star-like fella) that can't make any antibodies yet. You have to control the macrophages so they can eat the invaders (green creepy things), and move the lymphocytes so that they make antibodies near the invadors' paths.\n\nThe point of the game is to defend the cell structures from the invaders. If all cell structures are destroyed, the game is lost. There are waves of enemies; once you survive them all, you win the game. Each wave activates a spawn point in a different tunnel (a total of 4), so make sure to spread your macrophages and lymphocytes across the map.\n\nMacrophages and lymphocytes can divide. Macrophages divide when they eat 10 invaders. Lymphocytes divide once, about a minute after creation. You can control every cell that has been divided.\n\nWhen you start the game, the lymphocytes can't produce antibodies. You have two choices: either move the lymphocyte so that it gets hit by an invader, or use a macrophage to eat an invader, and then share the genetic information with a lymphocyte. You can also move the lymphocyte so that it shares the genes with another lymphocyte.\n\nAntibodies slow down the invaders upon collision.\nWhen any cell gets hit by an invader, it loses health. Macrophages gain health when they eat an invader.\n\nControls:\n- Original version: Left click to select a unit, left click to set a target. Post-Jam version: Click on a macrophage or a lymphocyte, then right click on a target. CTRL+click to select multiple units.\n\n- Macrophages can go to a point on the floor, or they can chase invaders or lymphocytes.\n\n- Lymphocytes can go to a point on the floor.\n\n- Esc for main menu.\n\n- WASD or move mouse to screen edges to move camera.\n\n- QE or mouse wheel to move camera up/down.\n\nThat's pretty much it. I had plans for invaders to mutate, but I ran out of time.\n\nSometimes the invaders can get stuck in the cells. You can use the macrophages to eat them.\n\n**There are two versions available in the download: the original LD45 submission, and the one that introduces some changes to the game, as per this post: [https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/bodyville/a-big-update](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/bodyville/a-big-update).**\n\n![scr1.png](///raw/ed4/e1/z/27cd4.png)\n\n![scr2.png](///raw/ed4/e1/z/27ce1.png)\n\n![scr3.png](///raw/ed4/e1/z/27ced.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ed4/e1/z/27d39.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/bodyville","author":{"name":"kr0s","uid":124126,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/kr0s"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ed4/e1/z/27cd4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ed4/e1/z/27cd4.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ed4/e1/z/27ce1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ed4/e1/z/27ce1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ed4/e1/z/27ced.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ed4/e1/z/27ced.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://kr0s.itch.io/bodyville-ld45-edition"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Spam Space To Exist","category":"jam","description":"![Title.png](///raw/91b/3/z/26ee5.png)\n\n### Introduction\nYou are nothing. Well, for now. If you spam the spacebar in Spam Space To Exist you can exist, then you can get bigger by absorbing stuff! If you absorb enough stuff, you might be able to absorb the biggest stuff, like, say... a planet! The people living here are no fun and they don't much like that idea, so you'll have to absorb them too with all their silly technology.\n\n***\n\n### Game Objective\nYour objective in Spam Space To Exist is to exist as much as possible, which means getting really big. By touching floating debris you absorb it and it sticks to you, becoming you. When you get big enough, **your final goal is to absorb the local planet.** However, it is heavily defended.\n\nWhen useful technology sticks to you, it starts working for you. Weapons are especially useful for fending off enemies, but **these puny beings are also very susceptible to a good clobbering** by your mighty girth. **The bigger you are, the more damage you inflict when you bash enemies.** Destroyed enemy ships will drop their useful bits, good for absorbing.\n\n***\n\n### Controls\n(Available in-game)\n- Spacebar - Spam this to become something from nothing at the start (or if you get blown up)\n- WSAD or Arrow Keys - Move around\n- QE or Page Up/Down - Rotate\n\n***\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![screenshot2_cropped.png](///raw/91b/3/z/26ee3.png)\n\n![screenshot3_cropped.png](///raw/91b/3/z/26ee4.png)\n\n***\n\n### The Team\n\n- **Ketura** - Design, Programming\n- **Wheffle** - Programming, AI, Music, Sound Effects\n- **FieryVictoryStar** - Programming\n\nWe formed an ad-hoc team the day of the start of the jam.

If you run out of _Energy_, you faint - game over.\n* After each round you will receive a reward consisting of more _Energy_ and _Money_. The closer your number was to the _Target_ number the more _Energy_ you will get. Resolving the puzzle quickly will give you bonus money.\n\n## Pro tips:\n* _Sandstone_ (brown rock) is lighter than _Granite_ (grey rock), however it crumbles more easily.\n\n-----\n\n## Controls:\n\n### Movement\n* **W** or **Up Arrow** - move forward\n* **S** or **Down Arrow** - move backward\n* **A** or **Left Arrow** - move to the left\n* **D** or **Right Arrow** - move to the right\n\n### Actions\n* **Space** - Pick up or drop a nearby stone\n* **ESC** - Exit the game\n\n-----\n\n**We do really hope the game isn't too difficult or straight up boring.

Last levels with other map just for test.\n- Add skip level button. If you think that level very hard or want continue from specific level, use it :)\n- Fix all technical bugs what i found + a lot of refactoring\n- update webgl template for normal fullscreen\n\n**Change log 10.10.19**\n- Add mute button and lower music volume\n- Add html version. Now all can play... hope so :)\n- A little balance fixes, now blue bots have more chances to miss and can sometimes kill you in LMB spam(but not always) :) \n- change game name and add more tips in game\n\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0f2/82/z/2827a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/ld45-cyber-tentacles","author":{"name":"ChivaTateo","uid":164592,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/chivatateo"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0f2/82/z/28401.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0f2/82/z/28401.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0f2/82/z/28341.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0f2/82/z/28341.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BkGxBYTz1RDfu6AqfzGt_AgILVmqxwYf"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://chiva.itch.io/cyber-tails"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Area 45","category":"jam","description":"Agenda\n- Fart\n- Toot\n- Pray\n- Rage\n\nDon't let the GLOBALISTS :earth_americas: take your DOLLAR :moneybag:\n\n![ld45_ss_1.png](///raw/245/z/28684.png)\n![ld45_ss_2.png](///raw/245/z/28687.png)\n![ld45_ss_3.png](///raw/245/z/28688.png)\n\nController doesn't work for the Web version, so download if you'd prefer to not use a keyboard.\n\nAdded a post-jam version to the itch page.

You can the result either depicted to the right of the progress bar with an image, or in text form on the left side of the screen in the message area.\n- After the event resolves, you might get items dropped into your queue on the right based on how the event resolved. Make sure to drag these items into your bag quick, as the queue is cleared once the adventurer reaches the next event\n\n## Tips and Tricks (Spoilers):\n- For Combat, swords and sticks are useful\n- For Location, key is useful\n- For Wilderness, swords, sticks, bear hide, and meat are useful\n\n\n## What's unfinished:\n- HTML5 version\n- Proper game over/complete state\n- Better grid texture for the backpack\n- Fix tutorial errors ( Telling you to refresh the page to replay, but since it's not HTML5, you'll have to exit and restart the game, sorry!)\n- Needs more Content","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cb3/31/z/26dbb.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/bag-game","author":{"name":"Raphiell","uid":78780,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/raphiell"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cb3/31/z/26fcc.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cb3/31/z/26fcc.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/bz04r6ytejus84x/AdventureBag.zip?dl=0"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/oscmumnb9asc5db/AABvBS_tuppGEn1bkgSntCR3a?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Sword Of Nothing","category":"jam","description":"Armed with Nothing but the Nothing Sword, you set off for adventure.

We had a lot of fun and we are all very happy with what we have accomplished, though we had some difficulties along the road. \n\n\n**Things that could have gone smoother**\n\nAs mentioned before, we were very new to unity, we hadn't even tried the unity collab feature until just before the jam started. This lead to some tricky situations where merging conflicted and some progress was lost here and there, but we managed to restore everything to the state it was before the merge. We should have taken some more time before the jam to figure out how the unity collab feature worked. \n\nA few bugs were spotted along the way, some easier to fix than other, for example; dropping an item from the hotbar sometimes only removed the sprite but the slot was still occupied, this was a big problem as it happened quite frequently but in the end, we got it to work nicely! \n\nGetting animations to work properly has been a major difficulty, and we're still not quite satisfied with how some of them are looking, but that doesn't really impact gameplay too much.\n\nWe never felt like we wouldn't have enough time to complete the game, until the end of day 2(the last day we could work on the game together). We realised that there were a lot of features left to implement before we could publish the game, so we were quite stressed in the end of day 2 but we did manage to fix everything.\n\n\n**Things we are proud of**\n\nThe game is fully playable and most of the planned features have been implemented. We are very pleased with the look of the game, even if some animations are a bit weird. We added particles and sound effects to make the world feel more alive, though there could definitely be more. \n\nWe are very proud of what we have done in such a short space of time, we had a fully playable game by the end of day 2, and on day 3 we did some final polishing and bug fixing. \n\n\n**More about the game**\n\nNothin' To Muffin is a fast paced, time based game consisting of 2 main stages, the _road_ and the _store_. The objective of the game is to make it to the store while collecting recipes on the way. _Watch out for any dangers on the way which may cost you valuable time!_ \n\nAfter getting to the store, you will see all of the recipes you have collected, take a good look at them and try to remember what ingredients are required to bake those items. Then use the time you had left from the first stage to complete as many recipes as possible, you get more points for more advanced recipes and you lose points for items which aren't baking related. You have very limited inventory space so make sure to only grab what you need. At the end of the run, you get a score based on the recipes you completed, the amount of extra baking ingredients you had in your inventory(some items give negative points, watch out for those) and finally a time bonus multiplier. The game will automatically reset and a new run will will start. \n\n-We managed to get a total score of about 2850, can you do better?","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//04c/72/z/2742c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/nothin-to-muffin","author":{"name":"SP3sheep","uid":162880,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/sp3sheep"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//04c/72/z/26f8d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//04c/72/z/26f8d.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//04c/72/z/26f8e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//04c/72/z/26f8e.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://epa-productions.itch.io/nothin-to-muffin"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"WHILE (TRUE) { JAM(); }","category":"jam","description":"A Ludum Dare Game Jam Simulator created for the LD-45 Game Jam (\"Start With Nothing!\")!\n\nDive into the seat of a game jam developer flying solo on another jam hoping that all of the modules can be completed (at least to some degree) before the ludum dare timer runs down!\n\nMODULES:\n- **CODE**     (GAME_CODE.CS)\n- **ARTWORK**  (ARTWORK.PSD)\n- **MUSIC**    (MUSIC.MP3)\n\nFEATURES:(some working, some not)\n- **Manage Energy Levels** (if you let yourself crash you lose 8hrs of precious time)\n- **Eat Pizza** (2x slices available per day of the jam)\n- **Drink Coffee** (3x cups available per day)\n- **Sleep** (Re-Charge your energy levels - more effective than snacking but you lose time)\n- **Mini Games** that hopefully recreate the 'gist' of working on the various areas of a game (CODE, ARTWORK, MUSIC) in puzzle form)\n\nI hope you have the time to check it out, its not a long game and a lot of the features aren't yet finished but i had a blast working on it, so that's what counts!\n\n**WebGL(HTML5) version now active!**\n\nThanks","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//337/9/z/281da.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/while-true-jam","author":{"name":"cybersoftuk","uid":38707,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//337/9/z/64ec.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/cybersoftuk"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://gonnabesirens.itch.io/while-true-jam"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://gonnabesirens.itch.io/while-true-jam"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Reutemeteut (web)","category":"jam","description":"Reutemeteut.

If you continue this idea of growth you can see a bright future. You can become a CEO of a giant development firm. Who knows, maybe you will pile riches with ease.\n\nIf you don't want to wait for that to happen, this game will lead you through all those experiences in a classical clicker game.\n\n![P1.png](///raw/332/c/z/27a96.png)\n\n# In-depth explanation\n\nIn this clicker game a new ressource is added. With upgraded actions you gain SKILL, which has an influence on the probability of success. Just like knowledge determines your success in real life programming. If you don't succeed with an action you will lose half of what you would have gained. This means that you CAN in fact lose. If you do, don't worry, you can start from scratch again. :D\n\n![p2.png](///raw/332/c/z/27a98.png)\n![p3.png](///raw/332/c/z/27a9b.png)\n\nEvery action (sentential calculus, assembler and c# programming, working with a small dev group and leading a programming company) has four upgrades representing ways of getting better in each task: trial and error, video tutorials, participating at a Ludum Dare and professional support.\nIn order to successfully \"complete\" the game we want you to get to 1.000.000!\nAll of this follows just one big goal: piling money as much as possible!\n\n**PS**: Don't worry if your upgrades don't show the time saving any more.

We used an engine we never used before (Phaser 3) and didn't think out the features at the start. So with only a few hours to go the project looked more like a simulation instead of a game. In the last few hours, we hastily tried to put as many “Gameplay features” into it as possible. So a little sad about the fact that we haven't had any time to playtest, balance and polish, but still proud of the effort! We present you Force of nature. Time to wipe out humanity, like humanity wiped you out!\n\n# Controls\n* Use the arrow keys to scroll the viewed area\n* Drag cards onto overgrown tiles to build special plants\n* Click on the loudspeaker to turn of music\n\n\n# Mechanics\n\nYou wipe out the humans by overgrowing sector by sector. The more a sector is overgrown the fewer humans it can support. To help you do this you have three plants that cost different amounts of \"Growth Power\", displayed top left, that you earn by taking over tiles.\n\n* Cross Block Plant (free): Allows plant growth to spread to neighbouring sectors\n* Slowdown Plant (1O GP): Slows down the movement of all humans in this sector. This effect stacks.\n* Nature Fort (20 GP): A very sturdy tree that's not easily felled. Ideal to keep humans busy or protect your Slowdown's.\n\nOnce your spread reaches the threshold in the panic bar on the right the remaining humans will panic and start crossing sector boundaries. There are multiple ways to deal with this wave, either build large defences, or try to quickly expand in the now quieter territories to starve the humans. \n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//288/22/z/2930f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/force-of-nature","author":{"name":"RedZ0ner","uid":141442,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/redz0ner"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://redz-games.itch.io/force-of-nature"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"God Mode","category":"jam","description":"You are a God, who is creating a World, starting form nothing.\n\nCreated by:\nArtist: Angelos Streklas https://www.instagram.com/ulixes_628/\n\nDeveloper: Wojciech Debowicz\n\nControls: keyboard and in one scene mouse\n\n![cover_name_res.png](///raw/702/z/288e3.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//702/z/27b44.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/god-mode","author":{"name":"wdebowicz","uid":519,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/wdebowicz"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//702/z/288e3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//702/z/288e3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://wdebowicz.itch.io/god-mode"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/8203iusvprk5oy1/GodMode-win.zip?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Sorrow Quest","category":"jam","description":"![Screenshot (54).png](///raw/405/31/z/29849.png)\n\n#### Description:\nAfter failing to protect his Queen, the knight was imprisoned in the deep halls of the dungeon never to see a ray of sunshine again.

Use your power to summon forth beautiful blossoms and fill the vast emptiness with color. Be warned that your power is limited: you may not plant two blooms too close to each other, nor can you plant any but your first in the void itself. Your power builds over time, and planting blossoms consumes that power, so plant wisely!\n\nBeware: fiery sparks of all-consuming entropy will spawn from the void and attempt to tear through your precious blossoms. Even without their interference, your blossoms do not last forever: they will wither and die eventually. Plant anew, and fill the universe with beauty!\n\nMouse controls supported. Left click to plant flowers.\n\n**UPDATED 10/17/2019:** The Post-Jam version is now available! This version includes several visual, audio, and quality-of-life improvements: the power bar charges faster, the SFX have all been replaced to better fit the mood of the game, and there are now better indicators for when you can't place flowers (as well as an indicator for when you can). A title splash with basic instructions has also been added.\n\nPlease rate the game based on the original Jam version!\n\n![love_2019-10-06_21-09-44.png](///raw/1f3/1/z/26cc1.png)\n\n![love_2019-10-06_21-10-39.png](///raw/1f3/1/z/26cc2.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1f3/1/z/26cbc.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/blossoming-cosmos","author":{"name":"ryusui","uid":5105,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//1f3/1/z/4046.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/ryusui"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1f3/1/z/26cc1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//1f3/1/z/26cc1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1f3/1/z/26cc2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//1f3/1/z/26cc2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://watercrown.info/games/Blossoming-Windows-LD45.zip"},{"label":"Other","url":"http://watercrown.info/games/Blossoming-LD45.love"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://watercrown.info/games/Blossoming-Windows-Post-Jam.zip"},{"label":"Other","url":"http://watercrown.info/games/Blossoming-Post-Jam.love"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Hell Defender","category":"jam","description":"## One button VR wave shooter for Oculus Quest.

Naturally, you clicked \"Controls\" button like a weakling you are. I'm giving you the *last chance* to get the rest of your dignity and to go play the game like a **man**... You still there? Well, it's OK now, because I'm here. The whole thing is to build and defend your base from enemies. Simple stuff right? Let's start with the buildings available to you.\n\nYou got your generator *(I GOOOOT THE POOOWER)*. It's the heart of your base that generates electric impulses that move it all to life. An impulse will spread out and power all of your buildings, making them do their designed function and generally your base will appear to be more ***fancy*** than it actually is.\n\nMine *$Money Maker$* with each impulse will generate a small amount of currency. You need currency to set up new buildings. Cost of 'Mine' will increase depending on the amount of Mines you already posses. You can upgrade it to get more money per impulse.\n\n**Turret** is a basic defensive structure, that shoots lasers. With each upgrade, turret's damage and range is increased, making it more deadly.\n\n**Wall** is like, I uhhh... what else you want me to explain? IT'S A FUCKING WALL. Isn't it? Ok, it regenerates some of its hitpoints with each impulse. Walls' HP and HP-reg is increased with each upgrade.\n\nThere is also a limit to the amount of buildings you can set up. Sucks major ass, so we are giving you **Supply Depo** to increase number of structures you can have, so that's nice.\n\nAnd your enemies: energy thirsty spiders that want to get to your generator. **KILL THEM WITH CRUELTY.** If not, you will die and dying isn't exactly fun or interactive gameplay.\n\nThat's basically it. Go and play the game now.\n\n# Credits:\n## Programming:\n- Grzegorz Koperwas\n- Eryk Kściuczyk\n- Mikołaj Czarnecki\n- Michał Danikiewicz\n- Kamil Kowalski\n- Andrzej Kominek\n\n## Art:\n- Maja Więzik\n- Maja Oszczypała\n\n## Music:\n\n- Paweł Mendzik\n- Marcin Grabysz\n\n![Screen3.png](///raw/7e4/42/z/297b4.png)\n\n![Screen2.png](///raw/7e4/42/z/297b0.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//4d8/22/z/284e2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/survive-in-neon-lights","author":{"name":"HakierGrzonzo","uid":141524,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/hakiergrzonzo"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7e4/42/z/297b4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7e4/42/z/297b4.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7e4/42/z/297b0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7e4/42/z/297b0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/Eroar/LD_45"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/Eroar/LD_45/releases/tag/v1.1"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://github.com/Eroar/LD_45/releases/tag/v1.1"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"More Decor","category":"jam","description":"This was a 2-person project for the Ludum Dare 45 Jam - Theme: Start with nothing.\n\nThis is a puzzle game where you start with an empty room and you place furniture to earn points and unlock more furniture.\n\nYou earn 1 point for each piece of furniture that is placed on the left grid.

This looks awful and you will be straight back to managing smaller fields by the end of the year.\nUse 'scoop water' to pick up water from sources, use 'water' to distribute around your medium-sized field.\n\nPlace plants to get your medium-sized field looking as it should, and to ward off weeds that might appear.\nDifferent plants have different functions, but they must be watered and grown to maturity to perform those functions.\n\nBlue plant: pulls and distributes water to its surroundings\n\nPurply plant: drains water quickly from surroundings, good for depriving weeds of water and killing them. Also good for ruining the surrounding ecosystem.\n\nTree: defensive plant that can block water drainage when used correctly, prevents scrub from forming.\n\n(**you can read again now**)\nThe medium-sized field is yours now.

In some of the recent game jams I've done I had some trouble with overaiming on game design. So this time I went for a super simple concept. As we first planned the game would be a tiny bit challenging but we had a bug on a feature so our vision changed to a more relaxing theme. We adjusted the balance of the game to be very easy. The only way a player could lose takes at least 10 seconds of inattention. However not losing requires constant attention to your breath, just like real life :). Hope you enjoy a couple moment of relaxation.\n\nHi, I'm Berkay, the digital artist.\nYou can play the game by different mindsets, you can just play to have fun, or feel the ambiance and try to meditate with the character and notice 'your own thoughts'. \nI had so much fun while drawing the sprites, icons particularly.\nIn this project I've improved my layering and workflow skills. For the future projects I'm planning to focus on more shader-like graphics and animation. However It was an opportunity to amuse people with simple sketches. And it was so pleasant to know your game being played by random people in the world.\n \nControls:\nHold space to inhale,\nRelease to exhale.\n\nTools used:\nGodot Engine,\nKrita,\nAudacity.\n\n2019-10-09 Updated for minor input and animation bugs\n\n![ZenMaster.PNG](///raw/031/31/z/27ab3.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//031/31/z/27806.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/zen-master","author":{"name":"Onat Saygı","uid":78128,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/onat-sayg"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//031/31/z/27ab3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//031/31/z/27ab3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://nostrimo.itch.io/zen-master"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://nostrimo.itch.io/zen-master"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://nostrimo.itch.io/zen-master"},{"label":"Other","url":""}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"NOTHING TO LOSE","category":"jam","description":"BATTLE AFTER BATTLE, YOU'VE LOST EVERYTHING.\nTHE ENEMY HAS TAKEN YOUR LAND, YOUR LIFE AND YOU DIGNITY.\nNOW, YOU'RE ALONE, AND DESPERATE, SEARCHING FOR THE LAST BATTLE, WHERE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PROVE YOUR VALOUR AS A KING, AND FULFILL YOUR LIFE OBJECTIVE.\n\nKILL THE BEAST!\n\n\nYOU MUST ASSEMBLE A NEW ARMY, TO BE ABLE TO INVADE THE BEAST LAIR, AND SEEK FOR REVENGE.\n\n- HOW TO PLAY \n    - [L_MOUSE] TO MOVE\n    - [E] - ACTIONS\n\n\n- MODELS AND AUDIO FROM ASSETSTORE\nEVERYTHING ELSE, CREATED BY ME.\n\n- TOOLS\n    - UNITY\n    - VISUAL STUDIO CODE\n\n\n- FIXES\n    - FIXED BUG WHICH COULD APPEAR WHEN THE PLAYER PRESS E OUTSIDE CAMPS\n    - FIXED BUG WHICH COULD ALLOW UNITS TO SPAWN INSIDE TENTS.\n    - IMPROVED UNITS AVOIDANCES TO MAKE THE PATHFINDING BETTER.\n    - ADDED MESSAGE TO DISPLAY FOR WHEN THE PLAYER TRIES TO BUY SOMETHING AND THERE'S NO MONEY/FOOD","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f51/z/26dfa.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/nothing-to-lose-1","author":{"name":"Seththefirst","uid":351,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f51/z/946d.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/seththefirst"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://robertocaetano.com/ld45/"},{"label":"Other","url":""}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Good Pirate — Dead Pirate","category":"jam","description":"![2019-10-08_00-53-07.png](///raw/70c/72/z/27f3d.png)\n\nGood pirate is a dead pirate.\n\nThe game about barrels, powder and vengeance.\n\nRed Hook, the pirate baron killed all family of Ordinary Man.

As the cat, you will have to defend off waves of dogs, using temporary buffs that expire at the end of the round. Each turn you start with nothing, and you have to cleverly use each buff to defeat all the waves.\n\nHow to play\n==\nWASD or Arrows to move.\n\nLeft Ctrl or Left mouse button to swipe.\n\nLeft click on abilities to get their buff for *1 ROUND* only. Next round you *start with nothing*\n\nWin by stopping all the dogs from pooping in your litter box!\n\nSurvive 10 waves to go to the next level.\n\nAbilities \n==\n\n*Abilities can stack, but are lost at the new round.*\n\nClaws - Your attacks hit 3 times.\n\nFishy - You attack twice as fast.\n\nBone - Your attacks disable the dog for 1 second.\n\nWater - Your attacks slow the movement of the dog.\n\nCollar - Your cat now can push dogs around and block their movement.\n\nThere are 10 levels of 10 waves of \"randomly\" generated levels with constraints. \n\n\nSome details about the project:\n==\nI produced all code and game assets you see. Since this is my first submission, I skipped the compo, but I pretty much stuck to those rules. The only art asset that was made previously was my main cat character. I am a software developer by day, but I went art heavy this time as I couldn't think of a good idea for the theme and thought I could brute force good ratings with cute cats and pretty graphics.\n\nTools used:\n==\n\nUnity for the Game engine.\n\nOculus Medium for sculpting.\n\nBlender for model prep.\n\nSubstance Painter for texturing.\n\nInstant Mesh for fast retopology.\n\nVisual Studio 2019 for coding.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n==\nAll in all, I'm happy with how this turned out. I'm not happy with the game mechanics at all, and the idea of \"losing everything\" at the start of each turn is actually a terrible game mechanic, also you rarely want to use your powerups. \n\nBut apart from that, it was a lot of fun and I appreciate the opportunity to participate.\n\n\nI was doing updates but couldn't figure out how to post them without completing my game, so I left them in now.\n\n\nFirst update:\n==\n\nThe first set of assets done:\n\n![Game Jam pictures.png](///raw/c42/82/z/259ab.png)\n\nI still need to animate some of them, and some of them are starting to scare me a bit, but so far this is good enough to work with. \nSome feedback on my acquaintances who love it:\n\nPerson one: \"First one looks cool!\"\n\nPerson two: \"Electric, and I can’t stress this enough, chair\"\n\nPerson three: \"OK I'm not sure if this is going right 😅\"\n\n\nI've started on world generation.\n\n![Game Jam picture1.png](///raw/c42/82/z/259c8.png)\n\nI just need to hook this up to pathfinding and then I should be good to start on the enemy AI. The floor is possibly too bright, and the character is getting lost in it, but I will desaturate it later.\n\nUpdate 2:\n==\nOther art assets are complete! They are really starting to come together. They all start to show faults if you look closely at them.. so please don't...\n\n![9d0625c8-2418-47f3-ae07-6e9aab0023e7.jpg](///raw/c42/82/z/269b8.jpg)\n\n![7f307a88-e576-4981-8d18-538652c8f6b6.jpg](///raw/c42/82/z/269bb.jpg)\n\n![452c5513-a805-49d1-b0e6-8c8960ad47dc.jpg](///raw/c42/82/z/269bc.jpg)\n\n![ab27de48-5a40-41e7-b15c-505ba0321fb4.jpg](///raw/c42/82/z/269be.jpg)\n\nMy cat is finally fully kitted out!\n\n![6d0c09e4-9399-4a06-bd39-c4afcf5e1c7b.jpg](///raw/c42/82/z/269c5.jpg)\n\nThis guy slaps your dogs' ass, what do you do.\n==","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c42/82/z/268a8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/kitty-litter-defence","author":{"name":"Doodums","uid":164428,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/doodums"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c42/82/z/2692f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c42/82/z/2692f.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c42/82/z/259ab.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c42/82/z/259ab.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c42/82/z/259c8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c42/82/z/259c8.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c42/82/z/269b8.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c42/82/z/269b8.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c42/82/z/269bb.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c42/82/z/269bb.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c42/82/z/269bc.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c42/82/z/269bc.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c42/82/z/269be.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c42/82/z/269be.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c42/82/z/269c5.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c42/82/z/269c5.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PAQB5clivJrKnbIAtIZcUe-7PHAtmea8"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/ComradeMugabe/ludum-dare-kitty-litter-defence"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","vr"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Foxtrot","category":"jam","description":"Starting with no apples, the fox needs to collect apples in order to get more upgrades to ...collect more apples.

This game WILL WORK if you don’t have the peripherals, but the visual effect itself will be less powerful.\n\n## NOTE:\n### There has been some issues with understanding the objective so I'm going to give a few hints to get players started.\n\n1. Walk along the cliff to your left until you get to the two pillars in front of you. (Follow the lit path)\n2. Pick up the flask on the altar. This will lock you in place until the next step is complete.\n3. Look upward towards the large swirly star that is framed in the window of the pillars. (If not using Eye Tracking, place the 'no eye track' icon on the star. If using eye tracking, just look at the star)\n4. Once the star does what it does, there will be a clear path through the rest of the environment.\n\n![Screenshot_01_Hint.png](///raw/56b/2/z/28bb1.png)\n\nThis game is titled “All But Starlight Here” which is in reference to the poem Enosis by American transcendentalist poet Christopher Cranch. While enosis is a complicated political issue not addressed in this work, the poem is quite nice...\n\nThis game follows the letter but perhaps not spirit of the theme. I used this LD as an opportunity to construct an experience around an abstract visual effect I have been working on for some time. In short, this effect “adds detail” where the user is looking. If you are not using the Tobii Eye Tracking, ‘where the user is looking’ is set to the center of the screen where the ‘no eye track’ indicator is present.\n\n![Screenshot_02.png](///raw/56b/2/z/283d0.png)\n\nCONTROLS:\nThis game uses standard WASD and mouse controls, with left shift for a (slow) run and the space bar for a (short) jump. The jump is mostly used to free the player if they get stuck on some set geometry (usually it’s the steps down that give the character controller trouble).\n\nNOTE: This game is fairly intensive in terms of both graphics (visual effect) and CPU. I was unable to test this game on a variety of systems so I don’t know if it will work on Mac, Linux, or systems with integrated graphics. Please let me know if the game does not work at all for you, including the issue you’re seeing and your system specs and I’ll try to get another copy of the executable compiled.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nMatt Mitchell for the use of his Crotales\n\nAnna Martin and St. Michael Catholic Church for the use of their space for the purposes of recording.\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//56b/2/z/28916.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/all-but-starlight-here","author":{"name":"cottontshirtz","uid":11109,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/cottontshirtz"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//56b/2/z/28bb1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//56b/2/z/28bb1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//56b/2/z/283d0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//56b/2/z/283d0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://bit.ly/2pOfLk8"},{"label":"Other","url":""}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Stolen Goods","category":"jam","description":"Snoop around the house and steal all the items you have on your list!

Nothing is as it should be. But nothing is everything, and everything is nothing. So, does that mean you can put everything as it should be?\n\nThe object of the game is to use the various math operations to go from the original equation to one that is actually true, thereby \"proving\" the original equation.\n\nOperations include: \n- **The Law of the Mirror Image**: you may take the mirror image the equation, if possible for all digits, and retain the same result.\n- **The Law of Rotation**: as we all know, you may rotate the digits on each side of the equation by 90 or 180 degrees, if possible for all digits, and this will not change the result.\n- **The Laws of the Outside Digits**: You may remove the **same** digit from the front (leading digit) or back (trailing digit) of each side of the equation. You may insert the same leading digit to both sides. \n- **The Laws of Splitting and Merging**: Of course, you may deconstruct a digit into its parts, or construct a digit from its parts. For example, it is well known that an 8 is simply a 0 with a belt through it. You may remove the belt and place it to the left side, and therefore 8 = -0.\n\n![Screen Shot 2019-10-07 at 3.58.00 PM.png](///raw/658/72/z/27735.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//658/72/z/27726.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/i-dont-think-thats-math","author":{"name":"ratly","uid":1413,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/ratly"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//658/72/z/27735.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//658/72/z/27735.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://ratly.itch.io/bad-math"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://ratly.itch.io/badmath-original"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"There's only Dark and you're a Cube (TioDayaaC)","category":"jam","description":"Our first jam attempt, mostly as an exercise in Unity :)\n\nThis is a simple **MAZE** game where you search for keys and look for the exit.

Thanks for picking up my book. I'll try to guide you step by step\nin how to manage your own garden to make your colony completely self-sufficient!\n\n#### Ground preparation\n\nWell tilled soil is a must to make sure your plants will grow fast and big thanks to\neasier access to deeper, higher quality soil.\n\nAfter preparing the ground with tilling tool of your choice, it's highly advised to\nput crops in your new farming spot. Support will help your plants grow and it'll make\nbreeding easier and more manageable for you.\n\nThere are two types of crops.\nRegular one that can be used for planting and as ground for natural spreading and cross-crops\nused for breeding.\n\n#### Spreading\n\nEvery plant can spread around in a shape of \"+\" as long as there's tilled and cropped ground available.\nNew plant will be exact clone of its parent.\n\n#### Breeding\n\nBy planting two plants of any type with cross-crop in the middle there's a chance for you to get a new,\nmutated plant in the place of cross-crop. Child of two different parents will have it's statistics in the middle\nwith slight variations. This mechanic can be used to make your plants bigger, more nourishing and in the end,\nmake them evolve into completely new species!\n\n#### Additional information about plants\n\nHow much you get from a plants depends on it's size, it's root size and it's nutrition. Keep that in mind while breeding new types.\n\nSpeed of growth depends on plant's size and moisture absorption. Small plants with huge absorption grow the fastest.\n\nSpreading is a chance for your plant to mutate or spread to nearby tiles every hour.\n\nIn order for your plant to produce food on picking up it must be in it's fully grown state.\nIt's also true for both breeding and spreading.\n\n#### Compost\n\nYou can drop seed you don't need anymore here to get rid of them.\n\n#### Team Management, Food and Actions\n\nGardening is a hard job, and it's intergalactic edition is even harder. It may be helpful to get your friends to work.\n\nEvery healthy team member will grant you one additional action per turn.\nKeep them filled and happy to make sure you won't lose your precious action points.\n\nEvery team member needs one unit of food every 8 hours to keep working.\nIn case you've forgotten, our specie cannot die from starvation thanks to our hibernation mechanism.\nSo if your friend seems dead, you put a nice veggie in front of their face to put them on their feet.\n\nIn order to skip turn, click on your ship. It'll move the clock by one hour, tick your plants and refresh action points.\n\n#### Some more info:\n\n​You may have problems with images loading with a little delay. It's caused by game not pre-loading any data.

I have not participated in any game jams before, let alone published a game.\n\nIn this game, you start in a randomly generated island as a randomly generated character with randomly generated 8x8 textures. I am not a pixel artist, but I found that auto-generating textures leads to a much better aesthetic compared to anything that I could ever achieve manually.\n\nYou can walk around with WASD, arrow keys or xbox controller. You can cut down trees, destroy rocks or build a bridge by pressing the action key (space or xbox A button). If you stay in water too long, you will die. There is no goal in this game. Due to lack of ideas and time, this game is very primitive and lacking in many features.\n\nThis game was made using Godot engine. It's a wonderful engine that I found recently. I decided that making a game with it for a game jam would be a great way to become more experienced in using this engine. However, please don't take this project as an example of how to make a 2D game. The way I did collisions, among other things, are completely not how you're supposed to do it.\n\nWhen the next Ludum Dare rolls around, I will be sure to submit something that'll hopefully be more complete and I'll probably work in a team next time, since working alone proved to be a challenge in terms of coming up with ideas for the game.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//14e/72/z/27037.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/island-game","author":{"name":"aleks","uid":163393,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//14e/72/z/270ba.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/aleks"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://e1019.github.io/LDJam45web/"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/e1019/LDJam45"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://uirwe.itch.io/ldjam45"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Snow Country For Cold Men","category":"jam","description":"I unfortunately couldn't start until Saturday and was busy most of Sunday.

I have been working on some 2D games with unity and this may be the first 3D project for me. It was quite hard and I could not do anything in first 2 days (I was trying to understand 3D physics and colliders). I am happy with the final product with such a low time.\n\nI started my game design as creating my world and gameplay elements from nothingness. First idea was that, every step player took in game will change game world and environment. I dumped that idea almost fully because of lack of models. Final game is a combination of gone home and to the moon. I took mechanics and ideas from both games and implemented as much as I could. You need to explore world and listen story of an architect. Through optaining some memory pieces, player can unlock light sources to progress through game. There is not much mechanic when we think core game mechanics and there is only one simple puzzle. I hope you can enjoy and bare lots of bug.\n\n![Ekran Görüntüsü (2).png](///raw/377/92/z/27a70.png)\n![Ekran Görüntüsü (3).png](///raw/377/92/z/27a75.png)\n![Ekran Görüntüsü (4).png](///raw/377/92/z/27a7a.png)\n![Ekran Görüntüsü (1).png](///raw/377/92/z/27a80.png)\n\nBe aware remaining part is spoiler:\nActually what I tried to do with story is that, this architect is fine at first glance. Everything seems normal and just a little bit sad. But after each progress, mental statue of this architect became much worse. So, I implemented start with nothing as architect starts with no disease but develops some. I think with proper story writing and good object sets, this idea can work as a full game.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//377/92/z/27a6b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/nothing-found-a-ludum-dare-45-game","author":{"name":"despdair","uid":169843,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/despdair"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//377/92/z/27a70.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//377/92/z/27a70.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//377/92/z/27a75.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//377/92/z/27a75.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//377/92/z/27a7a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//377/92/z/27a7a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//377/92/z/27a80.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//377/92/z/27a80.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://despdair.itch.io/nothing-found-a-ludum-dare-45-game"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://despdair.itch.io/nothing-found-a-ludum-dare-45-game"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Don't RIP in Hell","category":"jam","description":"\n### Movements -> WASD\n\n### How to play -> Guide the Mobs around you to defend yourself.

I managed to get most of the base elements of the movement system that I wanted built, and with some further time spent on refining them, I believe I could eventually do everything I set out to do at the beginning of this Ludum Dare.\n\nI plan to write a full overview of my process on the creation of this game sometime soon.\n\n# Controls\n- WASD to move\n- Escape (in game) to exit to main menu | (in main menu) to close game\n- R to reset level\n- Space to jump\n- Note: Does not support controller\n\n# Images\n![2019-10-07 02_29_51-LD Jam 45.png](///raw/80f/82/z/26ebe.png)\n\n![2019-10-07 02_30_37-LD Jam 45.png](///raw/80f/82/z/26ec0.png)\n\n![2019-10-07 02_30_22-LD Jam 45.png](///raw/80f/82/z/26ebf.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//80f/82/z/26eb4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/running","author":{"name":"WelshDivision","uid":167688,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//80f/82/z/256f6.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/welshdivision"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//80f/82/z/26ebe.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//80f/82/z/26ebe.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//80f/82/z/26ec0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//80f/82/z/26ec0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//80f/82/z/26ebf.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//80f/82/z/26ebf.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=13LIjINc_P8MILSQalLBFgrz2OllM7uZW"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=11tnEvPRf2PLXrzL_PAtMoqvjDL56hGvP"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Desert Flight","category":"jam","description":"Controls: W and S and spacebar\n\n![flag4.png](///raw/9d1/z/258c1.png)\n\nYour task, to avoid birds with your airplane.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9d1/z/258c2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/desert-flight","author":{"name":"Tero Pulkkinen","uid":473,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9d1/z/151a2.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/tero-pulkkinen"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//9d1/z/258c1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//9d1/z/258c1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://meshpage.org/mesh_code?id=GVILK@805"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://meshpage.org/mesh.php?id=GVILK@805"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":45,"title":"Dumpy's Endless Quest for Crap","category":"jam","description":"![Logo 1.png](///raw/2a/z/27858.png)\n\n**Dumpy on a never-ended quest for crap, and he needs your help!**\n\nHelp Dumpy in his endless quest for power, money and kills!
