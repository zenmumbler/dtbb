Especially when leveraging web sockets in chrome. The speed is awesome considering it's HTML and people are used to this tech having a latency of a couple of seconds, nevermind 16ms!!.\n\nIf you're looking for the theme, it's the idea that you should take some team-mates into the middle of the maze with you, since you can't fight off the zombies on your own when carrying a jewel.\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/31b144e9b94baed61e9d053a71d5a03b.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-20/?action=preview&uid=2011","author":{"name":"goffmog","uid":2011,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8d94eedcc244b4f2345b69b83972afdb?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/goffmog/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2011-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2011-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://buffle.tinymadcow.com"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://buffle.tinymadcow.com/code.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":107,"score":3.19},{"area":"community","rank":129,"score":2.75},{"area":"humor","rank":180,"score":2.19},{"area":"theme","rank":195,"score":2.4},{"area":"overall","rank":213,"score":2.48},{"area":"fun","rank":215,"score":2.29},{"area":"audio","rank":218,"score":1.64},{"area":"coolness","rank":243,"score":0},{"area":"graphics","rank":261,"score":2}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":20,"title":"Myrktorch","category":"compo","description":"Myrktorch!\n\nSlay the undead with holy light!\n\nBeware of Ghosts!\n\n\nPost-Compo-Jam Update:\n-Added a way to acquire life.\n-Improved graphics, added lots of sounds and various tweaks.\n\n\n/If you plan on judging the game, remember to play the compo entry!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/7b8005d79e793ecea79a3d385b7574b7.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-20/?action=preview&uid=2648","author":{"name":"gugugu","uid":2648,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a22484f759dff7c8310bce64e4e8cd60?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/gugugu/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2648-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2648-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2648-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2648-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2648-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2648-shot2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Compo Entry","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/file/uz32hxfckb5uc71/myrktorch.zip"},{"label":"Jam Entry","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/file/egxer6gb2560db8/myrktorch.zip"},{"label":"*Final Version*","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/file/1ycx1ttenqgy48a/myrktorch.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.mediafire.com/file/se2o3wxo1cuuppw/Myrktorch03.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":15,"score":4.14},{"area":"overall","rank":37,"score":3.52},{"area":"fun","rank":45,"score":3.48},{"area":"innovation","rank":53,"score":3.48},{"area":"theme","rank":65,"score":3.29},{"area":"coolness","rank":103,"score":6},{"area":"audio","rank":118,"score":2.6},{"area":"humor","rank":248,"score":1.8},{"area":"community","rank":256,"score":1.77}],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":20,"title":"Party Favours","category":"compo","description":"What's more dangerous than being alone at a boring party?

It was developed in Chrome and a couple of modifications were made to port it to Firefox.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c189457c2d8fed3e51ca7dbf7ecfd313.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-20/?action=preview&uid=4002","author":{"name":"shiftingParadigms","uid":4002,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/09bc67a6be7d19d62b948e4491be1dfd?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/shiftingparadigms/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4002-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4002-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4002-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4002-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://marshaleaton.com/ld20/sprung.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://marshaleaton.com/ld20/source.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":103,"score":6},{"area":"innovation","rank":160,"score":2.83},{"area":"graphics","rank":180,"score":2.72},{"area":"community","rank":197,"score":2.22},{"area":"audio","rank":207,"score":1.78},{"area":"humor","rank":235,"score":1.86},{"area":"overall","rank":245,"score":2.26},{"area":"fun","rank":260,"score":1.95},{"area":"theme","rank":267,"score":1.69}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":20,"title":"Take It Take It Take This","category":"compo","description":"Wise Man's Wisdom Emporium and Item Dispensary: Take It Take It Take This!\nOne man's journey to give everyone what they want, or at the very least, something they wouldn't mind.\n\nGame is pretty simple.

Worse, should you drop an item, the enchantment will cause it to explode in a shower of flames, which will critically wound you if you are unfortunate enough to come into contact.\n\nYou must try to catch the items on your head, or let them fall and avoid the flames. The items will form a pile which becomes ever more precarious as it grows taller.\n\nUse the left and right arrow keys to move your character in the corresponding direction. When possible, move slowly by tapping the keys, in order to avoid causing the pile to collapse.\n\nNote to judges: I added Mochi high scores after the deadline. Also, the high score code isn't included in the source release in order to avoid revealing Mochi keys. The version with high scores is otherwise completely identical, but if you aren't happy with that, play the 'no high scores' version instead, which is what I originally submitted.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/137ccd513314a7f5418d344659ce4587.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-20/?action=preview&uid=2445","author":{"name":"Dan C","uid":2445,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/241fa4a7d249501f84ad0a6e4b9c2ae4?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/djcsdy/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2445-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2445-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2445-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2445-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Play Online","url":"http://www.danielcassidy.me.uk/games/itemquest.html"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/djcsdy/ld20"},{"label":"Play Online (no high scores)","url":"http://www.danielcassidy.me.uk/games/itemquest-noscores.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":59,"score":10},{"area":"humor","rank":88,"score":2.85},{"area":"community","rank":89,"score":3},{"area":"theme","rank":123,"score":2.86},{"area":"innovation","rank":131,"score":3.07},{"area":"fun","rank":132,"score":2.9},{"area":"graphics","rank":160,"score":2.83},{"area":"overall","rank":166,"score":2.79},{"area":"audio","rank":265,"score":1.33}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":20,"title":"Its not dangerous anymore","category":"compo","description":"\"Its not dangerous anymore\" is our arena rpg type of game where the objective is to slay hordes of little creatures. when you kill a certian amounts of enemy's 2 things happens.\n1. when the arena floor is covered in blood , rain will automaticly whipe it away.\n2. as you get through rounds you weapon upgrades itself. you start with a stick but you will sooner or later end up with a giant death lazor.\n\nThe game has a actual story line and a ending. we had loads of fun making the storyline so we hope you*ll enjoy it as much as we did.\n\nThe game automaticly also autosaves itself wich we find very awesome. we couldnt really \"finish\" all we wanted but it have been a great experience anyways!\n\nmight be a bit buggy, and we didnt really have time to make grades of difficulty. in fact, we didnt even test it:C anyways\n\nGo play it :D\n(Note: requires a good computer)\n\nCONTROLS: wasd for movement\nclick to attack(hold)\nF4 for fullscreen","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/79602492b64044b361f807bec7c685d5.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-20/?action=preview&uid=4074","author":{"name":"GoatFactory","uid":4074,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0d5d77a54babf1993c90643704b78acc?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/goatfactory/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4074-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4074-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.yoyogames.com/games/173395-its-not-dangerous-anymore-done"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":243,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":20,"title":"Lady Save Yourself!!!","category":"compo","description":"So this is my game.

Yes, you have a shop where people comes, buy a treasure and claim to every one that he has explored the dungeon, killed the monster and got the treasure ;)\nWith enough money you will be able to repair your ship and get the hell out of this damn planet !\n\n\nLeft & Right Arrow : Move\nUp Arrow & Space : Jump (when jump available)\nDown Arrow & X : Interact\nC & Z : shoot (when gun available)\n\nThere are some bugs on the original version :\n   - If your character don't appear on the screen after changing area, I'm sorry but you're screwed... this is a shitty tips but try to avoid returning to already visited area (when you don't have to).\n   - You can't re-enter your own shop... (anyway you don't have to do that to finish the game) \n\nIf you notice any bug please let me know in the comments !","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/740aca00b3438f524df7a509d0489515.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-20/?action=preview&uid=2908","author":{"name":"Bender","uid":2908,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5a3d6656326acb66de4bb7374f9ce7ad?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/bender/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2908-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2908-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2908-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2908-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2908-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2908-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2908-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/2908-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web [Flash]","url":"http://bender-labs.org/games/ld20/index.html"},{"label":"Bug fixes Version","url":"http://bender-labs.org/games/ld20-bugfixed/index.html"},{"label":"Sources","url":"http://bender-labs.org/games/ld20/ld20.zip"},{"label":"Sources [GitHub]","url":"http://github.com/julsam/LD20"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":11,"score":4.25},{"area":"community","rank":32,"score":3.54},{"area":"fun","rank":59,"score":3.4},{"area":"overall","rank":61,"score":3.38},{"area":"theme","rank":136,"score":2.75},{"area":"humor","rank":152,"score":2.42},{"area":"innovation","rank":195,"score":2.58},{"area":"coolness","rank":204,"score":1},{"area":"audio","rank":275,"score":1.25}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":20,"title":"Mystery Mansion","category":"compo","description":"","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/f5af6e8f77416abd0042fb643b64cf5a.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-20/?action=preview&uid=4244","author":{"name":"Killswitch","uid":4244,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e64509c8a02d9a0bddd2aa29a942739c?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/killswitch/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4244-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4244-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://download1239.mediafire.com/a96ug9wcob3g/t0ly8s472d3bu65/Mystery+Mansion.exe"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":243,"score":0}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":20,"title":"Nitro Racer","category":"compo","description":"A simple racer where the goal is to stay close to your opponents in order to survive.\n\nPlease note that this game works best in Firefox.\n\nEdit: I've added a fixed version that corrects a few things in the compo version.

that you must be carrying a cat to survive the dangers ahead.\n\nI consider this unfinished, even for a Ludum Dare entry. I spent way too long on the graphics, so unfortunately there is only one level and no sound at all. Plus the title is just weird.\n\nThe plan was to have different cats, each granting different abilities or power-ups. In the end there is just one, and it stops the Deathbots from shooting you but also causes them to come and give you a deadly hug. You must either be good at dodging them, or put the cat down to draw the Deathbots away from the exit.\n\nIts pretty freaking easy, but I feel like I've laid the ground for some deeper gameplay mechanics that would make for a more challenging game.\n\nEagle eyed players might note that I've been stylistically inspired by a game whose name rhymes with Sportal (even down to the exit signs on the floor!). I turned up the cuteness to 11 though.\n\nThis was my first Ludum Dare compo entry.

hosting my Flash game from my local Linux server. \n\nI developed my LD20 entry from my AS3 software 3d engine. My software 3d engine supports Collada models, Gouraud shading, normal lighting, and z buffering.\n\nThe game randomly generates maps. Pressing the \"Random\" button will generate a new map. Right now the player can collect keys scattered about the map.\n\nI modeled the models in Google Sketchup. \n\nUpdate on 5/6:\n\nI posted the link to the source tonight. It can be built with the Flex SDK. I also added a button for toggling the lighting. I included a screenshot with the lighting off.\n\nThanks for the feedback. I wrote this as a proof of concept.\n\nI first wrote this engine in JavaScript around four years ago. I started porting the engine to AS3 early last year. After porting it, I rewrote the hidden surface removal algorithms. The engine originally sorted the polygons with the Painter's algorithm.\n\nThis engine is not GPU accelerated.\n\nThe engine skips frames. It is not rendering every frame. While skipping frames increases the speed, the rendering can appear choppy.\n\nI decided to develop a game from this engine and stop working on it when I read about Molehill. \n\nUpdate on 5/7:\n\nI added a mechanic to the game. After collecting a key, the player can open a chest.

There are several rules of the game that I think I neglected to mention in the instructions:\n- You can rearrange supplies in the middle of bombing, by pressing \"Unready\". However, moving supplies like this will give them a temporary visibility increase, proportional to the distance moved. Spec Ops have no such movement penalty.\n- Rebel sentiment goes up on a hospital bombing only if you had supplies present in the hospital at the time. (This only applies to the first two cities, because after that you're forced to put some supplies in a hospital at all times.)\n\nTools used: AS3 with FlashPunk, sfxr, GXSCC, Paint.NET, Photoshop, and some public domain music/photographs. I never used FlashDevelop or worked with FlashPunk until this competition started, but I have to say that I like them both. Definitely an improvement over working with Macromedia Flash.\n\nUnlike LD19, where I was pretty much done after 24 hours, for this entry I was doing significant programming up until the last minutes. I guess part of it was because I was still learning FlashPunk, and part of it was because I was a little busy the weekend and had to take some breaks from LD. Overall, I didn't quite accomplish everything that I wanted to, but I think it turned out rather nicely.\n\nHalfway through, I began to have second thoughts about making this game, because it might look like I'm trivializing the Libyan civil war. This game is not intended as a joke or a mockery, but as a serious (albeit light) statement about violence, diplomacy, and power. I admit that it isn't exactly politically correct, and I sincerely apologize if anybody is offended by the subject matter or tone.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/88d04d430f4675ee347796d0621a1859.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-20/?action=preview&uid=3353","author":{"name":"BadgerPriest","uid":3353,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b60aa8e5bafe898f3390e505783d0c83?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/badgerpriest/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/3353-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/3353-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Flash","url":"http://www.nisnevich.com/alex/hosting/LD20.swf"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.nisnevich.com/alex/hosting/LD20.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"audio","rank":55,"score":3.24},{"area":"humor","rank":80,"score":2.89},{"area":"innovation","rank":113,"score":3.17},{"area":"graphics","rank":142,"score":2.93},{"area":"coolness","rank":156,"score":3},{"area":"theme","rank":160,"score":2.63},{"area":"overall","rank":160,"score":2.83},{"area":"fun","rank":195,"score":2.4},{"area":"community","rank":256,"score":1.77}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":20,"title":"My Minions","category":"compo","description":"The game doesn't really have a goal, build pathways for your minions to walk and\nmake them play sounds.

Now that that's out of the way...\nI know, it's not exactly \"It's dangerous out there!\" material, but unfortunately the time constraints of Ludum Dare forced me to go light on that. Originally the game was meant to have 25 levels with a text-based cutscene between every five levels, propelling a narrative involving your journey to adulthood and your father guiding you along. Like I said, time constraints caught up and the narrative had to be cut :/ However, the game WAS designed to tell a story about how your father gave you the Eunaborb in order to survive in the universe! The theme WAS considered! :P\n\nOther cut features include two more songs (one for the menu, one for the level editor) and the ability to load custom levels straight from the main menu, without having to go into the level editor.\n\nAnyway, I'm quite proud of what I managed to accomplish, especially considering I missed almost the first 12 hours of development :) The game has a full level editor (from scratch). You can import/export map codes directly, and you have three save slots in-game for your favorite maps!\n\n2 KNOWN GLITCHES:\n - After playing a level from within the PLAY GAME menu, player cannot return to root menu. Refresh the game to do so.\n - The mute button just doesn't work. Sorry :P\n\nYou can play the game online, download the source code .FLA, and also download the music (which includes the two music tracks that didn't make it in the final game).

Hope you enjoy.\n\nSome people have expressed difficulty in learning the controls ( my bad! Sorry! ) so I thought I'd quickly explain them here :\n\nOn the main screen (image 2) you have two options, on the left, is your Orphan list, Use this to look at your current Orphan Roster, and to Buy new Orphans.  On the right, is your District Map.  Use this to select which district you would like to go to.\n\nOnce in a district, use WASD to move your character around.  Your orphans will follow.\n\nTo send your orphans off to steal, mouse over your avatar, then click and drag out the path you wish your orphans to follow.  Release the mouse to stop drawing the path.  Then, press and hold space to select the number of Orphans you wish to follow that particular path.  Release space to send the orphans on their way.\n\nAt any time, you can flick your mousewheel to recall *all* orphans from every path.  They should stop what they are doing and head straight back to you.  This is pretty useful to avoid cops and the likes.\n\nHope that makes more sense!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e0239bcc9e35be35cb68400e11045e5a.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-20/?action=preview&uid=1282","author":{"name":"amassingham","uid":1282,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ed80fa489ad40659f4bdb8e74c5b5520?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/aa/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/1282-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/1282-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/1282-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/1282-shot1.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/1282-shot2.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/1282-shot2.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://tenfiftyfour.com/games/ManySmallHands/"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://tenfiftyfour.com/games/ManySmallHands/"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://tenfiftyfour.com/games/ManySmallHands/source/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":12,"score":3.93},{"area":"audio","rank":66,"score":3.04},{"area":"community","rank":66,"score":3.25},{"area":"coolness","rank":67,"score":9},{"area":"humor","rank":73,"score":2.92},{"area":"overall","rank":76,"score":3.29},{"area":"theme","rank":77,"score":3.14},{"area":"graphics","rank":87,"score":3.29},{"area":"fun","rank":133,"score":2.89}],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":20,"title":"Mine Escape","category":"compo","description":"A platform game where you control a miner trying to navigate his way out of a mine.

It works fine on the latest version Firefox and Chrome, but the framerate is better in Firefox.\n\nYour task is to control the satellite to send power to the earth and the space craft leaving it. If you missfire then the deadly laser will produce deadly neurotoxins, which lower your maximum possible score.\n\nI used the PhiloGL framework to produce this after first trying three.js and finding it to be impossible to use more than one texture per shader. PhiloGL was not much better, there appears to be some bugs with its vec4.distTo method and I had to make numerous other small changes to support multiple shaders.\n\nAll the animation/events are framelocked, so people with slower computers will find this game easier to play.\n\nKnown issues -\n* The sound is sometimes a bit erratic. The HTML5 implementation for audio sometimes lags.\n* Sometimes Firefox will silently complain that the textures are corrupt and then carry on as if nothing has happened. I think this is something to do with the FF caching the texture images incorrectly.\n* It does not work in IE","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/2215aefa743bcc9708a025583b232ad1.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-20/?action=preview&uid=4461","author":{"name":"markit","uid":4461,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/342142dc2b8bd2a95d0339269663d13b?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/markit/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4461-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4461-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4461-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4461-shot1.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4461-shot2.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4461-shot2.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://seken.co.uk/ludlum-20"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://github.com/seken/ludlum-20"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":47,"score":3.53},{"area":"coolness","rank":119,"score":5},{"area":"audio","rank":170,"score":2.17},{"area":"graphics","rank":190,"score":2.67},{"area":"overall","rank":200,"score":2.53},{"area":"theme","rank":251,"score":1.92},{"area":"fun","rank":255,"score":2},{"area":"community","rank":269,"score":1.67},{"area":"humor","rank":272,"score":1.57}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":20,"title":"ZombieRunner...Ware","category":"compo","description":"[Quickly updated notes]\n\nControls:\nMouse clicks for dialog and activating the activatable item.\nMouse aim for aiming the aimable item.\nW for jumping.\nA and D for slight decrease or increase in running speed.\nBrain for the patience to see all three (11!!1) items.\n\nThere is a gameover screen if you can manage to completely ignore the controls and fail even basic reflexive and eye-hand coordination tests.

Did a couple minor things to make it a bit harder, largely based on people's feedback.  In short: More enemies, less flares, no paths from start to exit by just following the walls.  More updates soon.\n\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/2908100/TBeck%20-%20LD%2020%20-%20Update.swf\n\nTLDR:\n  Arrow Keys - Move\n  Left Click - Place Flare (Aim w/ Mouse)\n  The closer you are to a monster, the faster the sonar beeps.  Shoot flares to kill/reveal enemies.  \n\nThanks for your feedback, I will start working on updates tomorrow and put a link to newer versions here (though obviously the official competition version will remain as-is).\n\nDescription:\n\nThe easiest way to describe my game is that it's Minesweeper, except you control an actual character and instead of visual clues where the 'mines' are, there are audio clues.  The character has a sonar device which beeps faster/high pitched the closer you get to an enemy.  Walk into a square adjacent to an enemy, and you're dead.  \n\nIf you think you know where an enemy is, you can throw one of your limited supply of flares.  If the area the flare lights up overlaps with an enemy, it dies.  Also, enemies won't attack you on lit-up tiles, even if it's within their range.\n\nYour goal is to make it through a series of randomly generated caves to make it through to the other side.  As you progress into deeper caves, the monster count increases.  Eventually, the number of flares you get per level starts to decrease.  If you can make it through the final level, with 10 enemies and 0 flares, you win!\n\nIf you die, your choices are to retry the same layout, try a different layout with the same parameters, or give up, leading to the game over screen (which you may as well check out at least once).  Additionally, there are two different difficulty modes.  The differences are described in-game.\n\n\nTools Used:\n\nLanguage: Flash/Actionscript 3\nIDE: FlashDevelop\nGame Library: Flixel\nMap Editor: DAME (Very sparingly, mostly randomized levels)\nMusic: LSDj in Visual Boy Advance\nSound Effects: Spear & Audacity\nArt: GIMP 2","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a1f8d598ecd9d79e2a94d859c156c28b.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-20/?action=preview&uid=3827","author":{"name":"fueelin","uid":3827,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/74739ff1cdbcf79637582fe03e77b6fe?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/fueelin/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/3827-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/3827-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/3827-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/3827-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2908100/Tim%20Beck%20-%20LD%2020%20-%20It%20is%20Dangerous%20to%20Go%20Alone%20in%20the%20Dark.swf"},{"label":"Web (Post-Comp Update)","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2908100/TBeck%20-%20LD%2020%20-%20Update.swf"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2908100/Source%20Code.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":75,"score":3.33},{"area":"audio","rank":81,"score":2.88},{"area":"coolness","rank":86,"score":7},{"area":"theme","rank":91,"score":3},{"area":"community","rank":115,"score":2.87},{"area":"fun","rank":123,"score":2.96},{"area":"overall","rank":127,"score":3},{"area":"graphics","rank":229,"score":2.33},{"area":"humor","rank":231,"score":1.88}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":20,"title":"Leaving the Vault","category":"compo","description":"Leaving the Vault ~ It's Dangerous to Go Alone\nA game by John Colburn\n\n===QUICK CONTROL SUMMARY===\nMovement: ARROW KEYS or WASD\nAction: SPACE BAR\nFullscreen: F11\n\n  Only you can save your vault from extinction!

Have fun!","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/5163774f667753a2093526a166c0e3bf.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-20/?action=preview&uid=3863","author":{"name":"venzon","uid":3863,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3c44ec4c086e8b38f9f5029cbd8de1ce?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/venzon/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/3863-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/3863-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/3863-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/3863-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows + Source","url":"http://www.venzon.org/files/ld20/ld20-king-final.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":8,"score":3.9},{"area":"audio","rank":31,"score":3.5},{"area":"theme","rank":41,"score":3.5},{"area":"humor","rank":52,"score":3.07},{"area":"fun","rank":71,"score":3.31},{"area":"coolness","rank":86,"score":7},{"area":"innovation","rank":107,"score":3.19},{"area":"overall","rank":127,"score":3},{"area":"graphics","rank":204,"score":2.56}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":20,"title":"LD #20 - Never Let Go, Sam!","category":"compo","description":"Just renamed the \"Windows\" link to \"Web\" (I didn't realize at the time it could be edited).\n\nI still have to edit a major issue with the loading-screen freezing at startup, the game can't be played.\n\nI imagine those kinds of show-stopper bugs can be fixed without affecting the game's \"eligibility\" in the compo?","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/347a5183e794f85df633c0cd271575b7.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-20/?action=preview&uid=4398","author":{"name":"chamberlainpi","uid":4398,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4ddf46ea74893f3f6910a18a68cbd3a4?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/chamberlainpi/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4398-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4398-shot0.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4398-shot1.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4398-shot1.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://pierrechamberlain.ca/demo.php?demo=NeverLetGoSam&folder=others"}],"ratings":[{"area":"graphics","rank":75,"score":3.4},{"area":"community","rank":122,"score":2.82},{"area":"humor","rank":142,"score":2.44},{"area":"theme","rank":180,"score":2.5},{"area":"overall","rank":189,"score":2.6},{"area":"audio","rank":210,"score":1.71},{"area":"fun","rank":212,"score":2.3},{"area":"innovation","rank":217,"score":2.4},{"area":"coolness","rank":243,"score":0}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":20,"title":"Legend of Parasite","category":"compo","description":"","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/eb6946f8b5064aa8e44873db5a4ac1d3.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-20/?action=preview&uid=741","author":{"name":"Draknek","uid":741,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1ed1b5bd39da55997b174105bb865a41?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/draknek/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/741-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/741-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/741-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/741-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.draknek.org/games/parasite/"},{"label":"Source","url":"https://github.com/Draknek/Legend-of-Parasite"},{"label":"Timelapse","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBrP8Tudpmc"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":29,"score":3.75},{"area":"coolness","rank":86,"score":7},{"area":"graphics","rank":91,"score":3.25},{"area":"overall","rank":108,"score":3.1},{"area":"fun","rank":123,"score":2.96},{"area":"community","rank":141,"score":2.68},{"area":"humor","rank":178,"score":2.2},{"area":"theme","rank":224,"score":2.2},{"area":"audio","rank":269,"score":1.32}],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":20,"title":"Misunderstood","category":"compo","description":"First participation.

Most distros also have packages for PyGame, but if you can't find a package for it, use `easy_install`:\n\n    easy_install pygame","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/744a331724ebd30ce8577541e58e649e.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-20/?action=preview&uid=4408","author":{"name":"whitelynx","uid":4408,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2d6bbc0de25c42caf1b4ac2ed2fe2a79?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/whitelynx/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4408-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4408-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4408-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/45257/4408-shot1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Multi-Platform","url":"http://skewedaspect.com/ld20x6/LD20X6-LD20-entry.zip"},{"label":"Website","url":"http://projects.g33xnexus.com/ld20x6"},{"label":"Source (Bazaar)","url":"http://dev.skewedaspect.com/bzr/whitelynx/ld20x6/trunk/"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":204,"score":1}],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":20,"title":"Ngurvilar in the Temple Of Bastet","category":"compo","description":"Control the Orb of Ngurvilar with your thoughts.

Take sis!\"\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a short platformer written in Flash for the competition. I used (and modified) the same \"physics engine\" and tile library I used and modified for \"Disco? Very!\" and some other games. All the content is new and then some.\n\nThe chief innovation here is that the game is controlled entirely with mouse motion (no buttons). It's fairly intuitive, although it may be realistically frustrating. :) The ending should be pretty easy to find. If you're hardcore enough to collect everything then there's a little bit extra.\n\nFeatures:\n - 4 original tunes, some with lyrics and everything! A new record!\n - 25 accessible rooms, some more interesting than others. :)\n - Biologically plausible seeking behavior!\n - Single-input gameplay! Go ahead and use an eye-tracker!\n - Surprise ending!\n\nI may polish up some of the jumps for a post-compo version, since some are fiddly. Hint: Line-of-sight matters and the cats have different behaviors.\n\nI recorded a timelapse, with picture-in-picture webcam.
