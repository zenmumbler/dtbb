You can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonal.\n*Note that when you move, the adjacent tile you're moving away from will move with you.\n### [Tab]\nUse [Tab] if you get stuck, it will kill the player and return you to the shop keeper.\n### [F1]\nLowers the resolution of the game for smaller screens\n### [F2]\nBrings the resolution back to normal.\n \n# Tiles\n### [Multiplier wand] \nMultiplies the power of all tiles adjacent by the wand's power. Can multiply anything including additional wands.\n### [Potions]\nHeals the player for it's power.\n### [Scrolls]\nGives the player a random spell with the scrolls power as a modifier.\n### [Monsters]\nVarious monsters roam the dungeons 15 floors. On every floor, on monster holds the key to the stair case that will allow you to progress.\n### [Stair Case]\nStepping on this tile with the key will allow you to progress to the next floor.\n\n# Combo System\nIf you manage to kill more than one creature in a row, you'll be awarded with a combo! Each time you receive a combo you'll gain a souls multiplier and health based bonus based on the number of combos you've chained. \n\n# Gameplay\nIn Consume, you move around the board by clicking on adjacent tiles with your mouse. If you enter a tile occupied by an enemy, you will need to trade your own life force to absorb their soul. Souls are used as currency to be exchanged for permanent upgrades from the shopkeeper, he is found when you meet your inevitable demise. Spell scrolls can also be found scattered throughout the dungeon floors (spells do not consume life force to cast). Other items that can be found inside the dungeon are health potions and multiplier wands (this item multiplies number values of both health potions and enemies in adjacent tiles, so use wisely). Consume also uses a combo system, absorb multiple enemies in a row to reduce the amount of life force used and recieve additional souls to exchange for permanent upgrades.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//693/2/z/237c2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/consume","author":{"name":"ghost-in-the-toast","uid":9110,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//693/2/z/25141.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/ghost-in-the-toast"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//693/2/z/237c8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//693/2/z/237c8.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//693/2/z/233be.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//693/2/z/233be.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//693/2/z/233c4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//693/2/z/233c4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dtGyB7j-qWtagrxq1RStOpX3OUlwS0Dc"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1puZlG-UilGkhf9zJGCUXyEPMr9rg2oeZ"},{"label":"web","url":"https://soundcloud.com/officialconduit/sets/consume-official-soundtrack"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Drytown","category":"jam","description":"A 1 bit, topdown game were your health is the most valuable resource for the citizens of Drytown.\n\n![gif_postday_2.gif](///raw/0eb/z/23a9b.gif)\n\nDrytown, the old vampire village is doomed to failure due to the lack of fresh blood since the human disappearance after the last \"Great War\", that is true until an airhead human appears in the town brought by the train.

To goal is to beat 24 increasingly difficult rooms to get to the final Boss and earn your freedom.\n.\n\n\n\n## **Need some help?**\nIf a Puzzle is too difficult you can always **Pay life coins to skip it**. Simply go to the Blood-well and press the **[E]** key.\n![1.png](///raw/db1/6/z/23cc2.png)\n.\n\n\n\n\n## **Armor**\nEach piece of armor provides you a 1/3 chance to block incoming damage.

It is worth saying that I used a lot of music and sound effect generators for this game, that was later mixed with some of my voice and drum/flute samples till I get an original and meaningful soundtrack.\n\n![1cd00.png](///raw/69c/1/z/221fe.png)\n### ChangeLog\n\nThe version for download **has been modified** after the weekend, in order to:\n\n[Version 1.0.0.1]\n- Fix a bug that would stick the player on the afterlife of the game.\n- Fix a bug that would prevent the game from continuing whenever an enemy fell out of the map on specific waves.\n\n[Version 1.0.0.2]\n- Gameover screen is faster.\n- Upgrades are cheaper.\n- Shopkeeper's dialogue is faster.\n- Spawn time is faster.\n- You can restart the game.\n- Enemies reset attack timer after dash encounter.\n- Camera correctly looks at the player if he falls from the map.\n- Game starts in fullscreen.\n- Samurai's icon should look sharper.\n\n**Original source and executable at the [Compo - Original] link.** *This version may get stuck at some points of the game, in this case, the only alternative is to restart the executable.*\n\n![1cd00.png](///raw/69c/1/z/221fe.png)\n### That's it\n**I hope you enjoy my game! :)**\n\n*Please, let me a comment to know what you think about the game, this way I can also play yours later!*","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//69c/1/z/2181e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/heartaker","author":{"name":"lukbebalduke","uid":7318,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//69c/1/z/1f772.gif","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/lukbebalduke"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//69c/1/z/22117.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//69c/1/z/22117.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//69c/1/z/221a6.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//69c/1/z/221a6.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//69c/1/z/221a7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//69c/1/z/221a7.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//69c/1/z/221a8.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//69c/1/z/221a8.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//69c/1/z/22117.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//69c/1/z/22117.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//69c/1/z/221fe.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//69c/1/z/221fe.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//69c/1/z/221fe.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//69c/1/z/221fe.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//69c/1/z/221fe.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//69c/1/z/221fe.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//69c/1/z/221fe.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//69c/1/z/221fe.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://bit.ly/2V7Pigt"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/1lfzrkbqvu4xwms/Heartaker.zip?dl=0"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/vfpfzf9iihunpwd/Heartaker.yyz?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Digital Gray","category":"jam","description":"CURRENT HIGH SCORE: 1191 (chopstick)\n\nYou are the only one left.\n\nThe last drop of light in a dark world.\n\nThe last human among machines.\n\nDigital gray.\n\n\n![GIF.gif](///raw/ce9/2/z/22a77.gif)\n\n\nControls: \n\nWASD to move (press K and L to toggle ZQSD)\n\nMouse + Left click to aim and shoot\n\nRight click to dash (once unlocked)\n\nSpace when standing on the upgrade station to... upgrade\n\n(Note: you need full energy to do so)\n\nE: Toggle screenshake\n\nR: Start game\n\nEsc: close game\n\n\n![gif2.gif](///raw/ce9/2/z/22a7c.gif)\n\n\n\nYour objective: destroy all the machines.

If we take 'Your life is currency' as a statement directed at the reader it reads 'My life is currency' or put another way 'My life has value', 'My life is meaningful'.

You decide to read it. Big mistake, you are now a devout worshipper of Az'gath the Slain. You must do everything in your power to summon him from the depths of hell. Even sacrificing yourself and the lives of fellow cultists to achieve your goal.\n\n## Clarification of the rules\n**NOTE**: If you want to discover the mechanics of the game yourself, don't read this.\n\nThe end goal of the game is to summon Az'gath the slain. To summon him you play the card \"Ultimate Summoning\".\nFor you to be able to play the card you need to awaken the Triad of Destruction. The according crystal in the summoning circle will light up when a member of the triad of destruction has been summoned. After three days you will get the first card to start this quest.\n \n## Clarifications of the mechanics\nYou have two types of cards: Sacrifice Cards & Event Cards. Sacrifice Cards reside to the left and Event Cards to the right. You can play a maximum of three cards per turn but only one sacrifice card per turn. The gems in the top right corner light up to indicate the cards played this turn. If you press the Favor meter in the bottom center you can draw a second card at the cost of 10 favor\n\nIn the top left corner there is a suspicion meter. The gem will change color from green to red as you gain more suspicion. When the gem turns completely red (when suspicion reaches 20+) there's a chance to trigger a raid event. If the raid event is triggered you lose your suspicion, cultists and favor.\n\n![ScreenShot.PNG](///raw/cfa/z/232d5.png)![ScreenShot2_Compresesed.PNG](///raw/cfa/z/23381.png)![ScreenShot3_Compressed.PNG](///raw/cfa/z/23384.png)\n\n**Changelog:**\n+ Fixed a bug where failing to summon a demon would sometimes give you two summon cards back\n+ Fixed various graphical issues pertaining to cards and the card overlays\n+ Fixed some mismatches between what cards say they do and what they actually do","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8a7/z/23635.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/the-cult-of-the-midnight-sun","author":{"name":"TheGamer1123211","uid":1960,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/thegamer1123211"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cfa/z/232d5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cfa/z/232d5.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cfa/z/23381.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cfa/z/23381.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cfa/z/23384.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cfa/z/23384.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.mediafire.com/file/c7564oc7jy7hcvo/WindowsFixed.zip/file"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://www.mediafire.com/file/c7cw53szbb9j7a4/The_Cult_of_the_Morning_Star_-_Linux.zip/file"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://www.mediafire.com/file/8bmrualnl9z43ng/The_Cult_of_the_Morning_Star_-_Mac_OSX.app.zip/file"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux","mac"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Blood and goods","category":"jam","description":"**‚ö†Ô∏èIMPORTANT: We have been rated many times and we're really grateful for it, please consider rating a few other games that could be in danger before playing and rating this one‚ö†Ô∏è**\n\n\n\n\n**Come in hero...**\n\nVisit the most dangerous dungeon rooms where all your decisions will be affected by the amount of blood you're willing to pay...\n\n\t\n‚öîÔ∏è**Horripilant creatures**\n\n>Choose wisely between doing a sacrifice to your enemies in exchange to let you advance through corridors, or jump into the action and slay them to show who's the typing boss here\n\n\t\nüß±**Greedy merchants**\n\n>A whole arsenal of over 20 items is at your disposal, if you can afford it with your own blood to feed the creature that merchant hides in its chest\n\n\t\n‚õ≤**A mysterious fountain**\n\n>You see a suspicious statue with blood coming through its mouth, what could go wrong if you drink from it ?\n\n\t\n‚ò†Ô∏è**Deadly brutes**\n\n>No one wants to face any of these brute creatures, some stories claim that they don't want your blood...

The game is otherwise the same, you're just less likely to fall into a messy pit of bugs.\n\n### How it works\n\nThe game uses a pattern recognition algorithm that I developed entirely during the 48 hour jam period. The algorithm scales your drawing to a constant size, then compares it against all the patterns in the game. The main feature of the algorithm is flexibility; each step has a wide range of acceptable inputs to ensure that a match is found. Unity source code available below.

Pick off only as many as you can afford, since you also need them to create more followers for you!\n\nYour followers will fall in love, grow old, and die. If you arm them, they'll even fight for you (but they're bad at it).\n\nThe basics (most of this is explained in-game too):\n- Followers will only fall in love (and thus make new followers) if there's available housing. So start by making some houses.\n- Use towers and smithies for defense.\n- Use temples to gain followers faster.\n- Use graveyards and statues to gain power faster.\n- **The bonuses granted by temples, graveyards, and statues each stack up to 10 times.**\n- If you have a lot of power but not enough followers, choose a follower and press [E] to make them spontaneously have a baby. An EVIL baby.

Luckily you have the plants to keep you company. However, the plants needs water to grow up, and the only water source is YOUR OWN BODY. What's more, you have to defend your garden from the endless monsters in the night, and your only weapon is also the liquid inside you. How long can you survive, when the only resource is the current inside you?\n\n**Plant seeds into the soil, water them, and they will bear fruits in the following days. The fruits can either rehydrate the water sprite or give you permanent buffs. Defeat the monsters in the night to find more seeds.**\n\n## How to Play\n\n**In the Days**: Use WASD to move. Move near a block of soil to plant seeds. You should water them so that they can bear fruits in the following days. CLICK THE CLOCK in the bottom-right, when you are ready, to enter the night.\n\n**In the Nights**: Use WASD to move. Hold left mouse button to shoot bullets. Click right mouse button to throw bombs towards the cursor.\n\n![9.png](///raw/4f9/32/z/23cf3.png)\n\n## Tips\n\n**Use right click wisely.** Water bomb can do AOE damage but will cost you considerable health in the beginning period.\n\n**Don't water all the seeds you have.** Make sure you have a good health bar for the night fight.\n\n**100 HP is not maximum health.** The character have 3 states with different full health.\n\n**The Ghost is invincible before it splits.** Sorry, maybe it's a bug that we have no art effect to show this. If it come near enough to you it will split. Please let it split first then attack it.\n\n![bS5TTe.png](///raw/62d/32/z/2433e.png)\n\n## Videos & Screenshots\n\nhttps://youtu.be/X7Tjby7DQeE\n\n![1](///raw/b89/32/z/22e49.png)\n\n![2](///raw/b89/32/z/22e56.png)\n\n![3](///raw/b89/32/z/22e5f.png)\n\nEnjoy our game!\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b89/32/z/22582.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/the-last-drop","author":{"name":"Fiiction","uid":145803,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b89/32/z/24a0a.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/fiiction"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//62d/32/z/24356.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//62d/32/z/24356.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//4f9/32/z/23cf3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//4f9/32/z/23cf3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//62d/32/z/2433e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//62d/32/z/2433e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b89/32/z/22e49.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b89/32/z/22e49.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b89/32/z/22e56.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b89/32/z/22e56.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b89/32/z/22e5f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b89/32/z/22e5f.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://inamika.itch.io/the-last-drop"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://inamika.itch.io/the-last-drop"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/PoPoQQQ/WaterSprite/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Fair n Square","category":"compo","description":"![2.png](///raw/553/22/z/218c4.png)\n![7.gif](///raw/553/22/z/22367.gif)\n## Fair n Square, the ultimate square shooter?\nTry out your skills in Fair n Square, and see how far you can make it!

His ship broke down and now he's stranded in the middle of an asteroid belt. He needs three components to fix his ship: fuel, a new hyperdrive module, and an asteroid shield. The strange inhabitants of the asteroid belt may have the things he needs, but they come at a high price: his precious oxygen which is already ticking down. Can Bartleby fix his ship and travel home before his air supply runs out? His fate is in your hands.\n\n(I recommend playing the downloaded version so you can play it in a higher resolution, but the WebGL should work too!)\n\n![screen_octo.jpg](///raw/c16/1/z/216a0.jpg)\n\n**Controls** \n\n- Left Mouse Button...........Activate Thrusters\n- Right Mouse Button........Open Map/Inventory \n- Space....................................Interact/Repair Ship\n\nBartleby's space suit is equipped with zero-gravity thrusters. Just hold the mouse button down and Bartleby will rocket away. The further the mouse cursor is from Bartleby, the faster he will accelerate.\n\nBartleby's map is his most valuable asset. It shows key landmarks in the galaxy. Search near the landmarks for characters who want something from Bartleby. If its not in his inventory, they'll also tell him where to find it. Follow the chain of requests to get the items Bartleby needs to fix his ship!\n\nBartleby has ten minutes of oxygen in his tank. If you install one of the key items (fuel, hyperdrive, or shield) into his ship, his oxygen will refill. Use this to stay alive!\n\n![screen_bruce.jpg](///raw/c16/1/z/216a3.jpg)\n\nThis has been my fifth Ludum Dare (fourth time finish), and also my first time streaming my process, which was a lot of fun. I felt really good about how everything went: I had a good scope from the outset, I adapted my initial idea to work with the theme, and I had a lot of fun with the art and writing, which is more my forte than programming. And I didn't work *too* crazy hard, so all in all, one of my best LD experiences!\n\nPlease leave any and all feedback, and if you run into bugs I will try to track them down.

The talent pool isn‚Äôt that deep but you might find an elite or a weapon upgrade worth the investment.\n\nIt‚Äôs not overly clear but there are two types of missions on the job board, *MERCENARY* and *CONTRACT*. With the former, you hire yourself out to an existing crew, but you only get a small cut of the winnings. With the latter, you and your crew take on the whole contract and all the spoils are yours. The contract missions are more difficult though, make sure you hire some fodder to distract the bugs.\n\n#### THEME ####\n\nAs the leader of a band of mercenaries you risk, exchange even, the lives of you and your crew for monetary reward. Your life and theirs are currency in a never ending bug hunt.\n\nAnother interpretation of the theme; money is more important to you than anything in your life.\n\nI'm sure there'll be lots of entries where the theme has been taken quite literally; life force used as a form of currency. I have not.\n\n#### DEVELOPMENT ####\n\nThere‚Äôs quite a bit of stuff I had to strip out of the game, massively over scoped, as always. No music, the force-field upgrade is never available. No terrain or enemy variation unfortunately, but there are three weapons and two different merc characters.\n\nThe game desperately needs some balancing, I didn‚Äôt have time before submission, so apologies if it‚Äôs too easy or too hard. Let me know!\n\nI‚Äôve stuck comments on anonymous so you can trash me all your want, but if you do leave your name I will be happy to play/rate your game in return.\n\nI hope you enjoy the game!\n\n----------------------\n\n*UPDATE 2019-04-29: I fixed a spelling mistake* üò¨ *and a bug where your could walk out of the teleport beam at the end of a mission.*\n\n------------------------","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b1b/8/z/21577.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/mercs","author":{"name":"fazz","uid":35611,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b1b/8/z/4bca.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/fazz"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://fazz.itch.io/mercs"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://fazz.itch.io/mercs"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Remember","category":"compo","description":"![remember01.png](///raw/ffc/2/z/21a28.png)\n\n![remember02.png](///raw/ffc/2/z/21a68.png)\n\n![remember03.png](///raw/ffc/2/z/21a69.png)\n\n**_Remember_** is a simple text-based adventure game where you play as an amnesiac, forced to trade your few remaining memories with other characters in the hope of remembering who you are. Any any stage, simply type in the number of an action to perform it.\n\nEach character has a story to tell, and a memory that will benefit them; when you share it with them, you will gain access to one of their memories in return. Pay careful attention to each character - both to their story and to any descriptive clues - as your overall score will depend on how efficiently you share your memories.\n\n**Recommendation:** I would recommend two playthroughs. For the first, try and achieve the best score possible. For the second, explore some of the other interactions available to you!\n\n\n**N.B.** This game is narrative-heavy, and so text-heavy. As such, I didn't have time to proof-read it all before submitting. If you come across a typo, or anything that seems odd, then please do let me know and I'll endeavour to fix it. Thanks!\n\n**UPDATE - 13/05/19:** Fixed a couple of typos in the text, along with a bug whereby the game would freeze if the text log became too long.

In this super brutal game, instead of betting money, players bet their health. The last one who resists loss of blood wins. The rest probably deserve to lose.\n\nPlayers start the game with 100 health. Each bet, damage and healing is 5 health. A round has 3 betting phases. The first one is mandatory. After the last betting phase, if you bet 5 more health, you can discard a card and draw a new one.\n\nThe player who has the greatest number of cards with the same type wins the round. For example, 1-1-2-1-3 beats 5-2-2-1-3, because that hand contains a combo with a length of 3. If two hands have the same combo length, the combo with higher card value wins (e.g. 1-2-2-4-3 beats 2-1-1-5-4). If there is still a draw, players with lower combo lengths lose their bets. Also, cards don‚Äôt show their effects in this case. If only one player is left in the round, others lose their bets. In short, just try to have the same type of cards.\n\nps. I don't have anything against these player names. I just designed three different ai behaviors and named them this way.\n\n![ssb.png](///raw/e13/8/z/213f3.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e13/8/z/213dc.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/killem","author":{"name":"Aycan","uid":33566,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e13/8/z/4b21.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/aycan"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e13/8/z/212b8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e13/8/z/212b8.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e13/8/z/213f3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e13/8/z/213f3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://github.com/aycansblx/Kill-em"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://aycan.itch.io/killem"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Prospector Stanley","category":"compo","description":"Prospector Stanley heads out west hoping to get rich with a bit of gold mining.

However, every sacrifice will reduce one life, so make sure you'll have some lives in stock!\n\nThe bunnies will turn more yellow (\"golden\") over time, and once they hit the max gold value, they will also give an extra life once dying.\n\n**‚ÄãNote:** ‚ÄãIt's not obvious, but the game ends when you run out of lives, not bunnies.\n\n## Controls:\n- **Arrow keys**: move\n- **Down arrow**: quick fall\n- **Z**: Jump, \"flap\"\n- **Enter**: pause\n\n## Music?\nThere was \"music\" for a short amount of time, but mystically it disappeared!\n\n## Screenshots:\n![5.png](///raw/cb1/z/20e17.png)\n![6.png](///raw/cb1/z/20e1e.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cb1/z/20e14.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/a-burning-rabbit-experiment","author":{"name":"Jani Nykanen","uid":444,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cb1/z/1515b.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/jani-nykanen"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cb1/z/20e16.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cb1/z/20e16.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cb1/z/2107b.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cb1/z/2107b.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cb1/z/20e17.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cb1/z/20e17.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cb1/z/20e1e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cb1/z/20e1e.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://jani-nykanen.itch.io/a-burning-rabbit-experiment"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/jani-nykanen/a-burning-rabbit-experiment"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://gamejolt.com/games/rabbit/411230"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Nuclear Arms 7: Railway to Heaven","category":"jam","description":"![Title7.png](///raw/c45/z/22459.png)\n\n![Nuclear Arms 7 Screenshot 2019.04.29 - 17.16.16.12.png](///raw/c45/z/22469.png)\n\n![clip1.gif](///raw/c45/z/2245d.gif)\n\n![clip2.gif](///raw/c45/z/22470.gif)\n\n![clip3.gif](///raw/c45/z/22485.gif)\n\n![clip5.gif](///raw/c45/z/2248b.gif)\n\nCraig Killbane has run out of energy trying to return home after his fight with the Waste wizard. Lucky for him he was able to hitch a ride on a passing space train. Unfortunately for him, the train is under attack by the Coal Cabal. Killbane will need to the help of the drifters on board the train to help fight off the intruders so he can get back to earth!\n\nAs Craig you'll fight enemies in each train car in order to make it further down the train. There are drifters onboard who are willing to sell you their upgrades as long as you give them some of your energy. Weigh the risk of going for the better upgrades at the cost of your remaining life!\n\n- WASD keys to move\n- Mouse to aim\n- Left click to shoot\n- E to buy upgrades at the shop\n\n- You heal half of your health inbetween each train car from the solar radiation\n- Upgrades are random each playthrough, and stack as well. You may get lucky early on, or you might need to hold out for better upgrades later.\n\nThis game follows the adventures of Craig Killbane. You can check out the previous game in the series in our last Ludum Dare submission here:\n\n[Nuclear Arms 6](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/nuclear-arms-6-waste-wizards-tricks)\n\nOr the entire list of Nuclear Arms games from my profile [here](https://ldjam.com/users/logicon211/)\n\nAnother busy Ludum Dare weekend done. We had the usual crew around for this plus a little extra but this time we have a group logo! We're still trying to stick to genres we haven't done or tried yet. This one sort of threw us for a loop as we had a harder time coming up with an idea that we thought would be too close to our last. However in the end the roguelike style we went with ended up feeling like a much different game.\n\nAs usual we had a lot of fun coming up with Craigs next adventure and what new characters he'll interact with next. We hope you enjoy! And if you can't get enough of Craig we made 6 other games with him in it! Go check it out.\n\nCredits\n\n[@Logan Marks](https://twitter.com/Logicon211) - Programming (Enemies, Bosses, Map, Effects), Sprites/Animations (Enemies), Sound effects/filters, Voice (drifter)\n\n[@Amanda Gallant](https://twitter.com/Kaput33) - Sprites (Enemies, Bosses), Slide Art, Voice (Killjane)\n\n[@Brodie Beaman](https://twitter.com/BrodieBeaman) - Programming (Powerups, HUD, UI Elements), Sprites (UI) Sound Editing \n\n[@Chad Gerein](https://twitter.com/GodTierLuck) - Programming (Enemies, Parallax, Bosses)\n\n[@Mitchell Maclean](https://twitter.com/NachoTrap) - Programming (Player, Powerups, Bosses), Voice (Jingle), Humor Consultant, Game Design\n\n[@Brenden Roach](https://twitter.com/FTL_Sloth) - Story Board, Slide Art, Humor Consultant, Voice(Fossil Fuel)\n\n[@Taylor Seely](https://twitter.com/electricbatman) - Sound Design, Story Board","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c45/z/22330.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/nuclear-arms-7-railway-to-heaven","author":{"name":"Logicon211","uid":1356,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c45/z/4ed1.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/logicon211"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c45/z/22459.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c45/z/22459.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c45/z/22469.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c45/z/22469.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c45/z/2245d.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c45/z/2245d.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c45/z/22470.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c45/z/22470.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c45/z/22485.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c45/z/22485.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c45/z/2248b.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c45/z/2248b.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/Logicon211/LudumDare44"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://bit.ly/2ZLuSIz"},{"label":"macOS","url":"http://bit.ly/2GOl8EH"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://bit.ly/2V12HXz"},{"label":"Other","url":""}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"payblood","category":"compo","description":"the game was made in gamemaker:studio, and i did the music in fl studio 20, sounds were recorded with audacity and mixed in fl studio as well\n\nthe source code  is in the form of a .gmz file since i wasn't sure how else to upload it\n\n![screenshot4.PNG](///raw/b7b/22/z/2141c.png)\n![screenshot2.PNG](///raw/b7b/22/z/2141e.png)\n![screenshot5.PNG](///raw/b7b/22/z/21420.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b7b/22/z/213f8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/payblood","author":{"name":"eyedromeda","uid":142203,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b7b/22/z/2023f.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/eyedromeda"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b7b/22/z/2141c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b7b/22/z/2141c.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b7b/22/z/2141e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b7b/22/z/2141e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b7b/22/z/21420.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b7b/22/z/21420.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://eyedromeda.itch.io/payblood"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://eyedromeda.itch.io/payblood"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"CurANTcy","category":"compo","description":"![demo.gif](///raw/dae/2/z/2193b.gif)\nTry to get an ant to space with a just a quarter and a lot of friends.

You must locate and bring back wrecks from among the asteroids and derelict stations to sustain Humanity and also to fuel your ship. You can also choose to drain the fuel tanks of the wrecks on location if you don't have enough to make it back.

And welcome!\n\nMaintenance Costs is a puzzle game in which you give instructions to your robots. Unfortunatly, robots are pretty exepensive to maintain, and greatest economists of the world say that it would be more efficient to avoid maintenance costs. \n\nKeep your focus on two things: achieving level objectives and letting go the old robots that hold you back.\n\nDifficulty level only change the amount of money you get when you start the game. More money, more place for errors.\n\n### This game is difficult.\nSeriously, I didn't want to make it that hard, but it is. Some tools were created to help you:\n - In-game help: enable it on the launch screen (enabled by default, recommended).\n - In-game tooltips: if you don't understand what something means (UI or tile), there is probably a tooltip linked to it. Place your cursor over it and see a message box appear at the top of the screen.\n - In this description (\"More about game mechanics\"), you get advanced explaination about the programmation mechanic (I suggest you try the game first; read this section if you don't understand how to play)\n - There is a walkthrough page to help you if you get stuck in a level at http://nathanistace.be/ludumdare/44/walkthrough/\n\n### Changelog\nI provide two links to the game, the original version and a fixed version. Original version is working correctly, but fixed version gives better comfort, without changing the gameplay.\n\nAdded in the fixed version (you are not rating this):\n - Fixed a visual bug that would show the level on the menu scene\n - Lowered the default volume of some sfx\n - Cheat code: in game, type \"money\" to get +$1000 (\"But... Isn't that a way to avoid the theme?\" \"Well if you need to restart the game you lose time, you lose parts of your life, and time is money. So we could say that this cheatcode is actually more in the theme than anything else in the game!\")\n - Cheat code: in game, type lvl# where # is 0-9 to jump to another level.\n - Walkthrough page\n\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\n### More about game mechanics\nIf you get stuck and can't understand how the game works, here is a more complete explaination than the one you can find in game. If you didn't start the game yet, you should start it and give it a try before reading this.\n \n![Sans titre 3.png](///raw/46b/d1/z/21d35.png)\n\nConditions work as a IF .. ELSE IF .. ELSE.

The mint will make coins automatically as long as the machines are in good shape: raw metal is delivered in one side, coins leave on the other.\n\nKeep an eye on the \"coins per minute\" indicator. If it falls to zero, it is game over for you!\n\nControl the minter (your character, the green thing on the screen) with the arrow keys or WASD. Execute actions with Control, Enter or the space bar (they are all the same; this game uses a single \"action\" command).\n\n*Machines:* Machines decay naturally as the time passes and sometimes they just break. You can fix them using tools. The worse the machine state, the slower it will send the mintage to the next stage in the production pipeline.\n\n*Tools:* You fix machines using tools. You start with a wrench, which never breaks but is not really a good tool. You can buy other tools which are faster to fix things up but have a chance of breaking upon use. Buying a tool will reduce your \"coins per minute\" for some time. You can get your tools at your office.\n\n*Visitors:* The mint has a nice museum by the reception area. Visitors are blue and are welcome. Too bad, sometimes visitors get curious and decide to wander through the forbidden areas of the mint. Don't let them do that! These areas are dangerous, and an injured visitor will cost you some \"coins per minute\" as restitution. And let's not even think about how much would cost of a visitor lost his life in a mint accident!\n\n*Thieves:* Since Money Heist (La Casa de Papel) aired, the number of red-clothed people trying to steal money from mints has skyrocketed. Expect some of them.\n\n*Weapons:* They work are just like tools, but can be used to kill thieves and to convince rogue visitors to go back home. Avoid hitting visitors too hard, you don't want them dead!\n\n\n**Technical detals**\n\n* Engine: [Godot](http://godotengine.org) 3.1.1.\n* Graphics: [Krita](https://krita.org).\n* Font: [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com), by ≈Åukasz Dziedzic.\n* Audio: Some effects recorded by myself, some generated by [jfxr](https://jfxr.frozenfractal.com), edited with [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org).\n* Music: A Kazoo reinterpretation of a Pink Floyd classic, which I called *Short of Money*.

Manage your happiness, money and vitality and reach your dreams!\n\n# How to play?\n\n![GameDevLife.960x600.20190501134154440.png](///raw/e4e/z/2417e.png)\n\n## Goal\n\nYou are a boy that wanna be game developer. Your goal could be reach your dreams, become rich, being happy or get older (or maybe a mix of all of them, it is possible!!!). Also, you can play to discover several ways to die :P.\n\nGame ends when you spend all your life and die (it could take about 2-3 minutes if you get that far in the game). Then the game will show you a summary of your life.\n\n![GameDevLife.960x600.20190501134111868.png](///raw/e4e/z/2417d.png)\n\n## Game flow\n\nEvery month you can make an action. **All actions take a cost of life**, and will change your life state. You have 3 game indicators that will give you all the information that you need for knowing the progress in your life.\n\n### Life\n\nIt's the most basic parameter. **When life is over you die**.\n\n### Happiness\n\nMost of the actions you make affects to your happiness. If this bar is over your life cost of your actions will be increased dramatically. **Be sure you take a break every now and then ;)**.\n\n### Money\n\nGet fun costs money. Get independent cost soo much money. **Living is not free!** If your money is negative you will start to lose your Happiness.\n\n## Actions\n\nActions (or decisions) are divided in 3 sections that you can navigate clicking the gray buttons. If you put the cursor over an action, a panel in the right will show you the immediate consequencies of that action.\n\n### Fun\n\n![GameDevLife.960x600.20190501134315087.png](///raw/e4e/z/2417f.png)\n\nIt will improve your happiness. At the beginning your only action is \"Play\", but you will get more ways to get fun in the future!\n\n### Study\n\n![GameDevLife.960x600.20190501134214995.png](///raw/e4e/z/24181.png)\n\nLearning is essential to get a job. As in real life, the most of the early years you will have to learn the basic stuff (General learnings). After that you could start to study about your vocation: videogames.\n\n### Work\n\n![GameDevLife.960x600.20190501132818326.png](///raw/e4e/z/24182.png)\n\nWhen you have basic learnings you can have a crap job and earn some money. If you abandon your dreams, you can get experience and apply to better jobs. Maybe it could be easier being happy and rich! Else, **your first jobs in the videogames industry will be unpaid**. You must work as internship or make free jobs before you can become a game developer. Nobody said reaching your dreams was easy!\n\n**NOTE:** There are a lot of jobs that you could unlock studying and working. For example, if you get experience as programmer and artist, you could work as technical artist. Even, if you work hard, **you will be able to found your own big videogames company!!!**\n\n### Special action: become independent\n\n![GameDevLife.960x600.20190501135258668.png](///raw/e4e/z/24184.png)\n\nWhen you are 18 years old you feel that you need your space. **If you get independent, you will spend $1,000 per month, but if you stay at your parents home you will be less happy every month**. Become independent as soon as you have a paid job!","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e4e/z/21655.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/game-dev-life","author":{"name":"Neowedge","uid":3662,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e4e/z/bf63.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/neowedge"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e4e/z/2417e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e4e/z/2417e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e4e/z/2417d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e4e/z/2417d.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e4e/z/2417f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e4e/z/2417f.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e4e/z/24181.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e4e/z/24181.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e4e/z/24182.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e4e/z/24182.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e4e/z/24184.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e4e/z/24184.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://gitlab.com/neowedge/game-dev-life/-/archive/ld-44/game-dev-life-ld-44.zip"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://neowedge.itch.io/game-dev-life"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Remember","category":"jam","description":"Experience the life of a struggling single father in a world where your memories are currency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate:\n\n-Fixed a bug where you could walk around in the second section of the game\n\n-Significantly reduced the amount of flashing lights in the flashback sequence (sorry if that caused issues for anyone)\n\n-Fixed an issue where the text was often unreadable by changing it's color to be more blue","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ef9/52/z/22f9e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/remember-1","author":{"name":"Elijah Moreno","uid":154110,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/elijah-moreno"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://elijah-moreno.itch.io/remember"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Greendy","category":"compo","description":"üëá**Brief instructions**üëá If you find out some *critical bug*, please leave a comment.

Trading might seem very confusing, so here are a few tips:\n\n- You'll want to use the ships you control to collect different currencies from different traders to generate *doubloons*. Cursed ships (those that you control) **convert other currencies** to doubloons as soon as all currencies are present in their inventory.\n\n- Be wary of how much of one currency you accumulate and of how much doubloons you spend, since if your *doubloons* lose their dominant status on the ship, the curse will lift and you will lose the ship.\n\n- There is no RNG, all prices are dynamically calculated under set rates based on country demands. Try to speculate on various offers of the seas to maximize profit.\n\n**Changes**\n\n[04/28/2019] - Fixed UI sizing for HTML, changed Unicode character for Ranc currency, fixed typos in Country declaration\n\n[04/28/2019] - Fixed typos in Country conversion\n\n[04/29/2019] - Fixed typos, added quality option for HTML build, fixed conversion issue, lowered audio","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e42/z/21beb.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/double-deal","author":{"name":"PowerSpark","uid":590,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e42/z/f1f8.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/powerspark"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e42/z/21c1e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e42/z/21c1e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e42/z/21b0f.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e42/z/21b0f.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://powerspark.itch.io/double-deal"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://powerspark.itch.io/double-deal"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://powerspark.itch.io/double-deal"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://powerspark.itch.io/double-deal"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://www.mediafire.com/file/xlb9x93f8myqfl3/Ludum_Dare_44_Source.zip/file"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Dungeon of the Blood God","category":"jam","description":"![title.gif](///raw/924/e/z/21bb2.gif)\n\nEnter the Dungeon of the Blood God in search of riches.

Each type of asteroid carries a kind of resource necessary for life.  However, life is fragile!  In order for it to develop, you need to provide your planet with exactly the right resources, by diverting asteroids away or towards the planet.\n\nComplete the current \"recipe\" to produce more biomass.  When you reach enough biomass, your life forms will grow to the next stage, requiring different resources.  Be careful though!  If an asteroid not required hits the planet, it will cause a small-scale extinction, which reduces your biomass.  In the worst case, this might throw you back to a more primitive life form.\n\n## Controls\n\n‚ÄãClick and drag on an asteroid to move it.  It works like a rubber band: stretch in a direction, then release to send the asteroid flying the opposite way.\n\nThe menu on the left shows:\n\n- On top: your total biomass\n- Below that (in white): the current \"recipe\" for life that you need to fulfill.  Each asteroid remaining is half-transparent.  Asteroids that have already been collected are full coloured.  The number \"+xxx\" indicates the amount of biomass gained by completing that recipe.‚Äã\n- At the bottom (in red): the next \"recipe\" for life, that will be unlocked when your total biomass is at least equal to the number at the bottom of the recipe.\n\nThis game is best played on a touch screen, in landscape mode.  Try\nit on your convertible laptop, your smartphone or your tablet.‚Äã\n\n## End Game\n\nThere is no upper limit to your biomass, but you lose if you ever reach 0.

They'll appear in italics.\n* *Fatigue will not reset if you restart the level after losing it because of exhaustion.*\n* *The End level popup earnings texts are misaligned.*\n* *Game Beaten popup not showing after level 3.

Drag and drop resources into the middle to use them.\n\n**The Theme:**\n\nI wanted to take a different twist on the theme to the one I anticipated most people would do.

This game was created from scratch for LD, including all assets and music.\n\nIf you encounter any problems, or just for a general chat, drop by the #ludumdare IRC channel on afternet.org!\n\nI used the following tools and libraries to make this:\n* Tools: text editor, Audacity, Logic Pro X, Pixilart.com (sprite editor), Gimp\n* PIXI.js (a HTML5 canvas library)\n* Howler.js (for audio)\n\nI made this game mainly on my new Linux workstation, except for the music (because of Logic Pro) :smile: \n\n## How to Play\n\n* You can play with mouse or keyboard.\n* Num Pad or Arrow keys to move, attack, or interact\n* Most actions cost you hit points\n* Attacks work by subtracting the hit points of each participant from the opponent\n* R restarts the level\n* Tab switches between characters\n* Special abilities are explained in the sidebar\n* There are 10 short levels\n* You must get one character to the exit in order to complete a level\n* \"Cheesing it\" is allowed and encouraged\n\n## Random Notes\n\n* There is no upgrade mechanic, you get all the abilities from the start and XP is basically just for high score (because I couldn't come up with a dungeon design that wouldn't screw people over who upgraded \"wrong\")\n* You'll see how well the other players did on a given level on the level end screens\n* It should work in most modern browsers, but I tested on Chrome/Chromium only. Frame rates on Firefox will most likely suck, but it should be playable.\n\n## Post LD Patch Notes\n\n* Changed the XP stats to show percentages instead of number of participants\n\n![ld44-screen1.jpg](///raw/2cb/z/2322d.jpg)\n\n## Videos\n* Elysia Griffin plays Dungeon Buddies: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/421751050?t=03h21m43s\n* MrJoshuaMcLean plays Dungeon Buddies: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/419497157?t=10h14m19s","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2cb/z/23133.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/dungeon-buddies","author":{"name":"udo","uid":3010,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2cb/z/f033.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/udo"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2cb/z/2322d.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2cb/z/2322d.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://openfu.com/dev/ld/ld44/game/"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://openfu.com/dev/ld/ld44/game.zip"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://openfu.com/dev/ld/ld44/bin/LD44-DungeonBuddies-win64.zip"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://openfu.com/dev/ld/ld44/bin/LD44-DungeonBuddies-osx64.tgz"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://openfu.com/dev/ld/ld44/bin/LD44-DungeonBuddies-linux64.tgz"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Money Mafia","category":"jam","description":"Take on the role of Tony \"Two Cents\" Ricci and defend your family's laundromat from a mob of unruly gangsters in classic 1930's mobster fashion!\n\n## CONTROLS\n\n> WASD - movement\n\n> CLICK - shoot\n\n> E - discard weapon\n\n> R - restart\n\n**Ammo is finite, so be careful with your bullets!** You will have to pick up new guns when you are out of ammo.\n\n![cover.png](///raw/7e5/z/23b6b.png)\n\n![game1.PNG](///raw/7e5/z/23664.png)\n\n![game2.PNG](///raw/7e5/z/2366c.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7e5/z/23487.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/money-mafia","author":{"name":"miltage","uid":1511,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7e5/z/23e71.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/miltage"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7e5/z/23b6b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7e5/z/23b6b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7e5/z/23664.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7e5/z/23664.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7e5/z/2366c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//7e5/z/2366c.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://github.com/Miltage/LD44"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://miltage.itch.io/money-mafia"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://miltage.itch.io/money-mafia"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Deadly Dungeon","category":"jam","description":"![ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif](///raw/824/3/z/246fe.gif)\n\n![Minigames_sc.png](///raw/824/3/z/24701.png)\n\n\nDeadly dungeon with demon lord.

You work for a big organization that has a long history of money printing with a small twist to it. Your money is made of real presidents that become the figureheads once the procedure is done. It's your job to deliver those presidents and print this special money.\n\n## Gameplay\nIn \"Bill Hunter\" you can play 3 missions, each on a different difficulty level. In each mission, you are given a list of targets and see how they look like in the upper right corner of the screen. The targets are random mash-ups of features from multiple presidents and look different every time you play the level. The targets are somewhere inside a crowd of people. For some reason, everyone in this crowd looks almost exactly as the targets you are looking for. Differences may only lie in a single feature like outfit, hair, face, beard or accessories. Who knows... maybe there is some kind of presidential cosplay event around.\n\nOnce you found a target and are certain of them being the real one, you can kidnap them. However, be careful of other people seeing you. If a person witnesses your act, they will flee from the area and escape. If you don't watch out, another one of your targets might escape before you even have the chance of encountering them.\n\nIf all targets are either kidnapped or did escape, or the time limit is reached, you will return to your organization, and do what your organization has practiced for over dozens of centuries now.\n\n## Controls\nInformation about controls is accessible from the game's menu.\n\n## Technical Details\n* The game was made in Unity 2D\n* All sounds and graphics were made by ourselves\n\n![Money Press - large.png](///raw/921/31/z/222c0.png)\n\n![Banner simple - large.png](///raw/921/31/z/222ec.png)\n\n![Screen Shot 1 - small.png](///raw/921/31/z/23da3.png)\n\n![Gif 3.gif](///raw/921/31/z/229d7.gif)\n\n![Gif 2.gif](///raw/921/31/z/229df.gif)\n\n![Gif 4.gif](///raw/921/31/z/229e8.gif)\n\n![Banner simple - large.png](///raw/921/31/z/222ec.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//921/31/z/22586.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/bill-hunter","author":{"name":"Andreas Roschal","uid":78121,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//921/31/z/f0c8.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/andreas-roschal"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//921/31/z/222ec.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//921/31/z/222ec.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//921/31/z/225a1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//921/31/z/225a1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//921/31/z/222bf.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//921/31/z/222bf.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//921/31/z/222c0.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//921/31/z/222c0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//921/31/z/222ec.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//921/31/z/222ec.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//921/31/z/23da3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//921/31/z/23da3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//921/31/z/229d7.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//921/31/z/229d7.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//921/31/z/229df.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//921/31/z/229df.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//921/31/z/229e8.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//921/31/z/229e8.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//921/31/z/222ec.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//921/31/z/222ec.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://andreasroschal.itch.io/bill-hunter"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://andreasroschal.itch.io/bill-hunter"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Tunnel Bug","category":"compo","description":"![LD44-00006.gif](///raw/c4a/z/21437.gif)\n\nTravel through the tunnels before the bug's health reaches zero.

So do we! Therefore we increased the size of the target laser pointer.\n - To compare scores with others, we also included your bounty in both end screens, not just when you die. **(Post your scores in the comments by the way. We would love to know how well you did!)**\n - The camera now rotates more intuitively and you are even able to rotate it by pressing Q/E\n - Improved the UI by simplifying text and buttons\n- 1.0.6\n - Relocated huge bounty UI element, that was blocking the view. He just had a big ego\n - Play sounds now when and where they should play, and not before their time has come\n- 1.0.5\n - Fix Laser Pointer hiding behind trees.

Real close. None of this \"Oh the hitbox should be larger\" nonsense. **Jez tip: If there's no one else playing, open a new window/tab and fight against the idle fighter. Or invite a friend!**\n- Watch people move around and be part of the HUSTLE AND BUSTLE of the financial district.\n- Participate in NON-VERBAL FINANCIAL INTERACTION with your fellow businesspeople.\n\n### :boom: BATTLE PHASE\n- During the BATTLE PHASE, fighters are given a chance to invest in other fighter's stocks and gain a COMPETITIVE EDGE.\n- Fighters need to buy and sell stocks to meet their AGGRESSIVE PROFIT QUOTAS. You must end with more assets than you started with!\n- Due to INSIDER TRADING LAWS the other fighter DOES NOT PARTAKE in during the trading battle. Victory is YOURS FOR THE TAKING.\n- Are you COOPERATING or COMPETING with your fellow fighter? Who can tell?\n- Winning the financial battle will give you a 49% SHARE of your opponent's assets. Your opponent doesn't lose anything though? Sounds like a GOOD DEAL TO ME.\n- Added winning bonus: Gain LUCRATIVE STOCKS that generate dividend money while you sit there!\n- Losing will HALF FINANCIAL QUARTER your total money! By which we mean losing will make you lose half your money.\n\n## :question: *The mystery name*\n- Every player gets their own name but they don't know what it is! Only by climbing the ranks of the HIGHSCORE TABLE and by PROCESS OF ELIMINATION can you discover your TRUE IDENTITY\n\n## :two_men_holding_hands: TEAM UP WITH A FRIEND\n- Insider trading NEVER LOOKED SO GREAT!

There is no any save mechanism so you have to be carefull while you are dealing with the enemies. You have a soul value. Actually soul value is representing your hit point and also your souls is your currency so you can buy upgrades with them but you have to be carefull.\n\n**CONTROLS**: WASD to MOVE | R for actions\n\n**TOOLS I USED**\n\nHTML5/Javascript with Phaser V2\n\nAseprite & Photoshop\n\nRytmik Studio \n\nSFXR\n\n[twitter.com/obsfx](https://twitter.com/obsfx)\n\n[Play On Browser](https://obsfx.github.io/games/jams/ld44_dangerinthesnow/)\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//39b/71/z/21acc.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/danger-in-the-snow","author":{"name":"omercanbalandi","uid":97171,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//39b/71/z/250e3.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/omercanbalandi"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//39b/71/z/2191c.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//39b/71/z/2191c.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//39b/71/z/219df.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//39b/71/z/219df.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//39b/71/z/2191e.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//39b/71/z/2191e.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//39b/71/z/21921.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//39b/71/z/21921.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//39b/71/z/21924.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//39b/71/z/21924.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//39b/71/z/21927.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//39b/71/z/21927.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/obsfx/ld44-danger-in-the-snow"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://obsfx.github.io/games/jams/ld44_dangerinthesnow/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"99Hearts","category":"jam","description":"![ezgif.com-gif-maker (1).gif](///raw/09f/61/z/21c3f.gif)\n\n\n\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nYou are building the world around you by laying down the rooms in the world.

Run faster, jump farther, teleport through walls -- if you don't succumb to radiation poisoning first.\n\n![hs.png](///raw/8d0/41/z/2450c.png)\n\nThe game includes a crappy built-in tutorial, but here are some directions:\n* Left/right arrow to move, Z to jump, X to use special abilities.\n* Hold Shift to see names and descriptions of all of your genes.\n* The more uranium you carry, the more genes you have, and the higher up you go, the faster you'll lose genes.\n* Time is paused when you're in a checkpoint/shop area. Use them to take a breather.\n* There are 12 different genes to find. Catch 'em all!\n\nThis was an exciting one, despite the theme! The more I stared at it, the more I became convinced that it's basically a subset of the last theme. I ended up looking to the other final-round themes for inspiration, but still found a way to incorporate \"your life is currency\"... at least I think I did. I suppose you'll be the judge. I was determined to make a more actiony game since my last three have been word-based, but it meant straying way outside my artistic comfort zone. The art took a ton of time. I don't even remember writing the music. The code was no walk in the park either... it really came down to the wire! I went 30+ hours without sleep at the end, and it was worth it. I learned new stuff and made a genre of game I've never made before.\n\nDone in Unity/C#. Also used Photoshop, Illustrator, FL Studio, and Audacity. Font is Umba Soft by Anita J√ºrgeleit.\n\n**KNOWN ISSUES**\n* It's definitely possible to become unable to progress due to lack of genes or misaligned map chunks. I can try to fix it if you post a screenshot.\n* The balance is pretty poor, in general.

In order to play a card from your hand you sacrifice the same amount of life from\nyour own total.\n\nATTACK\nThe green number on the bottom left of your card is its attack value. When you attack your opponent's cards or his health core, this is the amount of damage the card does. If your card is attacked by your opponent, it will defend itself, causing damage to the attacking card as well.\n\nCOOLDOWN\nEvery card has a cooldown, indicated by the timer symbol on the top left. As long as a card is in cooldown, it remains tabbed. On your next turn, your cards' cooldowns are decreased by one.\n\nLIFESTEAL\nSome cards posses the power to steal life, indicated by a red blood droplet in the top right. Any damage dealt by a card with lifesteal is added to your health pool, allowing you to regenerate.\n\nADDITIONAL DRAWS\nSome cards - when played from your hand - allow you to draw an extra card.\nThis is indicated by an image of a blank card in the top right.\n\nCONTROLS\nYou can exit the game at any time by pressing Escape.\nTo view a larger version of your card, hover over a card and keep your right mouse button down.\n\n\n\n\n\nCat'sn'Wheels Studios\n\nMade with ‚ù§Ô∏é  using Unity, Blender, Krita, GIMP, Audacity and VS2019\n\ntextures.com - freesound.org - bensound.com","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//045/z/225cd.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/dealing-with-life","author":{"name":"klausklapper","uid":1344,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//045/z/20800.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/klausklapper"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//045/z/23b61.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//045/z/23b61.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://klausklapper.itch.io/dealing-with-life"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Peepo's Parlour","category":"jam","description":"Hello!

It was made in the last 8 hours, and some stuff like tutorial or highscores were roughly bodged together, and it lacks sounds and decent graphics. But, the core gameplay is all there. Entrance barrier may be a bit higher, so be prepared please.\n\n---\n\n # If you don't like reading walls of texts, play in your browser [now](https://boltkey.cz/pyramid_rise/)!\n\n---\n\n![cover.png](///raw/194/z/21966.png)\n\nTake role of an elder pharaoh, preparing for his death by building a pyramid for himself. In other words, tell thousands of your slaves to build it for you.\n\nBuild the pyramid from blocks as they arrive from the mines. Try to make areas of same symbols. Will you cash out early, or will you build your epic combo at risk of getting nothing at all in the end?\n\n## Controls\n\n * Click above your pyramid to place blocks\n\n * Right click to swap symbols on the selected block\n\n * Click inside your pyramid to cash your blocks\n\n * Press 1-4 to select different blocks to place\n\n * Press P to restart\n\n## Gameplay\n\nStart off by joining together blocks of same color. If you click on a group, you cash it.\n\nThe amount of money earned is the triangular number of number of symbols in one group.\n\n| Number of symbols | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | ... |\n|-------------------|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|-----|\n| Money gained      | 1 | 3 | 6 | 10 | 15 | 21 | 28 | ... |\n\nIn this example, I am going to earn 6 money after clicking the group of 3 green blocks.\n\n![screen1.png](///raw/194/z/218a8.png)\n\nOnce you have money, you can (and should) use it to open and upgrade mines. There are 4 mines total, and at start you only have 1 active.\n\nIf you manage to place all the blocks from all the mines and finish the pyramid, you win. Your final score is the total money earned throughout the game + money left at the end + remaining time (in seconds). Try and hunt for the top spots!\n\n---\n\n*\"BoltKey! But what does this game have to do with the theme?\"*\n\nGood question fellow jammer! My first idea was trading slaves. Each one had some skillset, and you had to carefully sell and buy slaves in order to earn the most. I started with about 17 hours to go and spent about 8 hours on it.\n\nI completely lost the vision. I didn't know how to finish it. I overscoped.\n\nBut the other theme about slaves was pyramid building. I was thinking of some system where you have slaves that work in the mines, slaves that transport the stones and slaves that actually build the pyramid. You would buy and sell slaves of each specialization as needed.\n\nI could not see that coming together in 8 hours.\n\nSo I ended up with just the theme of building a pyramid. I made a simple fast puzzle concept, had it completely prepared, and put it together in those last 8 horus.\n\nThanks for reading!

Holding Left Click with the sword will cause it to Swing back and forth while clicking right click will cause you to do a powerful jab. \nThe gun's bullets can bounce and will not be noticed by surronding enemies, making it a very good tool for silent takedowns, it is not advised you run and gun because the gun has a mildly high cooldown time. Both weapons will only drop coins when killing an enemy\n\nBy pressing \"E\", Killbi will start to do a sucking motion, pulling every enemy in the cone towards him. By letting of of \"E\", Killbi chops down and kills only one enemy wthin choping range. This awards Killbi with the same amount of health the enemy had. \n\nYou can go into the \"Buy\" menu by pressing \"B\", to exit out of it you just press \"esc\". Inside you can buy upgrades, abilities, and one-use powerups with your health and coins. To do spoil the fun, you can go and test out what each upgrade does for yourself!","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b9b/71/z/219de.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/killbi","author":{"name":"HEXIEZ123","uid":97179,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/hexiez123"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XU1veC5_lOWxJm-47QPv6hhTb7HF0pnC/view?usp=sharing"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1koyvLt77yZSphoS5PF5OYNwozHXbM40b/view?usp=sharing"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iEfmqrguBii4Sm71OyV0Tqd7RydlXKTM/view?usp=sharing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"EndlessRum","category":"jam","description":"Check the Itch.io page to play the game\n\nEndlessRum is a pirate adventure game.

If you're fit to make the cut, fire up the engine on your sanguine screamer and get ready to tear it up! Can you reach the end of this dangerous track, or are you going to be left in the dust?\n\nOut here, your blood is the only thing worth anything, which is lucky for you: your ride runs on high octane blood, so if you start to run low you know where to get that from - yourself! Just pump the brakes and start bloodletting and you'll be fueled back up in no time! Burn that extra blood with the turbo boost and blast ahead for the quickest time! If you don't feel like fueling up from yourself, take it from the road. There are gallons of blood just waiting for you - from cauldrons, goblets, or even those labcoats working the local blood drive.\n\nYou aren't the only thing on the road; you didn't think it'd be easy did you? The rough road is covered in obstacles that'll slow you down and drain your health, so stay on the straight and narrow and slow down to make those tight turns. It looks like the Ghostly Ghouls want to put a stop to your fun - run them off the road before they scrap you and take their blood! Don't worry though, if you run out of blood you can always pump the brakes and push the needle to fill back up!\n\nSo, it's quite simple really: race to the end, boil that extra blood with your boost, brake to fuel back up, and take what you need to get the edge. When you've reached the end of the gauntlet, send in your time so we can know if you're Top Blood Mage or just another burnout!\n\n![ezgif-3-6fba4ec7bcff.gif](///raw/817/z/238c7.gif)\n\n# CONTROLS\n## WASD, Arrow Keys, or Numpad\n\n**LEFT**  - A, ‚Üê, 4\n\n**RIGHT** - D, ‚Üí, 6\n\n**BOOST** - W, ‚Üë, 8\n\n**BRAKE** - S, ‚Üì, 5\n\n**PAUSE** - Esc\n\n![ezgif-3-ecd8a750c669.gif](///raw/817/z/238c6.gif)\n\n# Tips:\n\n- Bloodletting slows you down. Keep yourself topped off from the track!\n\n- Boost when you will have extra fuel - it'll speed you up. Be careful, you'll lose your handling if you go too fast.\n\n- Your blood drains quickly, especially while boosting. Make sure you collect extra blood on the course to reduce the amount of time refueling and maximize your boost!\n\n- Tight corners and precarious obstacles require good handling - slow down to make sure you stay on the road!\n\n- The shoulder and barriers of the road really slow you down and drain your blood - keep control of your ride!\n\n- The Ghostly Ghouls seem tough, but if you can knock them into a wall you'll take all their fuel for yourself! Try hitting them near edges or as you round corners to turn them into scrap metal.\n\nEnjoy the ride, and don't get drained!\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//817/z/240a0.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/life-in-the-fast-vein","author":{"name":"Dorblin7z7","uid":6236,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c58/1/z/ef09.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/dorblin7z7"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//817/z/240a0.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//817/z/240a0.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//817/z/238c7.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//817/z/238c7.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//817/z/238c6.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//817/z/238c6.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/DevinPentecost/ld44"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://xhg.itch.io/ld44"},{"label":"web","url":"http://chilidog.faith/lb/ld44"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"A day at the farm","category":"compo","description":"Game Info:\nA day at the farm is a survivor farming game, you are farming Blood Flowers, the only way to get seed for this flower is to buy it for your local vampire shop.

It often starts with a little too much momentum into the wrong direction and before you know it, your stuck in that routine. Getting out is really hard but the best thing to do is just to steer clear once the momentum starts building up.\n\n## Gameplay\nYou task is simple. Don't build up too much momentum into the wrong direction (right) and always keep track if good financial‚Äã goals. Also don't forget to stop and smell the roses (I put in a few inscriptions to lighten the mood).‚Äã\n\n\n## Instructions\n\"A\" and \"D\" to move left and right\n\"Space\" to jump\n\n## From the creator\nAs I stared at the theme I only saw three words: your, life, and currency. I guess it's mainly due to the big steps I recently took in life and it started when I quit my job.\n\nFrom that first day I started looking at things differently. Mainly realizing what was important to me and what wasn't... Forgotten friends resurfaced. Bad habits become nonsensical. Shallow relationships grew sour. Expensive restaurants were boring.\n\nThree years later, I'm in different country (ZA->CA), different career (webdev->gamedev), different outlook (materialistic->frugal), and happier than ever.

My artistic and musical skills are a bit lacking, but I hope you all can enjoy the game I produced anyways! \n\n![Capture3.PNG](///raw/27e/11/z/20ff4.png)\n\nRules:\n0. The goal of the game is to sell Lemonade (and later, hotdogs and icecreams)\n1. Play cards by dragging them onto the brown area (\"the stand\")\n2. You pay for playing cards with health (red) and energy (green)\n3. If you don't have customers you can't play cards that require customers.\n4. Each turn you will recover 2 energy and draw a new hand of 3 cards. \n5. The day ends if you end your turn with 0 customers\n6. After the day ends you get to add 2 cards to your deck by paying a certain amount of health\n7. Try to keep a high score each day to keep your customers happy! :)\n\nBesides that, a couple things to keep in mind:\n1. Customers will start leaving faster each day\n2. Red circles mean a health cost, green circles are the energy cost\n3. Lemonades grant 1 base score, hotdogs 2 and icecreams 3\n4. It's not extremely balanced. I decided it would be better to make the game a bit more rounded instead\n5.

I'm glad you're enjoying it. I thought I'd clear up a few things:\n- Some of you thought it was too easy to reach the ladder sometimes and that it might be an issue with algorithm. This is actually intentional. By taking the ladder as soon as you find it, you miss the opportunity to spend your remaining time at shops to make later levels easier.\n- Yes, one of the shop's options are overpowered. Some of you figured that out and others didn't, but I left it in for this compo because it looks like both groups of players had fun either way. If you'd like a more challenging and balanced run. Avoid using the grey crystal powerup (the one that halves your damage and gives you extra seconds).\n- Yes, the combat is slow and a little clunky. *Tip: Attack a little early and don't spam; the attack's hitbox only appears on certain frames of the animation.* It's not a core mechanic so if you're not enjoying it, you can absolutely skip it by running past enemies.\n\nIn the interest of fairness, I will not update or add any features during the voting period, and that includes balancing. However, if there are any game breaking bugs that prevent you from continuing, then I will fix those. If you happen to find such a bug, I'd be happy for you to include it in a comment, detailing what happened and how you produced the issue.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//622/9/z/21829.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/flash-dash-dungeon","author":{"name":"Raymoclaus","uid":37414,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//622/9/z/80cb.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/raymoclaus"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//622/9/z/21857.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//622/9/z/21857.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://raymoclaus.itch.io/flash-dash-dungeon"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/Raymoclaus/ld44"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Sapling","category":"jam","description":"Click to plant trees.

At least 1 boss was planned, but only the main gameplay loop exists and it continues indefinitely. \n* I've implemented stages of 4 levels each. This doesn't yet affect the gameplay (besides random \"maps\" after stage 0)\n* Ideally I wanted 1 miniboss/hard level per stage and the boss on the 4th+. Of course, each stage with changing background visuals too (..making 1 was difficult enough though).\n* The 'Health/currency' system was supposed to be more robust, involving hp->scrap->upgrades, inventory, modules and on-the-fly repairs. It ended up being a lame direct hp cost.\n* The shop is particularly hacked and rushed.\n* Obviously not as balanced as it could be.\n* No sound at all. I had some cool ideas but alas, time.\n* I don't know why I went for this specific design of 'tank'. I think my brain had an image of a huge tracked vehicle chugging through the desert. Somehow that translated into WWI tanks.\n* The whole idea kind of flopped. The core mechanics are... what even are they? I need to work on my game design! \n* Despite this, there's something about this I feel very fond about but I can't seem to put my finger on it. Might be worth revisiting.\n* I was going for something kind of like the Android game 'Minute Quest'.\n* 30 minutes later: Yeah I was going for a roguelite (you can tell by the existence of a pre-game intro), but decided to hack it into a 'grinding game' after seeing the clock. Still missing some features for that though.\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//bf7/d1/z/21ae5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/martian-scrapper","author":{"name":"Aileron","uid":120827,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//bf7/d1/z/1b17f.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/aileron"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//bf7/d1/z/21d29.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//bf7/d1/z/21d29.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//bf7/d1/z/21d21.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//bf7/d1/z/21d21.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//bf7/d1/z/21d9d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//bf7/d1/z/21d9d.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GAyym4GNZvGyHxHV-OszxonSu_uOF9Ou"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/Aileron-1/LD44"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://xelestial.itch.io/martian-scrapper-ld44"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"We Live in a Society","category":"compo","description":"We Live in a Society is a 2D story game taking you through the life of an office worker who faces many hardships that ultimately lead to his suicide.\n\nThis is a game I made in 48 hours, I would have loved to have had the time to make music and sound effects but I ran out of time. \n\nCheck out my portfolio, https://samuelarminana.com/\n\nLet me know your feedback!!\n\n![1.png](///raw/973/z/21b5e.png)\n![2.png](///raw/973/z/21b5f.png)![3.png](///raw/973/z/21b60.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//973/z/21b5c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/we-live-in-a-society","author":{"name":"1samuel411","uid":889,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/1samuel411"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//973/z/21b5e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//973/z/21b5e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//973/z/21b5f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//973/z/21b5f.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//973/z/21b60.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//973/z/21b60.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/1samuel411/LudumDare44"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://samuelarminana.com/games/ld44/windows.zip"},{"label":"Other","url":"https://1samuel411.itch.io/we-live-in-a-society"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/xtao9h3x3905414/windows.zip?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Lunch Lord","category":"jam","description":"You THOUGHT you stole a cookbook.

Close your door, lock your latch, lest your life and soul he will snatch.\n \nYOU are the Kindercatch and your life comes at a cost... the cost of innocence. In order to keep the bargain for your dark soul, you must catch and dispatch as many little souls as possible. However, it may not be as easy as you would think, they can be... sneaky.\n\nHow To Play: A/D or Arrow Keys to move left/right, W or Up Arrow to float, and Space to Slash. Hunt the children, while avoiding the dogs. You float, don't fly. Just tap 'W' or 'Up' to stay adrift, you will come down automatically.\n\nGame Tip: Children are hard to catch near their homes, stalk them from the air and catch them away from their house. Houses are also dangerous, children are more likely to release their dogs from their home if they see you nearby. \n\n![Kindercatch.jpg](///raw/196/a/z/22b59.jpg)\n\n## The Kindercatch Team\n\n**Artwork - Characters/Environment**\n[MrMustashe](https://www.twitter.com/SirMrMustashe) / [MrMustashe's Deviant Art](https://www.deviantart.com/mrmustashe)\n\n**Artwork - Environment**\n[Afuu](https://www.twitter.com/aphrs_)\n\n**Music**\n[Yagich](https://www.twitter.com/theyagich)\n\n**Voice - Children**\n[Lana Lux](https://www.twitter.com/WTFLanaLux) / [Lana's Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lana_lux)\n\n**Voice - Kindercatch**\n[Dylexion](https://www.mixer.com/dylexion)\n\n**Programming and Animation**\n[LillyByte](https://www.twitter.com/LillyByteGames) / [LillyByte's Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lillybyte)\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//196/a/z/22c01.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/the-kindercatch","author":{"name":"LillyByte","uid":42641,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//196/a/z/9382.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/lillybyte"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//196/a/z/22b59.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//196/a/z/22b59.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://www.lillybyte.com/ld44"},{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.lillybyte.com/ld44/KindercatchWIN.zip"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://www.lillybyte.com/ld44/KindercatchLIN.zip"},{"label":"macOS","url":"http://www.lillybyte.com/ld44/KindercatchMAC.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","linux","mac"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Deep Space Prospector","category":"jam","description":"\n**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n**Description**\n \nDeep Space Prospector is a mining/survival/exploration/space shooter with a nice mood to it (I hope).

Your final score gets printed out on the terminal.\n\n![Cover_image.png](///raw/18b/32/z/21859.png)\n\n![cover3.png](///raw/18b/32/z/218be.png)\n\n## Controls\n\n**Key T** - Take Life -- Move your character over one of your family members and hold the key\n\n**Key G** - Give Life -- Same as above\n\n**Arrow Keys** to move around.\n\n**Key ESC** -- exit game.\n\n### Notes\n\nTo compile from source code is kind of a pain because it takes so dang long.\n\n1. First acquire rust\n2. Then amethyst tools\n3. Then you can run\n\n```bash\nbrew install rust\ncargo install amethyst_tools\ngit clone https://github.com/tfdiaz/lifeless\ncd lifeless\ncargo run\n```\nFirst it will grab all the dependencies which takes a long time. Then it will finally compile. You will get a few warnings but the game should launch! You can also grab the binary and that should work. You need to decompress the file. A folder called Life will have the binary within along with 3 folders font, resources, and texture. Run the executable from that folder and the game should launch.\n\nThank you for taking the time to play my little sad game. It was a painful but very much a satisfying time.\n\nBest,\ntfdiaz","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//18b/32/z/21851.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/lifeless-a-very-depressing-game","author":{"name":"tfdiaz","uid":146305,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/tfdiaz"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//18b/32/z/21859.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//18b/32/z/21859.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//18b/32/z/218be.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//18b/32/z/218be.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/tfdiaz/lifeless"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://github.com/tfdiaz/lifeless/releases/download/v.0.1/Life.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["mac","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Bread And Games","category":"jam","description":"You are a gladiator fighting to buy your freedom and so your life :muscle_tone3: \n\n\nThe game is playable with a .exe here : https://theodull.itch.io/bread-and-games\n\nThe game is playable in your browser here too : https://theodull.itch.io/bread-and-games\n\n**Disclaimer** : Post processing doesn't work with the browser version, so if you want to enjoy the game at how it was initialy made, prefer playing with the windows version.\n\nDon't hesitate to comment, we would be super happy to discuss the game with everyone :wink: \n\nHave fun ! :relaxed:![Capture.JPG](///raw/872/e/z/227b3.jpg)\n\n**Controls : **\n\nWASD / Left Joystick : Move \n\nLeft Clic / A(Pad) / X (Pad) : Attack\n\nRight Clic / B(Pad) / Y (Pad): Shield","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//872/e/z/2277f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/gladiator-project","author":{"name":"Theodull","uid":57976,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//872/e/z/20500.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/theodull"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//872/e/z/227b3.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//872/e/z/227b3.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://theodull.itch.io/bread-and-games"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://theodull.itch.io/bread-and-games"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Pige√≥n Pendejo","category":"jam","description":"Play as a fearless **pigeon** and guide your winged brothers to the promised land.

Not that being a normal butcher didn‚Äôt make good money, but it was KINDA BORING selling the same meats day in and day out.  So you moved into a new cottage, set up a cozy little house/shop, and quickly signed a binding contract with a shady underworldlian chief.  Full permission to hunt in an underworld pocket dimension, in exchange for nothing less than your soul.

Keep Sir Whale and Fatstacks the Hunter alive by [Tab] targeting them and using your 4 abilities.  You allies are wealthy casual adventurers and will pay you in gold for each point of health you restore! When you've amassed enough gold, you can [5] send 1000 gold donations back to your church to receive upgrades to your abilities.  If you collect all the upgrades, you win!\n\n# **Controls:**\n\n[A],[D] or [<-], [->] - Move left/right\n\n[Tab] - Change healing target\n\n# **Abilities:**\n\n[1] - _**Heal Other:**_ After a 1.75 second cast time, heal your ally for 17% of your ally's maximum health.  This ability has a cooldown of 3 seconds.\n\n[2] - _**Charged Heal:**_ Press and hold [2] to build up a powerful healing effect for up to 8 seconds. When released, heal your currently targeted ally for a percentage of their maximum health equal to the percentage of the time spent charging this ability.  This ability has a cooldown of 10 seconds.\n\n[3] - _**Regenerative Leash:**_ After a 1 second cast time, apply a heal over time effect to your targeted ally.  Heals 4% of the ally's maximum health per second for 10 seconds.  This effect will end early if the recipient strays too far from the cleric.  This ability has a cooldown of 20 seconds.\n\n[4] - _**Turn Undead:**_ After a 2 second cast time, destroys all skeletons attacking your party.  Your allies rely on you to kill skeletons, because they are too frightened to fight back.  This ability has a 35 second cooldown.\n\n[5] - _**Donate to the Church:**_ After a 5 second cast time, you use your divine powers to send a gold donation back to your church. Donate 1000 gold per cast to receive the posted ability upgrade in the top right corner of the screen from the church as a blessing.  This ability has a cooldown of 20 seconds.\n\n_**Global Cooldown:**_  All abilities casts place a 2 second cooldown time all abilities.\n\n\nEngine: Unity\n\nArt:    Piskel\n\nSound:  sfxr\n\n\n**CHANGE LOG:**\n\n4/29/2019\n\nBUG FIX:  Corrected a game ending crash that occurred before reaching the victory screen.\n\n4/30/2019\n\nTYPO FIX:  Corrected the title of the game as appears in game and the WebGL link.  The title is \"Contract Cleric\", not \"Contract Healer\".

What brought you down here? Again and Again...\n\n\nOur Dear Friend is a platforming game where you must venture down deep below the earth. Something calls to you, a voice in the darkness. A Friend?\n\n\nArmed with a grappling hook, a bow, and a handful of arrows, you must venture down into the tombs and discover what you're willing to give up along the way.\n\n\n![small2.png](///raw/409/1/z/24068.png)\n\n---CONTROLS---\n\n\nA - Left\n\n\nD - Right\n\n\nW - Jump\n\n\nLeft Click - Fire Grappling Hook\n\n\nHold Right Click - Aim Bow\n\n\nLeft Click (While holding Right Click) - Fire Arrow\n\n\n\n\nCredits: \n\n\nRusty Hayes - Programming, Animation\n\n\nHam - Art, Writing, Sfx\n\n\nDJ Wildebeest - Project Management, Music\n\n\nGrappling Hook courtesy of Sheexy's Grappling Engine\n\n\nFonts by SomePX\n\n\nTIPS:\n\nThere are three platforms on the way down with powerups. Each one is optional but if you pick up the powerup (by touching the mummy in the center of the platform) it will take away some of your maximum health. The first mummy provides more arrows, the next provides a much longer grappling rope, and the third grants a double jump ability. \n\nBe careful with your arrows! While there are a few to pick up on your way there aren't many! Firing one directly after another is a good way to destroy one. \n\nWatch where you step! Use the grappling rope to slowly lower yourself into unseen territory. Always check before firing it and always be ready to use it to defend against incoming bats or spiders!\n\n\nNOTES:\n\n\nAs often happens we had a few bugs crop up late in the jam, including alignment of the music tracks. The Post-Jam version fixes these bugs as well as adds a final scare encounter that was intended to be in the game but not quite finished in the last hours of the jam.\n\nUPDATE: We heard you! An easier postjam version has been added for those who want to see the whole game without putting time into a stupidly hard jam game :P Thank you all for your feedback! The easier version features less damaging enemies, more helpful health pickups, and a grappling hook that kills enemies!\n\nUPDATE 2: After even more helpful feedback we've released a further update pair of builds. We pretty much kept the old \"easy\" build as the current build, which has seen a few improvements and bugfixes. Most notably your guiding aura is now brighter and also has a light that follows the mouse, making it much easier to scope out possible threats before moving forward.\n\nThe new easy build features less damaging enemies and even more potent health pickups.

Can you find all three endings?\n\n[Hint: The ending changes based on how far into the future Timmy has travelled before giving up on the game.]\n\n--- \n## Sweet Squish\nFrom the mobile game company who brought you some of those other games you played every time you were supposed to be socially interacting comes *Sweet Squish!*\n\nFeaturing your FAVOURITE sweet treats, this crazy title puts a real spin on the classic match-3 and match-4 games you play all the time.\n\n### How do I play Sweet Squish?\nSimply click a candy to select it, then click another and they will swap places. Match 3 or 4 in a row or column to _squish_ them. Once you squish all of the candies, you have won the stage, and your score will update on our patented Global Scoreboard, for all your friends (and strangers) to see!\n\nIf you squish candies in the wrong order and you find yourself stuck, do not worry! Simply click the Quit button and try again. We won't even take your ticket away until you successfully clear the level. How nice are we?\n\n### What's a Ticket?\nEach level costs one Ticket to play. Out of tickets? No problem, you can buy more with a small amount of cash - or wait for a brief moment to earn a ticket with the passage of time.\n\n### Global Scoreboard?\nYep, the whole world can see how well (or badly) you do at Sweet Squish. If you don't want people thinking you're terrible at games, you'd better get playing!\n\n### How did you come up with this idea?\nUsing our proprietary Time Accelerator‚Ñ¢ we've been able to harvest the most advanced mobile gaming technology you've ever seen. We created the *best* mobile game of the future, and brought it to the present. You're welcome.\n\n### Don't mobile games exploit people's addictions?\nHere at our company, we take these matters very seriously. That's why we promise to never do bad things with our mobile games. You have our word.\n\n### Is Sweet Squish addictive?\nOf course not. It's fun, and you'll want to keep playing it, but in the good way.\n\n### Can children play Sweet Squish?\nAbsolutely! In fact, our CEO and inventor of the Time Accelerator‚Ñ¢ has just given his son a copy for his 11th birthday. If the game was addictive, that would make him a pretty irresponsible parent!\n\n\n---\n\n## How to play\n#### Sweet Squish Homescreen\nClick the \"Instructions\" button for instructions, the big \"Play\" button to play, and the red X to put away your phone.\n\n#### Dialogue\nPress [Space] when \"[Space]\" appears in the bottom-right, once the dialogue has finished displaying.\n\n#### Bedroom\nClick the Phone in the middle of the room to play Sweet Squish, click the Time Accelerator‚Ñ¢ to advance time, or the door to stop playing Sweet Squish.\n\n#### Sweet Squish\nClick a sweet to select it. Then click another sweet to swap them.\n\nThe aim is to make all sweets in a row or column the same. This will then squish them, and they will disappear. Clear the screen to win a level.\n\n\n## Known Issues on Itch version\nItch.io version won't work in Firefox 66 on Arch Linux. It seems to work in Chromium on Arch Linux with stuttery audio. \n\nSeems to work fine on Windows10 with Firefox Nightly 68.\n\nSometimes the audio plays but the screen stays black. If that happens, just refresh the page and it should work.\n\n#### Headphone users - game may be a bit loud!","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//6b7/c1/z/20dab.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/sweet-squish","author":{"name":"Dvlv","uid":116662,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/dvlv"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/Dvlv/ld44"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://dvlv.itch.io/sweet-squish"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://github.com/Dvlv/ld44/releases/download/0.0.1/sweet_squish_html.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"RoShamBo ++","category":"compo","description":"![Cover Photo.jpg](///raw/590/31/z/20f13.jpg)\n\nWhat if you were given a chance to play a game?\nWhat if that game is a simple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors?\nWhat if that simple game becomes a gamble?\nAnd what if your currency in the gamble is your life?\n\nHow wisely will you use it?

I feel as though I need a badge.\n\nIn my exciting 15th game, you get to experienced the action-packed life of a desert explorer, in the Victorian era. All you arrive with is a map, a small bottle, and 100 pounds (camouflaged as dollars in-game), and you must locate the treasure, hidden miles away, deep into the desert. Your money is only useful for buying some equipment in the starting town; from then on, you must trade your precious water away; your lifeline. Equipment ranges from water-carrying items, helping you survive longer in the desert (and trade for more things), to navigation equipment, which is crucial for not getting lost in the desert.\n\nI've also implemented what I consider to be a rather interesting mechanic: the ability to toward the horizon. This allows you to navigate by the sun and the stars, as well as letting you know when you're nearby to a village, if you're ever lost (which you will be if you don't buy navigation equipment (and aren't a pro navigator)).\n\nI would like to apologize in advance to any astronomers; I have simplified the cosmos quite a bit, due to time, but what you need is all there.\n\nThere is music!

The camera movement behaves slightly differently compared to other 3D games, will probably feel a bit weird at first. The jar is cross-platform (I hope, testing later).\n\n**TUTORIAL**\n\n**Overview**\n\nYou are a drone tasked with defending a transport ship (giant simplex sphere, can't miss it). You need to prevent incoming asteroids from hitting it, and you need to keep it powered. This tutorial is similar to the in game one, but will be a bit more complete. I am not super proud of the in game tutorial, but it is there.\n\n![screenshot.png](///raw/762/d/z/21af8.png)\n\n**Controls**\n\n**Movement**\n\nW - forward\n\nA - left\n\nS - down\n\nD - right\n\n**Abilities**\n\nRMB - fire projectile\n\nQ - match velocity\n\nE - highlight asteroids\n\n**Lose Conditions**\n\n - you can get clobbered by an asteroid.\n - the transport ship can be destroyed by asteroids if it is low enough on energy.\n - the transport ship can run out of energy.\n - your drone can run out of energy.\n - you can lose your connection with the transport ship by going too far away from it.\n\n**Ability Details**\n\n**fire projectile**\n\nif the projectile hits an asteroid, it will slowly convert the asteroids mass to energy, and then fly at you, giving you the energy. If the projectile hits the transport, the energy will just be given to the transport, this is how you power it.\n\n**match velocity**\n\nwhen activated, your autopilot calculates the impulse required to change your velocity to the object your cross hair is on and applies it, using additional energy.\n\n**highlight asteroids**\n\nthe transport ship helps you see the asteroids more clearly, highlighting all the asteroids in blue, and shows asteroids behind the transport ship.\n\n**CAMERA MOVEMENT**\n\nIn most normal 3D games, your mouse movements directly change your pitch and yaw, resulting in a camera that will only spin around when looking directly up or down. In space its harder to define an \"up\" or \"down\", and the inconsistency of the camera can make things difficult in some orientations, so I used a camera system that moves the camera relative to where you are facing at the moment. It is a bit hard to explain exactly what the differences are, but it will probably be apparent when you jump in. I remember it being a bit confusing when I first used it, but I find it more effective in space based games.\n\nI normally do, but I didn't end up adding a keyboard based roll. You can replicate that by moving your mouse in circles, try it out if you want to roll!\n\n**CROSS-PLATFORM DETAILS**\n\nMy engine should allow the jar to be cross-platform, but I don't have easy access to a Linux computer, and while I am writing this I haven't tested on mac. If your platform isn't listed, it should work for the windows jar. Let me know if it works or not so I can either update it here or fix it!\n\nTHANKS FOR PLAYING, AND HAVE FUN.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//762/d/z/2187c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/autotransport","author":{"name":"C1FR1","uid":53863,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//762/d/z/2ab8d.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/c1fr1"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//762/d/z/21af8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//762/d/z/21af8.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://github.com/c1fr1/LD44"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://c1fr1.github.io/downloads/autotransport.jar"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Lifleline Warriors","category":"jam","description":"![unknown.png](///raw/b3a/42/z/24c49.png)\n\n[INFO]\n\nThis is game was created from scratch in 42 hours by 2 persons of which only one was able to really work on it.\nWe continue the development to the point it's finished with some bosses and more stuff so give a lot of feedback(good AND BAD!!!) and maybe you will be a proud winner of a character or weapon or upgrade dedicated to you!

Here we are.\n\nThis ludum dare was a LOT different from my first one. I have 130 hours of 3d modeling under my belt, and tons more experience with Unity. Also, this event wasnt during a school week.\n\nThen, whats the result you might ask. Well. Not amazing, but I guess pretty good compared to last time. The game play is pretty stale, you have to collect health to trade for strength, while avoiding dangers. Sadly, I could program anything that moves towards you, so all dangers are static objects.\n\nI also made a soundtrack, for the first time, I made it because I had time left. Its mediocre at best. There are no sounds effects though.\n\nFinally the level, this is definitly what I like most about this project, the models overall look really nice with the lowpoly style.\n\nI had some issues coverting my project to HTML5, next time Ill have to start it as HTML5 project. So, sorry, next time you'll have a HTML :D.\n\nA note on the \"Mood\" catogory, the mood I aimed for was a relaxed, chill mood.\n\nAnyways, my tired ramble aside, enjoy playing my game!\n\n![MMbackground.png](///raw/708/e1/z/20dff.png)\nSome environment\n\n![Screenshot2.png](///raw/708/e1/z/20e03.png)\nGameplay screenshot","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//708/e1/z/20def.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/grow","author":{"name":"Caspercaper17","uid":124935,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/caspercaper17"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//708/e1/z/20dff.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//708/e1/z/20dff.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//708/e1/z/20e03.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//708/e1/z/20e03.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://bitbucket.org/Caspercaper17/ludum-dare-44-source-code/src/master/"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://caspercaper17.itch.io/grow-ld44"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://caspercaper17.itch.io/grow-ld44"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://caspercaper17.itch.io/grow-ld44"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"60 Days Till Summer","category":"compo","description":"![DaysTillSummer.jpg](///raw/af5/32/z/218f3.jpg)\n\nA text-based game where you, as a school kid, put your heart into everyday events in hope of surviving until summer break comes around.\n\nThe game _never got finished_, but should hopefully still be fun to play around with.

Also don't forget to eat healthy too. \n\n![MainCover.jpg](///raw/8f1/32/z/2114d.jpg)\n\n## States  \n\n* Gaming: \n\nGaming has a chance of increasing your rank. The higher your rank, the more followers you will attract in your next streaming session. You also have a chance of winning small cash prizes. \n\nGaming costs a lot of stress, increases hunger rate and tiredness rate. \n\n* Streaming: \n\nStreaming let's you gain followers. If you have a lot of followers, you will slowely start earning an income. Your rank will ofcourse start dropping if you stop playing games. \n\nStreaming costs a medium amount of stress, slight hunger and slight tiredness. \n\n* Chilling: \n\nChilling decreases your stress slightly, slows hunger rate and slightly returns energy.\n\n* Sleeping: \n\nSleeping decreases lots of stress, slows hunger rate furthur and returns lots of energy. \n\n* Pizza: \n\nClicking on the pizza gives you calories. \n\n* Energy Drink: \n\nClicking on the energy drink gives you a boost of energy at the cost of stress. \n\n\n## Theme & Goal\n\nI interpreted currency and life very broad. You have to balance your life (vitals to live) to achieve your goal. \n\n-> Survive as long as you can.  \n\n## About Me \n\nThis is my first ever game. Not only with Unity, but ever. I used Unity, Photoshop and WavePad to generate and record everything. I used my voice and a built in microphone on my laptop. \n\nThe biggest problem I had was obvioulsy figuring out how to translate my ideas into the right code syntax. I would love if someone would have time to point out what sections I could do better. \n\nThe big struggle I had was having all the variables that I needed for balance spread around all the scripts. I would definatly need a variable manager or something next time so I can tweak the values a lot faster. \n\nAnyway, Let me know what you think. Have fun! \n\n## Edit - Balance\n\nAfter feedback and playing a bit more myself I did figure out that the balance is indeed off. \n\nYou have to keep gaming to make enough money to buy food. But in doing so you will get too much stress / heartrate by day 3 or 4. You will need to rest a lot to lower it, which will make you unable to make enough money anymore. So you either die of food or heartattack. \n\nIt's fun to figure this stuff out, would love to imporve this game and a post - LD version soon. \n\nPhilippe\n\n\n\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8f1/32/z/2112e.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/lazy-boy-3000","author":{"name":"PhilippeM","uid":143864,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/philippem"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8f1/32/z/2114d.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//8f1/32/z/2114d.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SZva6KX_Bx8gKFBUKpJAWmM639aj1V_D"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://shentaku.itch.io/ld-44-lazy-boy-3000"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"cucumber","category":"compo","description":"Play asa cucumber in a colorful platform game!\n\n![S1.png](///raw/00a/d1/z/2235f.png)\n\nUse W/Z to Jumping.\n\nUse A/D to Moving.\n\nUse Arrows (left and right) to set platform.\n\n![S2.png](///raw/00a/d1/z/22368.png)\n\nEnjoy :)\n\n![S3.png](///raw/00a/d1/z/2236a.png)\n\n- thecucumberg.netlify.com","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//00a/d1/z/2118a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/cucumber","author":{"name":"Uriel Bromberg","uid":121344,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//00a/d1/z/20499.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/uriel-bromberg"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//00a/d1/z/2235f.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//00a/d1/z/2235f.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//00a/d1/z/22368.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//00a/d1/z/22368.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//00a/d1/z/2236a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//00a/d1/z/2236a.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"www.thecucumberg.netlify.com"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Nomad","category":"jam","description":"[![Clip1-tallest.gif](///raw/1db/11/z/240d8.gif)](https://lukenofurther.itch.io/nomad)\n\n# üõ∞üí®\n\n# **NOMAD**\n## **Trapped in the gravity well of a galactic black hole**\n\n> You must gather fuel to survive\n\n> Spend fuel to upgrade your ship\n\n> Then look for a way to break free\n\n\n\n**Controls**\n\n> WASD or Arrow keys to move\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n# **[Play now on itch.io](https://lukenofurther.itch.io/nomad)**\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nPsst -

From waking up as early as 4 am to get a headstart in brainstorming concepts and ideas, to staying up as late as 4 am to try and reach the deadline. Working all together in the same physical space day in day out was one of the most beneficial experiences we've had as game developers. It has shown us what working as a team really means and has greatly improved our chemistry as a whole. \n\nThere were many moments in this journey filled with explosions of joy from each of us and desperate lows as problems arose. We really did work until the very last seconds of Ludum Dare and have been passionate throughout the whole thing. It has been something we will always cherish forever and we will definitely be doing the next Ludum Dare in the same way we did this one. As a team, and together. I hope everyone of you had just as much of a beneficial experience as we did and we hope to see you all in the next one. We'll be keeping an eye out for those of you that caught our attention this time. \n\nAlso make sure to check out our discord server, to stay up to date with our actual games and to keep in touch with us.

Press the SPACE BAR to access this upgrade menu. There is one thing I should mention, while you can use these Quantum Energy Balls with the suit there is a cost to so this and it is a percentage of your lifeforce. The good news is the suit will not allow you to use all of your lifeforce if you don't have enough. \n\nI mentioned the suit can attack, where ever your mouse pointer is when you click the left mouse button is where the suit will attack. As you move about the lab you will find robot guards, a special shield to protect you and some salve to heal your lifeforce. You will also find keys hidden in different areas you can use on the locked doors.\n\nArrow Keys to Move\nMouse to aim/ LMB to fire. There is no special crosshair for the mouse pointer.\nSpace to open the upgrade menu.\n\nThe flashing yellow graphics are Electric Walls. Touch them and you die.

In all honestly the idea was very doable in 48 hours. I originally wanted 4 levels with 16 rooms each. To create all of those rooms should have taken me no more than 4-6 hours but I didn't get to make the rooms until 3 hours before the end. I spent WAAAAY to much time figuring out solutions to problems I never should have had and I didn't get them all solved. So I had to cut things. I made one level that has repeat rooms. I only used 1 enemy of the 3 I had made and tested with. Because the game only has 1 level it kind of makes the upgrade menu I made useless, its there and it works though. I was able to get some sounds and music into the game as well as a win and lose screen.\n\nSo please enjoy my creation, but know I had planned for something much more entertaining. \n\nOh and I know I could have switched to the Jam, but I have work in the morning and wouldn't have had the time to work on it.

All in all, the learning, experimenting, and actual execution of the character and animations took just over a day, with probably half that spent on a character I ended up not using! Oops.\n\nI wasn't expecting to be able to pull off a game given that the character took up so much more time than I anticipated, but it all came together in the last few hours. I was hoping to spend more time on the environment art especially, but I'm still not a very fast modeler so I had to go with a simple modular/tile-based environment instead. It'd have looked amazing with some shrubs along the paths, and non-square corners - maybe next time I'll make it that far.\n\nFor the texturing I used a mix of Photoshop and Krita. This was my first time using Krita, and I found the wrap/tiled editing mode very useful! It also has some nice default brushes that made the creation of the ground textures very fast. With the selection of brushes I have in Photoshop, it still won for speed/quality of painting actual textures like the wood logs that make up the witch doctor hut, even though I then brought it into Krita to finish it up in its wrap/tiling mode.\n\nThe coding went reasonably smoothly with only a few small bugs during the development that were quickly resolved - no real head-scratchers.\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//859/z/218b7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/jungle-magic","author":{"name":"rsim","uid":2392,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/rsim"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//859/z/218bd.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//859/z/218bd.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://cutecrittergames.com/ld44/JungleMagic-win64.zip"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://cutecrittergames.com/ld44/"},{"label":"Source code","url":"http://cutecrittergames.com/ld44/JungleMagic-source.zip"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Cursed Fight","category":"compo","description":"You are a fedora wearing, square hating, cursed triangle, who has to fight waves of squares to rid the world of them.

Press the next arrow to end your turn. \nDefense (or completely negates) incoming damage. \n\nThere are three ways to regain health: \n1. At the end of your turn you gain +1 health (this can be upgraded).\n2.  Blocking all incoming damage is likely to drop some health\n3. Killing an enemy gives you health. \n\nThere are three classes of enemies: \n1, Brutes are basic guys who on average has higher attack than other classes, \n2. Healers can heal their allies on their turn\n3. Tanks have a lot of health but generally low attack\n\nMoving the slider around increases a multiplier that increases the damage and health cost to play defensive and offensive cards. This is useful because of how the game gets harder as it goes on, but it is ultimately not a great mechanic that it would replace with a full upgrade system if I had time. \n\nOkay, I think that's all.

Invest your lifetime in the right choices and beat the highscore by leading the most successful life. You do so by choosing actions at every age that make you succeed in different areas:  Start as a toddler facing the existential question whether to eat your vegetables or not, daydream as a child, survive puberty with the aid of emo music and have a career without burnout. Every age brings in new needs and desires, and you cannot fulfill them all - or can you?\n![cover-image-03.png](///raw/03d/22/z/2367c.png)\n![Bildschirmfoto 2019-04-30 um 03.48.23.png](///raw/03d/22/z/235ed.png)\n![Bildschirmfoto 2019-04-30 um 03.54.05.png](///raw/03d/22/z/23628.png)\n\n# How to Play\n\n1. Select a player character\n\n2. You will automatically go through the ages of toddler, child, teen, adult and senior. Your current age is displayed on the left. \n\n3. The bars to the right mark your lifegoals and needs. You start with three basic needs, but while you're aging up, new desires will show up.\n\n4. Score points on lifetime goals with the use of actions. Each action will cost you a portion of your lifetime and may have various positive and negative effects on multiple goals, so choose them carefully!\n\n5. Try to score as high as possible on the green goals, but don't let the orange ones drop to low! Once one of them reaches zero, you die and the round is over.\n\n# Controls:\n\n## mouse: \nselect and confirm action \n## Left and right arrow keys: \nswitch between the main screen an the action menu","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//03d/22/z/23552.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/whats-your-lifetime-value","author":{"name":"BlackLambert","uid":122563,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//3ce/d1/z/20687.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/blacklambert"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//03d/22/z/2367c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//03d/22/z/2367c.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//03d/22/z/235ed.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//03d/22/z/235ed.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//03d/22/z/23628.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//03d/22/z/23628.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://blacklambert.itch.io/whats-your-lifetime-value"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Hell's Business","category":"compo","description":"![Cover.png](///raw/1e1/8/z/21543.png)\nIt's done!

However, then you cannot use them in future movies... \n\nTry to produce as many movies as possible, or set out to fulfill specific achievements like setting up the iconic fight between ‚ÄúMashed Potato‚Äù and his nemesis ‚ÄúDark Potato‚Äù. Watch out that you don't exhaust your actors with too much work, or neglect some characters entirely.\n\nBest played in portrait, on touch screen or desktop. If the game is too big, remember you can scale on all browsers with CTRL and +/- keys.\n![main_screen.png](///raw/4cd/b1/z/21cb8.png)\n![frame.png](///raw/4cd/b1/z/23a3e.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//4cd/b1/z/21cbf.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/superhero-movie-universe-simulator","author":{"name":"halfmule","uid":114116,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//4cd/b1/z/252eb.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/halfmule"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//4cd/b1/z/21cb8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//4cd/b1/z/21cb8.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//4cd/b1/z/23a3e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//4cd/b1/z/23a3e.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://halfmule.itch.io/smus"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://ld44.diceandfall.com"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://bitbucket.org/GreatHalf/ld44/src/master/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Life's a Dish","category":"jam","description":"![2019-04-29.png](///raw/f35/6/z/22820.png)\n\n# Life's A Dish\n---\n![2019-04-29 (1).png](///raw/f35/6/z/22822.png)\n## Premise\n\nLife's a Dish is a game about cultivating and mutating cultures of bacteria. Some cultures are worth more than others, and one combination is special. It will cure THE ENEMY, a terrible disease. You have it, and you have 30 days to live. You must use the tools in front of you, turn your starting cultures into the perfect antidote. \n\nMutate and combine your life, sell it, and repeat.\n \n---\n![2019-04-29 (7).png](///raw/f35/6/z/2281a.png)\n## The Disease\n\nIt goes by many names. The Lord's Plague. Silencia. Death. Once infected, most die within weeks. You, one of the final scientists still alive in London, have been tasked with finding a cure. Unfortunately, you're also infected, and your suppliers will not risk their lives to deliver the reagents you need without paying a hefty price. Find the perfect antidote, and you can kill it. But, you only have 30 days before it kills you...\n\n---\n![2019-04-29 (9).png](///raw/f35/6/z/22826.png)\n## Petri Dishes\n\nEach Petri dish contains a culture, the life that will fund your research, and perhaps, yield the antidote you desperately seek. Petri dishes can be placed on the table (as pictured, or in machines that provide various mutations).\n\nCultures grow or shrink over time based on their genome, so watch out! They might just die on you. \n\n---\n![2019-04-29 (4).png](///raw/f35/6/z/2282a.png)\n## Check-o-Matic\n\nThe Check-o-Matic is the first machine you might use, it tells you how close you are to a cure. When a culture has been graded, you can sell it at a higher rate than non-graded. (Unless you are very far away).\n\n---\n![2019-04-29 (5).png](///raw/f35/6/z/22816.png)\n## Reagents\n\nThere are eight (8) reagents that you can purchase. They go into the Genimagic (Below). Simply drag from the top to get a unit of the substance. They modify the genome in each culture. But sometimes they can backfire.\n\n### Descriptions\n- Sulfur: Hot & Smelly (20 coin)\n- Ice: Very Cold (20 coin)\n- Lead: Makes you mad! (30 coin)\n- Lithium: Soothing (40 coin)\n- Sugar: Zoom Zoom! (40 coin)\n- Lard: and how! (40 coin)\n- Radium: Magnetic (40 coin)\n- Iodine: Stabilizer (80 coin)\n\n---\n![2019-04-29 (11).png](///raw/f35/6/z/2285c.png)\n## Genimagic\n\nThe Genimagic takes in Reagents and applies them to an inserted Culture. It applies them one at a time, and you can hit EJECT at any time to stop, but you can't go back. Each time you apply a reagent the genome is modified and mutated, so there is a chance that your effects are undone. (Part of the genome controls how often this happens).\n\nThe Genimagic shows the likelyhood of mutation (and perhaps even killing the Culture, so don't let that get too high).\n\n---\n![2019-04-29 (3).png](///raw/f35/6/z/22815.png)\n## Amalgamizer\n\nThe Amalgamizer has three slots. Two are for cultures, the other is for empty Petri Dishes. You can put one or two cultures in the top, and it will combine them in the second by taking half. For example say that you had a Red culture in the top left, and a blue culture in the top right: you can expect to get a purple culture. If you only put one culture in, it just moves half of the culture to the empty dish.\n\nHowever, the newly created culture is mutated, so like with the Gneimagic it is possible to have unintended consequences.\n\nBe warned. Your initial cultures are quite small - you would be wise not to split them while they're so young.\n\n---\n![2019-04-29 (6).png](///raw/f35/6/z/22817.png)\n## Coins\n\nYou can use coins to buy empty Petri dishes or Reagents. But the only way to make money is by selling you Cultures, and the more like the antidote is, the more valuable it is! (drag your cultures into the pneumatic tube)\n\n---\n# Notes\n\nWe opted out of the audio category, as we used royalty-free background music.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f35/6/z/2278c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/lifes-a-dish","author":{"name":"dxk2294","uid":25919,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f35/6/z/311bc.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/dxk2294"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f35/6/z/22820.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f35/6/z/22820.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f35/6/z/22822.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f35/6/z/22822.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f35/6/z/2281a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f35/6/z/2281a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f35/6/z/22826.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f35/6/z/22826.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f35/6/z/2282a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f35/6/z/2282a.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f35/6/z/22816.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f35/6/z/22816.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f35/6/z/2285c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f35/6/z/2285c.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f35/6/z/22815.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f35/6/z/22815.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f35/6/z/22817.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f35/6/z/22817.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/dxk2294/ProjectAlmond"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://dxk2294.itch.io/lifes-a-dish"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://dxk2294.itch.io/lifes-a-dish"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://dxk2294.itch.io/lifes-a-dish"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Ziggy's Life","category":"compo","description":"![LD44ZiggysLife.png](///raw/75c/71/z/216cd.png)\n\n-------- BASIC  --------\n\nWASD/Arrows = Move\n\nM = Music\n\nZXC = Buy in shop\n\nSPACE = Punch (If close enough)\n\nYou will slowly have declining health (too few cig's)\nEarn cigars by subduing/punching fellow inmates or wardens.\n\n-------- HISTORY  --------\n\nThe game of Ziggy who was wrongly convicted... sentenced to prison time - of course trying to avoid getting involved in fighting but .... he'll just die if he runs out of cigs. \nA guy in the cafeteria offers to sell him some of the good stuff to boost him but hey.... he wants cigs and only way to get them... well \"talk\" to the other inmates or the wardens.\n\n-------- BUGS  --------\n\nInmates / Wardens will get stuck on eachother and walls.\n\n-------- LD44  --------\n\nWell didn't have enough time this weekend - only about a third but here GOES!

Game itself is sorta cosy, though; maybe put the FTL soundtrack on while playing for some ambiance.\n\n**Software:** Unity, Visual Studio, Affinity Designer, Famitracker, Audacity.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c27/91/z/2154b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/kessler","author":{"name":"Melmo","uid":104236,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c27/91/z/20ac6.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/melmo"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c27/91/z/2156d.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c27/91/z/2156d.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//c27/91/z/2156e.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//c27/91/z/2156e.gif"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CHJCNLSoIZnFHFD2RHohQH9Nd8TI6T6e/view?usp=sharing"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://indpc.itch.io/kessler"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FviNjWOslymlAcD4c0CWCtzrK4AAHCfW/view?usp=sharing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"SpaceChips","category":"compo","description":"So this is my first ludum dare game! \nI didn't had time to start the game on the first day,\nand have roughly 10hr to make the game (Comp).\nso its untested/unbalanced.\nbut none the less its still a playable version\n\npost-comp version:\nhere i fixed bugs, changed balance, enabled the player rotation,\nreduced player collider size and actual size,\nchange Enemy random generator properties so they are more Extreme,\nchanged the upgrades in cost and in what they give,\nmade so projectiles fire from all directions instead of straight line,\n\nbasically this is all the changes.\nmight be too much for a bug fix,\nso This is a Post-comp!\n\nActuall time working on project 30hr post-.\n![fdee7aee583af58397cdc536af7d40f1.png](///raw/2a0/32/z/23c5c.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2a0/32/z/22b83.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/my-bullet-hell-ludumdare-entry","author":{"name":"Avoca-do","uid":143522,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/avoca-do"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//2a0/32/z/23c5c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//2a0/32/z/23c5c.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1APdlYAOi_GAtMJ4uaiIHZM5LNY-JAxIp"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lTEUM7dqByXK2O3HMrrjZTd_09P52X4k"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1L8s7HZizoPYxz0aHQPYlkQVbeFZbtUDX"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"cut'n'align","category":"jam","description":"cut'n'align is a puzzle game for browser for both PC and smart phone.\n![cna.png](///raw/6a8/22/z/2240a.png)\nIf three or more the same object are aligned in a horizontal, vertical, or cross line, objects are erased.\n\nEbiten is licensed under Apache license version 2.0.

This version lacks proper game balance, there are no sound effects, crit attacks and weapon effects.

In the battle mode you have three buttons: (1) the left one with the crosshair switches between enemies to select the one you want to attack; (2) the middle one with swords attacks enemy with your weapon; (3) the right one opens the inventory.\n\nIn the inventory menu you have three pages: weapons, throwables and food. Weapons can have up to three upgrades (represented with skull), with the basic weapon (no skulls) being very weak and each upgrade adding great power to it (power of the demon!) but you have to pay with your life points to get the upgrade! Hover mouse over the item to see its stats (note, weapon effects and critical hit are not ready yet). Clicking on the weapon in the inventory gives you options to upgrade it and equip it.\n\nYou can throw throwables into an enemy. Click on the item and choose \"Throw\" to do that.\n\nFinally, the food is there to recovery your health points.\n\nAfter each battle you stop in a shop to refill your supplies. You can buy throwables and food for money (you get money for killing enemies), or you can buy new weapons with your health points.\n\nNote\n====\n\nWebGL build is very dark in some places and overbright in others (because of \"Gamma\" color space instead of \"Linear\" to support more browsers). Please try Windows or OSX executable if you can! \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//191/f1/z/23609.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/black-friday-shopping","author":{"name":"Evgeniya Zapolnova","uid":127377,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//191/f1/z/1f4d6.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/evgeniya-zapolnova"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//191/f1/z/23672.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//191/f1/z/23672.png"}],"links":[{"label":"macOS","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/afozpgs625v2c3k/BlackFridayOSX_v2.zip?dl=1"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/8j3crputn7dtk6t/BlackFriday_Win_V2.zip?dl=1"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://myxa42.github.io/ldjam44_blackfriday/"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/myxa42/ldjam44_blackfriday"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/45xb2h6iman3ayd/BlackFridayOSX.zip?dl=1"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["mac","desktop","win","web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Boxes Rush","category":"compo","description":"\n\nAbout This Game\n\nIn this game you need to collect coins to complete the game.

Two to four players compete to try and last the longest each round while trying to collect as many life hearts and power-ups as possible. Each power-up contains a special property that can hurt or heal each player. Hearts, drop randomly and add small amounts health to each player, +10 to +20. TNT- creates an explosion that harms multiple players, -35 health. Cardiac arrest steals the health of whoever grabs it, -35. Glue- slows down whoever runs through it. Soul Stealer- Shoots out and whoever gets hit cannot move, damage ranges from -20 to -30 health. Life Boost- Adds a hefty boost of health to whoever grabs it, +25. \n\nBackground \n----------------------------\nYou and your cartoon friends are trying to survive as long as you can through various stages of a predicted apocalypse. As this world is dying rapidly, so are you, fight your friends to survive by gathering the last bit of life that is leaking from your world.

Now none of the art has been done for these cards, the thing is that there are essentially only 8 functions these cards will serve with 5 of them being the heirloom cards that will be hard to obtain.\nIf you were playing this and got the same item every time your strength stat was increased would you be annoyed?

However you must look after your family, who rely on you to pay for food, heating fuel and medicine. It's game over if you die in battle or your family dies due to hunger/coldness/illness.\n\n## *How To Run*\n - Windows: Just run **Ludum.exe** contained within the binaries folder\n - **Important:** The Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2017 is required to run on Windows. It is available [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/) under the Redistributable and Build Tools section.\n\n\n - Linux:   Just run **./Ludum** from terminal while in the binaries folder\n - **Important:** [CSFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/csfml/) 2.5 is required to be installed for the Linux version to work. Check your package manager.\n\n## *Controls*\n\n - W/A/S/D: Move your gladiator\n - Shift: Brings up your shield (If you have one)\n - Left click / Right click: Attack and Special Attack\n\n## *Family Happiness*\n\nThis symbol shows how well fed your family are, the more it goes grey the hungrier they get.\n\n![food0-sheet.png](///raw/a5c/11/z/22e2e.png)\n\nThis symbol shows the how well heated your family are, if the fire gets low it'll begin to show freezing ice, which really isn't good for their health.\n![heat0-sheet.png](///raw/a5c/11/z/22e26.png)\n\nFinally this symbol shows if your family are ill and need medicine, family members are more likely to fall ill if they're cold or hungry.\n![Healthy-sheet.png](///raw/a5c/11/z/22e30.png)\n\n## *Weapons*\n\n - Fists (*default*): Just punch them, either hand. They'll die\n   eventually. \n   \n - Sword: Good for stabbing and slashing, does way more\n   damage than just punching your opponents. \n - Spear: Its like a sword on a stick, very good for distant stabbing, even better when you throw it (Right Mouse Button) \n - Shield: The shield isn't really a weapon, but you will want to know about it. Holding the shift key will bring up your shield (if your character has bought one) you won't negate all damage, but you'll live longer if you utilise it well.\n\n## *Screenshots!*\n![Screenshot.jpg](///raw/a5c/11/z/22e43.jpg)\n![battle.jpg](///raw/a5c/11/z/22e7a.jpg)\n![unknown.png](///raw/a5c/11/z/22ebc.png)\n## *Technical Stuff*\nWritten using CSFML\n## *Us*\n\n - Programming: James Bulman\n - Artist: Cameron Thornton [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shubwub) | [Portfolio Site](https://cameronthornton.dev/)\n - Programming: Matthew Threlfall [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MatttDewitt) | [Blog](https://threlfall.dev)\n - Music: Alex Goldsack [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Goldie643)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a5c/11/z/22edd.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/dadiator","author":{"name":"Ametentia","uid":72794,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a5c/11/z/19c53.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/ametentia"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a5c/11/z/22e2e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a5c/11/z/22e2e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a5c/11/z/22e26.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a5c/11/z/22e26.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a5c/11/z/22e30.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a5c/11/z/22e30.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a5c/11/z/22e43.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a5c/11/z/22e43.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a5c/11/z/22e7a.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a5c/11/z/22e7a.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a5c/11/z/22ebc.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a5c/11/z/22ebc.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://github.com/Ametentia/LD44"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://mega.nz/#!WghwXKrA!CZM0sh7mEcoaaOEwoot08mcwSONqfqN5gRruzCy-Ibc"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://mega.nz/#!b4xlRSJK!H4va4jzFOjCktViJnmozJ_XoOBaVsWZSqPJF-6J9cDs"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Flow","category":"jam","description":"Demo worth watching to avoid confusion!

With my first game I made a lot of basic  mistakes, like making it way too ambitious and not splitting my time correctly. I have definitely learned from my mistakes, but couldn'd quite avoid all of them this time either. On top of that I had a test on Monday after the weekend, that I needed to study for.\n\nBut despite the severe lack of time, I managed to pick a theme that wasn't too abitious and code most of the basic functions I had invisiond. Sadly I didn't have time to make proper \"Start\" and \"Game Over\" screens, my game also lacked animations, maps(combined with pathfainding for the enemies with something like [A*](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html)), buyable abilities (like bigger bullets) and proper music.\nA big time waster for me was choosing a theme, because I couldn't decide on a theme the first day, my time  on the project was massively reduced. Apart from this I spent most of my time coding.\n\nBut despite all those shotcommings I'm still pretty proud of this project, and it was a lot of fun to make. Since this was also my first game related programming project in the last 2 monts, it was like a breath of fresh air.\n\nWhen I compare this to my last game([my game for LD43]( https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/dark-sacrifice)) the main improovement are art (still not good, but there is an improovement, except for the \"game over\" screen ^^), music (still awful, but at least there are some soundeffects and a 2 second loop song), \"finishedness\" and planning of the project.\n\nAfter finishing the project it felt great to look at my checklist and see all the \"essential\" features ticked off (about 70% of all features).\n\nThanks for reading and playing my game.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//8c0/f1/z/21182.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/pay-with-your-life","author":{"name":"Peterrior55","uid":127176,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/peterrior55"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/730499?updated=1556484501"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_Jph-XqfqQNYuFkEVPcYepR2yYUBj_A8?usp=sharing"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ifSLakwprWsqrwi9uApW_yQ4Lm4Vf04J/view?usp=sharing"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"The Adventures of Bileous","category":"compo","description":"The Robo-Lizards have taken over Crankville! Smashing shops, building huts, everything being in chaos.\nMeanwhile, young adult Bileous isn't worrying about the Robo-Lizards. He's just living a life in exalted solitude, trying to be outside as little as possible, as if he's outside, then he's more likely to get a scar or two than get a small sunburn in summer. You see, Bileous is a social outcast. He messed up a VERY important meeting on accident, and that lowered his social currency into the negative thousands. So, there goes any chance AT ALL to be said \"Hi\" to or to be given anything more than dirt on his birthday.\n\nBut then, the Robo-Lizards put everyone in jail, except Bileous! (he's very protected from everything - even dust particles are eliminated from his house!!!) And then, Bileous knew how to win everybody's hearts. How to bring his social currency to the positives. He would have to... defeat the Robo-Lizards!!!\n\nUnfortunately for Bileous, he couldn't by any protection because 1. everybody was imprisoned and 2. even if the armorer wasn't imprisoned, he couldn't buy anything from anybody in Crankville. So, he had to risk his life to do this - therefore, his life (whether he lived or not) was his social currency.\n\nTo blow up the control/production center for the robots, Bileous has to get five things: a key, a switch, a hijacker, a computer, and a wrench. They are scattered all around a map covered with Robo-Lizards - which are kind of hard to evade. But it will be worth it... if you can actually survive. Good luck, Bileous! :) Also, Robo-Huts spawn infinite numbers of Robo-Lizards. Fortunately for Bileous, if there are too many Robo-Lizards at once, then the system crashes and therefore some of the Robo-Lizards have to self-destruct to stabilize the system.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//480/22/z/21898.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/the-adventures-of-bileous-1","author":{"name":"LyghtningWither","uid":139396,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//480/22/z/2a2c4.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/lyghtningwither"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://honeyfun.itch.io/the-adventures-of-bileous"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://honeyfun.itch.io/the-adventures-of-bileous"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://honeyfun.itch.io/the-adventures-of-bileous"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"LifeSaver","category":"compo","description":"My first Ludum Dare!\n\n\nThis game is a Singleplayer shooter platformer where the player uses their lives to purchase weapons and upgrades which increases their abilities.\n\nTools:\nGame Engine: Unity\nIDE: Visual Studio 2017\nSound: Bosca Ceoli\nGraphics: https://www.pixilart.com/\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//7ea/32/z/217aa.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/lifetaker","author":{"name":"Wesley Vong","uid":146151,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/wesley-vong"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/WesleyVong/Ludum-Dare-44"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://1drv.ms/f/s!AuqppfJkchqLanF4hZ2ChO9EN9g"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://1drv.ms/f/s!AuqppfJkchqLanF4hZ2ChO9EN9g"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://wesleyvong.com/LD44"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["mac","desktop","win","web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Cards of Life","category":"compo","description":"This is a game created for Ludum Dare 44.

I give people a good show and, in exchange, they give me their soul. \n\nWin-win. \n\nIt's totally fair.\n\nHaving a show like this is not easy, the key is to keep the mystery.\n\nNo matter how incredible it is, if people knew how it goes, they would not pay the price.\n\n-------\n\n![Captura3.png](///raw/445/41/z/246dd.png)\n\n-------\n\n# Controls\n\n- ** Click ** or ** Spacebar ** to keep talking\n\n- ** Green ** and ** Red buttons ** to let people go in or not\n\n- ** Click ** on the ** arrows ** to change the camera view\n\n-------\n\n![Captura4.png](///raw/445/41/z/246df.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//445/41/z/246a4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/the-greatest-show","author":{"name":"FranVadillo","uid":83268,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/franvadillo"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//445/41/z/246e2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//445/41/z/246e2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//445/41/z/246dd.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//445/41/z/246dd.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//445/41/z/246df.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//445/41/z/246df.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://franvadillo.itch.io/the-greatest-show"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Space Pilot","category":"jam","description":"![Docking_Tuto_V2.png](///raw/a49/21/z/23fa3.png)\n![Input_Tuto_V2.png](///raw/a49/21/z/23fa4.png)\n\nHave Fun :D\n\n**Change Log:**\n- Fix reset Button\n- Fix Spaceship window Z position (Now you see it ^^)\n- Fix Fx\n- Fix Tutorial button.\n- Now Qwerty is suported.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a49/21/z/24a29.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/space-pilot","author":{"name":"Kaiomoi","uid":76106,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a49/21/z/f242.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/kaiomoi"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a49/21/z/23fa3.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a49/21/z/23fa3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//a49/21/z/23fa4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//a49/21/z/23fa4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://kaiomoi.itch.io/space-pilot"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://kaiomoi.itch.io/space-pilot"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Butt Poke","category":"jam","description":"![Screenshot from 2019-04-29 21-35-45.png](///raw/a3f/2/z/22e55.png)\n\n# Butt Poke\n\nYou're the devil's employee.

It's you! A vampire who pays the Devil in his blood in exchange for cool powers that happen to be playing cards.\n\n## Gameplay:\nThe gameplay is split in two parts:\n**In-Fight** and **Preparation**\n\n### In-Fight\nWhat's up here? You, the vampire lord just revived and bloodthirsty, are going to enslave and eat *(or drink?)* the fauna and humankind!\nFighting is a mix of automated battle with roundbased decisions, where you can trade-off between short and longterm benefits to your character. If you are low on health or fighting a boss, you might be interested in healing or per-fight buffs, where in safe fights you might want to invest into permanent stat boosts to be able to stand against stronger enemies.\n\n**After each round** (which ends once every character has attacked) you are presented three cards of whom you can choose to buy one (or none). Choose wisely!\nAfter buying, you can play handcards. Thereafter the fight continues.\n\n### Preparation\nThe fight is won, what's now? Now, you are doomed to choose how to fight in the next battle.\nYou start as a claw-scratching bloodsucker (literally, you wield your claws as a weapon and your equiped skill is sucking blood), but you can be so much more!\n - A summoner who turns slayed enemies into loyal minions\n - A warrior who crushes the enemies and falls into bloodrage\n - A sorcerer who leeches live like a champion\n - A rogue dodging his way through fights\n - ... or a crazy combination of it\n\nYou can equip a weapon, that defines how hard your basic attack hits and gives a bonus to your stats, like Health, Dodge, Armor, Life Leech Rate, ... . Also each weapon is connected to a class (like Dagger -> Rogue) and increases your class level. Those class levels can be upgraded after boss fights, elite enemies and at the very beginning of the game\n\nAdditionally, you can equip one skill, which is more powerfull the better you are in it's class (like summoner, ...).\nA Skill is used every X attacks, which is dependent on the skill and your level in it's class.\n\n# Have fun!\nIt was fun to create the game and we hope it's as much fun for you to play it!","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b01/3/z/24c27.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/bloodcurse-recast","author":{"name":"muffty","uid":12555,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/muffty"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b01/3/z/24c28.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b01/3/z/24c28.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1guzY6nhzfVrYv4whQdZVP9jRk9rOBMUV"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://muffty.github.io/BloodcurseRecast/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Blood Thief","category":"jam","description":"# Blood Thief\n\nYou incarnate a Vampire in his quest to vengeance and blood lust !

We aspired to this goal in 2 ways:\n\n1. You are a mercenary for hire in a dangerous job. Your life is the currency that your employers spend to achieve their goals.\n2. Your ships absorbs enemy damage as energy. When you run out of capacity, it explodes. However, that energy can used to trigger power-ups. Thus, your ship's \"life\" is the currency which you spend on those power-ups.\n\n## Intro Text\n\nIn the war-torn future, human life is one of the most valuable currencies. The AI Accords of 2246 forbid machines from choosing to harm a sentient being. Therefore, expendable mercenaries like you are recruited to pilot mostly autonomous ships of awesome destructive power in order to make those life-and-death decisions.\n\nYour armed escort service has a rare advantage. Your salvaged Andromedan ship acts like a giant capacitor that can absorb energy weapon fire. You can harness this sea of current to power one of your custom upgrades. But be warned... if the batteries fill beyond capacity, you'll rediscover the old saying:\n\n*Andromedans live on PHASER'S EDGE.*\n\n## Screen Captures\n\nIntro                                     |  Winning!\n:----------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:\n![Splash.PNG](///raw/01e/12/z/230bc.png)  |  ![Winning.PNG](///raw/01e/12/z/2311a.png)\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//01e/12/z/22d30.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/phasers-edge","author":{"name":"ComicSans","uid":138768,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/comicsans"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//01e/12/z/230bc.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//01e/12/z/230bc.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//01e/12/z/2311a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//01e/12/z/2311a.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://edge.mcbarron.net/"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Les liens du sang","category":"jam","description":"![LiensDuSang_High.png](///raw/49e/1/z/2466e.png)\n\n\n![Screenshot.png](///raw/49e/1/z/24670.png)\n\n\nIn this game you have to make your family grow and thrive through the ages. \nThe only way to do this, is by marriage ! \n\nEarn money and influence by managing the lives of your heirs. \n\nThe fate of your family rests in your hands, try not to be the one who will end your own name.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCode : BOMBAIL Hugo\n\nCode : GARCIA Axel\n\nSound Design : CHASTAGNOL Thomas\n\nMusics : SALESSE Matthieu\n\nGraphics : FURLAN Marine\n\nGame Design : ESPINASSE Marine\n\nGame Design : CLAISSE Jean\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//929/52/z/24669.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/les-liens-du-sang","author":{"name":"Steing","uid":7505,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//15d/1/z/1436b.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/steing"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//49e/1/z/2466e.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//49e/1/z/2466e.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//49e/1/z/24670.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//49e/1/z/24670.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://fafastudio.itch.io/les-liens-du-sang"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://fafastudio.itch.io/les-liens-du-sang"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Gladiator Souls","category":"jam","description":"\n![2019-04-30 04_25_00-.png](///content/f4e/z/2380a.png)\n\n# Story\n\nYour goal is to lead your gladiator onto the path of glory !\n\nTo do so, you shall defeat the other gladiators with as much style as possible.

After that try exiting out of the shop and see what happens!\n\nThe game consists of a shop part and 10 underground parts which have **increasing difficulty**. **Coins** are scattered across the stage and can be collected for higher scores and more challenge.\n\nWhen you finish the game you will see a **leaderboard** that contains all the scores of other players who have completed it. You can try getting more coins for higher scores and maybe even reach the highest score: **1000 points**.\n  \n-----------------------------------\n\n## Tools Used ##\n\n- Unity 3D Game Engine\n- Visual Studio\n- Aseprite\n- [dreamlo](dreamlo.com) (for the leaderboard)\n- Music generated with\n[cgMusic](http://codeminion.com/blogs/maciek/2008/05/cgmusic-computers-create-music/).\n\n------------------------------\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//52f/22/z/23e4c.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/welcome","author":{"name":"agurcan","uid":143141,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/agurcan"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//52f/22/z/227e6.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//52f/22/z/227e6.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//52f/22/z/227d7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//52f/22/z/227d7.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//52f/22/z/227f2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//52f/22/z/227f2.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://agurcan.itch.io/welcome"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://agurcan.itch.io/welcome"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://agurcan.itch.io/welcome"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop","mac"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Our Mechanical Life","category":"jam","description":"It's about money, time, relationship, money and life.![Our Mechanical Life.png](///raw/946/42/z/22a51.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//946/42/z/22a61.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/our-mechanical-life","author":{"name":"qlqrcoisa","uid":149065,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/qlqrcoisa"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//946/42/z/22a51.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//946/42/z/22a51.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/17XjPnszZM2MkDpKjLijmPCJM6zx94akB/view?fbclid=IwAR1wV7-Sxks9rVT_PCgay95rgGn3hFtghk305I3ZLo2G950cJKLyHH5Epcg"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://joaog.itch.io/our-mechanical-life"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://joaog.itch.io/our-mechanical-life"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Slave Odyssey","category":"jam","description":"## Context\n\nSlave Odyssey is a shoot 'em up about selling (or not ?) your crew members :couple: :two_men_holding_hands: :two_women_holding_hands:.\n\nYour choices will influence the ship captain's psychology !

She wanders the streets in search of shelter, snax, a place to warmly loaf, and most of all, companionship. \n\nBut be careful out there, brave cat! There are foes aplenty and only but a few furiends. Her foes are furmidable and may take a toll.\n\nIf she fears she is not strong enough to make it through the streets on her own, there are mystic cat ways of seeking help.\n\nShe may **purchase a few pawers** to help her on her journeys. But know this, small cat. The cost is high... The highest any cat could hope to pay.\n\nShe must pay it with her lives.\n\nLike any cat, she entered this world with **nine lives**. To help her on her journeys, she can use these lives to purchase pawerful advantages against her street foes. But **beware**!

This is intended for players who had trouble with beating the original version, but we encourage you to **try the original version first!** :)\n\n5/1/2019 (a few hours later) - We remastered **easy mode** to now feature a health bonus for the player.

Robots can then equip those body parts to create powerful fighters or absolute freaks of ~~nature~~... robotics?\n\n--------------------------\n\n**Features:**\n\n- **36** different* body parts to unlock, equip, bet and lose. Including heads, arms, legs, torsos and a potted plant!\n- Fight against randomly but still fairly generated robots! You can also fight two at once for double the reward!\n- Fight against **8** different champions to unlock new parts!\n- Exchange two parts you don't need in **THE SHOP** for a better one!\n\n(*Well... some are at least graphically different.)\n\n--------------------------\n\n**Good things to know:**\n\n- **Use your momentum to launch your projectiles further**, by walking towards the enemy when shooting.\n- **Keep distance!**. Try to stay outside the opponent's fire range and shoot them from afar.\n- **Keep spare parts in your inventory**, you will probably lose a lot, so it's always good to have some replacements.\n- SPD - Speed\n- JMP - Jump\n- HP  - Health\n- DMG - Damage\n- RNG - Range\n- RLD - Reload speed\n- BLS - Bullet speed\n\n--------------------------\n\n**Controls:**\n\n**A** and **D** - Movement\n\n**SPACE** - Jump\n\n**LEFT** and **RIGHT MOUSE** - Attack\n\n--------------------------","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f90/4/z/223e7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/dont-bet-your-life-away","author":{"name":"jandourek","uid":16543,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f90/4/z/1ae24.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/jandourek"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f90/4/z/223e5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//f90/4/z/223e5.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1drrDRD-W1a04S_VStE1dM0KI9M5F2wel/view?usp=sharing"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eznWpMGh29iLTmkxNQ7bNvg_OaASYPpL"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cQ722T3mSm_bTIxC8bf633usT7Vost4Q"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Money is Time","category":"jam","description":"Pay with your time and you might get lucky :)!![Unbenannt-12.jpg](///raw/962/52/z/21d9a.jpg)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//962/52/z/21d99.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/mones-is-time","author":{"name":"BIOBOOSTERPIXEL","uid":152169,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//962/52/z/21d5d.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/bioboosterpixel"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//962/52/z/21d9a.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//962/52/z/21d9a.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://corpushypercubus.itch.io/money-is-time"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Where Is My Liver","category":"jam","description":"A simple game by a simple man.

You are the only (and lonely) survivor.\nAll your technology has been destroyed.\n\nYou were able to put some parts together to create anew exo skeleton robot but\nbatteries went low quickly so you needed to attach a nuclear core.\nUnfortunatley that one emits a lot of radiation when under heavy duty so\ndon't put it under too much load. You will pay with your life.\n\n* Code: Alex\n* Graphics: Jan, Marie\n\nGame crafted from about 10 liters energy, 3 liters beer and\na few more liters of water mixed with pizza. Much pizza.\n\n\n# How to play\nThe game supports controllers (not in menu) and Keyboard/Mouse.\nIn settings screen you can setup the camera movement speed. This is important to know as movement is optimized for mouse by default. Speed it up for controller! If you pull the sliders to the left half the axis will get inverted.\n\nGameplay: Build towers to kill the aliens. The enemies will target and chase you. You can't run away. Each few waves enemies become stronger and faster.\nThe game runs until you are dead. Every wave you will get a small heal.\nWarning: You will lose life when building/upgrading towers or using shortcuts!\n\nNow drop into the game and have some fun :)\n\nFound any bugs? Report them in the comments. We love too hear your opinion!\n\n# Known Issues\n- Sound is hearable too far. We were not able to fine tune this as of time missing.

Oh, did I mention that instead of boring money, You will be playing for the years of your life?\n ![t≈ÅO2.png](///raw/4c6/c/z/231b3.png)\n\nHow to play:\n\nFirst choose how much You want to bet by pressing LMB on coins in the bottom part of screen. The number below this coins shows amount of coins You have. ![Coinstack6.png](///raw/4c6/c/z/2326c.png)\nNumber of coins in the middle shows the bet size.\n\nWhen You're done with bets press LMB on this emblem to start a game.![Emblem2.png](///raw/4c6/c/z/232dc.png)\nIn this game there are 4 types of cards (which are shown on emblem) and each card has its own power value. The goal of the game is to have more card points on the table than the opponent. You can view your cards power by simply putting your mouse over one of your cards. To pick up a card press and hold LMB then drag to your desired place. The places where You can put your card will green sides as shown on the picture below. ![Card background 2 oN.png](///raw/4c6/c/z/233ba.png)\nYou are always able to put your cards on any of your side of the table, but You can also destroy your opponents cards (your card will also get destroyed). But to destroy your opponent cards, your card needs to be specific Type (Fire card can destroy ice cards, ice can destroy water and water can destroy fire). There is also a fourth type of card: Ground type. Ground cards cannot destroy any other cards and can be destroyed by all the rest of types, but they work as shields: To be able to destroy fire, ice or water cards, all shields must be destroyed first. All of that is shown on the emblem.![Emblem2.png](///raw/4c6/c/z/234f8.png)\n\nIn your turn You have 2 moves. When You want to end your turn simply press LMB on the emblem. In the each bet there are 4 turns (2 are yours and 2 are AI turns), after 4 turns bet ends and bet is won by player who have more power points (The amount of your points is shown above your placed cards). After that You are back to placing bets.![t≈Ço3.png](///raw/4c6/c/z/2359c.png)\n\nI know that rules might be a bit complicated, but I hope You'll still enjoy it.

Defeating them all will grant your soul pardon and allow you to live a happy life once again.\n\n## Game Mechanics\n\nThe game is a 2D platformer in which your life total - souls - can be traded for at a merchant. The merchant will trade you other souls which grant you special powers. Until you lose them, that is, by taking damage from evil creatures in the castle.\n\n## How to Play\n\nUse **Arrow keys to move**\n\nUse **X to attack**\n\nUse **Space to interact** (doors & merchant)\n\n> In the merchant GUI, use the mouse to get souls from the merchant (bottom) in exchange for yours (top). You can also use the top screen in the merchant GUI to reorder your souls.

You win when your opponent's health turns down to zero.\n\nShuffle your deck and take 4 cards from it.\n\nIn the beginning of the turn take a card from your deck. Now you can put one creature on a table (order matters, so choose wisely) _and/or_ use one of your action cards. When you're done, just say \"pass\" (if no-one answers, try clicking \"end turn\").

Reaping Riches is a fast-paced bullet-hellish game in which Gold is everything. You get gold by collecting it scattered throughout the level or taking it from your slain foes. You use gold to pay your way past toll gates. You use your gold as a weapon to defeat monsters. Gold is the source of your life, and if you run out of it, you die. Play as some grim reaper looking guy on a hoverboard as you shoot through tons of enemies and crush (two) giant bosses in your quest to do... nothing, really.\n\np.s.

Chrome is a bit finnicky with controllers, but Firefox seems to be fairly reliable.

So here's a quick rundown of what you need to do:\n* Pick up a Dorothy XL Gatling gun. They look like this: \n\n![gatling.PNG](///raw/91/z/237d1.png)\n* Shoot The Beast, which can be found near the middle of the map\n* Every two shots, the gatling gun is junk and needs to be replaced.\n* The Beast's attacks will **instantly kill you**. Stay behind buildings.\n* You will instantly lose if The Beast is not shot at least once per round.\n* Once Shiki does her magic, all that's left to do is gun it down using normal attacks without getting yourself killed.\n\n#### Known bugs\nControllers don't work in all browsers. Firefox seems to be fairly good at working (Tested with an Xbox 1 wireless controller). Chrome seems to be good at knowing a controller is attached, and bad at actually forwarding input. No idea on other browsers.\n\n#### Credits/Technologies\n* Code: @fireslash\n* Art/story: @kiririn51\n* Music: [Zircon](http://zirconmusic.com/)\n\nSFX from: [Syna-Max](https://freesound.org/people/Syna-Max/), [unfa](https://freesound.org/people/unfa/), and [wangshoukun](https://freesound.org/people/wangzhuokun/)\n\nWritten in Haxe; while dragging Heaps along, kicking and screaming the whole way. \n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//91/z/23584.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/headless","author":{"name":"FireSlash","uid":25,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//91/z/1ee73.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/fireslash"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//91/z/237a2.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//91/z/237a2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//91/z/237d1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//91/z/237d1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://comeonandsl.am/dev/LD44/"},{"label":"Other","url":""}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Golden Galaxy","category":"jam","description":"Golden Galaxy is a \"Space Invaders\" type of game, in which you are required to defeat waves of enemies and proceed until you reach final boss.\n\n![scr1.png](///raw/d35/61/z/2295d.png)\n\nYour ship is powered by gold (Which comes in satchels and coins) and taking damage will remove one piece of it.

I create a super-hexagon clone, changing the chosen theme for something a little bit different - your life is (con)currency. In computer science, **_concurrency_** refers to the ability of different parts of a program or algorithm to be executed in partial order, without affecting the final outcome. In my project there is only code - some procedural generation for shapes and stripes - no sprite, no prefab, no physics, no implicite value (excepted a radius PI). I optimized each part of code so as to reach the lowest execution using a simple (but efficient) pooling system and an improved implementation of coroutine. Also I use a leaderboard on-line so as to save best scores. This way all players can rival with others. Of course, like in the original game, the main gameplay is really really hard, but with training you can reach some good score and skill.

You can put together change in your sleep. **CURRENCIES ARE YOUR LIFE**.\n\nYep, it‚Äôs a cashier simulator.\n\n### How to play ###\n\n![0 instr.png](///raw/78c/31/z/23b82.png)\nWhen a new customer arrives, you have to react fast! The longer the person waits, the less time bonus you will get.\n\n![1 instr.png](///raw/78c/31/z/23b83.png)\nThe customer's money appears on the plate. The display shows the amount of money that you have to return.

You may clean up the plate, but you don't have to. Let's see how this turns out otherwise... \n\n![3 instr.png](///raw/78c/31/z/23b86.png)\nPlace the change money on the customer's hand and click confirm. The customer doesn't accept less money, but more money is okay. Rounding up is the easy and quick way, but be careful, that'll give you a point deduction!\n\n![4 instr.png](///raw/78c/31/z/23b88.png)\nIf you're running out of change coins, request more! Whops, what a mess. I hope there's enough coins of the type that you were looking for.\n\n![5 instr.png](///raw/78c/31/z/23b89.png)\nArgh! The line of customers grew and it got out of hand! **You loose if there are >12 customers waiting**.\n\n### Rules ###\n- You will earn 100 Points for each customer\n- If you are fast enough (<20 sec) you will get a bonus\n- If you are not careful and return too much money, the difference will be taken from your score\n- If the line of customers grows too large the game will end\n- Place the change in the customers hand by dragging the coins to it and click \"Confirm\"\n- If you run out of coins, click \"Get more change money\"\n\n![BlogEntry.png](///raw/78c/31/z/23baa.png)\n\n### About us ###\nThis is **our second jam together** and we decided on some experiments this time. We first changed roles! **The artist was doing the code work and the programmer the art work**.\n\nWe also tried out an unusual (at least for games) technology for implementation: Microsoft WPF + C#. You can see the result for yourself üòÖ. We also did sound recording for the first time, but sadly due to time we didn't add a background music. \n\nWe used the following tools: Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Community, Affinity Photo, Quick Time Player (for sound recording).\n\n### Hints and Known bugs ###\n- The game looks best in a window of size 1440 x 900. The window can be resized.\n- The drag and drop functionality is a bit buggy. Even if this contradicts with the aim of the game, we recommend medium mouse-drag speed üòÖ.\n- (to be continued, **let us know in the comments!**)\n\n**Have fun trying out the game!!

The only thing standing between you and that book is a dungeon filled with guards, trying to keep that precious book away from the wrong hands.\n\nSadly, your powers are still weak, and wielding such dark magic creates a huge burden in your own humanity, as bringing back something from the death requires a high price. Not everything's lost though, as you are well familiar with the other schools of magic, proficient in the _art of healing_, and dangerous with the power of _firebolts_. \n\nUse these powers wisely, as the sole fuel of them are other human souls...\n\n## Some Screenshots\n\n![Image 1.png](///raw/ed6/z/234b5.png)\n\n![Image 2.png](///raw/ed6/z/234b7.png)\n\n## Controls\n- **Right Click** to move the mage\n- **Left Click** to cast fireball\n- **Space** to summon a skeleton\n- **A/D** to move camera around the player\n- **Mouse wheel** to zoom in and out\n- **C** to heal (uses one available skeleton for summoning).\n\n## How to Play\nFind your way to the Portal at the end of every level to advance in your quest.\n\n### A little bit about the game...\nGraphic assets were all brought from the asset store, so we opted out of the Graphics category, becase it just wouldn't be fair... Anything else, such as music kindly made by @Fran198, is made in the actual 72 hours of the Jam event.\n\n- @frankitox16 : Programming/Development\n- @Fran198 : Music/Art\n\nHope you enjoy it!\n\n**Note:** Windows executable is highly recommended, as the Web version might run out of memory while generating the map. If you just want a feel for the game or just don't want to download it, be aware that bugs may appear in the Web version (just refresh the page until it works...)\n\n## UPDATE 1\nList of bugfixes:\n- Lighting is improved. Now you can actually see behind those shadows!\n\n**Before**\n![Image 1.png](///raw/ed6/z/249a7.png)\n\n**After**\n![Update 1.png](///raw/ed6/z/249aa.png)\n\n- Loading screen now's working as it should (It's used to avoid that camera flickering at the beggining).\n- Lowered music volume as it was too high.\n- Skeletons now fight the enemy that was hit by a fireball, if they weren't attacking before.\n- Added particles to fireballs when they collide with an object to provide more feedback on the player when it's attacking an enemy\n- Enemies were nerfed. (Needs a bit more playtesting, as I find them a bit too easy. I'll probably do a balance patch later).","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ed6/z/23530.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/the-necromancer-saga-endless-dungeons","author":{"name":"frankitox16","uid":1758,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/frankitox16"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ed6/z/234b5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ed6/z/234b5.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ed6/z/234b7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ed6/z/234b7.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ed6/z/249a7.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ed6/z/249a7.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ed6/z/249aa.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ed6/z/249aa.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/f-montanari/ludum-dare-44"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GmiG944hGHtkkJkeHrUgLWFlIxlkvmI7"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://frankitox16.itch.io/necromancer-saga-endless-dungeons"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Adventures of Crimson Warlock","category":"jam","description":"Hello there player!!\n\nWe are proud to present you our first ever Ludum Dare entry, Adventures of Crimson Warlock, where you play as a warlock using blood magic to defeat anyone standing in his way.

This strength is visualized in a line chart as follows.\n\n![currency_strength.png](///raw/cd5/32/z/226f5.png)\n\nThe strength of a currency constantly varies between the values 0 and 100 and directly impacts the prowess of your player character in the arena.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n\nYou and other currencies move around in an arena, firing bullets and dodging enemy projectiles. Besides regular movement, you can also utilize a dash skill to surprise your opponent.\n\nThe strength of your weapons and your own armor scales in real time with the currency strength. The current timepoint is highlighted with a white vertical line and you can see some seconds into the future to plan your next strategic steps.\n\nIt is also possible to change your currency. This is possible in one of the exchange stops which are spread over the map. When you switch to a better currency, you will loose health (but gain weapon strength and armor) - switching to a worse currency will increase your health but lower your strength and armor. But keep in mind that the currencies values keep changing! However, you will keep the health you gained.\n\nThe game always uses three player characters, each playing as an individual currency. In the main menu, you can define how many of them are controlled by humans. You can only change to other currencies which are not already taken by other players.\n\n**Hint: When you play the game for the first time, you should definitely start it in three players mode** - even when you want to play alone. The AI is quite powerful and would most likely frustrate you when you directly fight against it. In your next rounds, you can decrease the number of human players to two such that the AI takes over a single player character. If you feel prepared enough after some training, you can switch to the true single player mode.\n\n### Available Weapons\n\nThere are three freely changeable weapon types. Their basic properties are listed below.\n\n| Name        | Fire rate           | Range  | Damage |\n| ------------- |:-------------:|:-----:|:-----:|\n| Minigun | high | low | low |\n| Laser | medium | infinite | medium |\n| Crossbow | very low | infinite | very high |\n\n## Controls\n\nThe game contains three player characters, each of them can be controlled either by a human player or an (not very intelligent) AI.\n\n### Human players\n\n#### Player 1\n* Movement: W, A, S, D\n* Aim: Relative mouse position\n* Shoot: Left mouse button\n* Dash: Right mouse button\n* Change weapon: Tab\n\n#### Player 2 and 3\n\nBoth of them expect controller input signals.\n\n* Movement: Controller left stick\n* Aim: Controller right stick\n* Shoot: R2\n* Dash: L1, R1\n* Change weapon: L2\n\n## Used technologies and resources\n\nThe game was created with the [godot engine](https://godotengine.org/).\n\n**Additional utilized software solutions**\n\n* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/de/) for the splash screen\n* [Gimp](https://www.gimp24.de/) for backgrounds / simple graphic modifications\n* [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) for very simple tile graphics\n* [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/downloads.html) to generate the player and cash exchange station graphics\n* [Ableton Live 10](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/) for sound effect creation\n\n## Used third-party assets\n\n**Sounds**\n\n* [Cash register sample](https://freesound.org/people/kiddpark/sounds/201159/)\n\n**Fonts**\n\n* [Noto Mono](https://www.google.com/get/noto/)\n* [Cash Currency Font](https://www.dafont.com/cash-currency.font)\n\n\n## Contributors\n\nThis project was created within 72 hours by [jcklie](https://ldjam.com/users/jcklie/), [mbugert](https://ldjam.com/users/mbugert/) and [tomatenbrei](https://ldjam.com/users/tomatenbrei/).\n\n## Gameplay video\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydjk-2oP6GQ\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cd5/32/z/222dd.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/cash-clash","author":{"name":"tomatenbrei","uid":144860,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cd5/32/z/23cb1.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/tomatenbrei"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cd5/32/z/226ef.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cd5/32/z/226ef.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cd5/32/z/226e6.gif.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cd5/32/z/226e6.gif"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//cd5/32/z/226f5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//cd5/32/z/226f5.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://github.com/jcklie/ludum-dare-44"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://tomatenbrei.itch.io/cash-clash#download"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://tomatenbrei.itch.io/cash-clash#download"},{"label":"Other","url":""}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Rich Robots","category":"jam","description":"![30-04-2019_03-46-31.png](///raw/e50/f1/z/2355a.png)\n\nFight against hoardes of robots to get their money. \n\nThe money can be used for grenades but it also represents your health.\n\nDue to the fact that i was alone and didn't had that much time i wasn't able to implement everything i had planned.

There is a lot information online about it, you can even use an online simulation to see how it behaves. \n - Especially [this list of patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns) can be useful.\n - It always takes one heart to kill a slime, as they will attack you when you are on an adjacent tile. Just move into them to actually kill them. (Skeletons will take two hits to kill)\n - You can Drag & Drop items and coins from chests and bags into your inventory.\n - Your inventory contains items and coins. \n   - Items can be re-arranged by dragging and dropping them.\n   - Coins can only be placed initially in your inventory, then they simulate one step of Conway's Game of Life every step you take.\n   - Items count as dead cells for the simulation.\n   - The potion and the sword can be double clicked to use them. The potion will turn all surrounding items and coins in the inventory to hearts. The sword will cause you to attack all enemies within 2 tiles range.\n - The most effective strategy is to use potions to convert a bunch of coins into a lot of hearts.\n\n![conways_currency_2.png](///raw/d33/z/23278.png)\n\n([Fonts are by Eeve Somepx](https://somepx.itch.io/humble-fonts-free))","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d33/z/231ba.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/conways-currency","author":{"name":"klianc09","uid":829,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/klianc09"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//d33/z/23278.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//d33/z/23278.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hy5f3cv85evttew/conways_currency-desktop-1.0.jar?dl=1"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hy5f3cv85evttew/conways_currency-desktop-1.0.jar?dl=1"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hy5f3cv85evttew/conways_currency-desktop-1.0.jar?dl=1"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["desktop","java"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Against The Ninja","category":"jam","description":"*Top down 2D Ninja Vs Demons Action !*\n\nYou're a ninja fighting his last fight against the endless hordes of hell, and you need to survive for as long as you can and get the highest score.

The levels are randomly generated.\n\nControls\n\nWASD - move, also french in Post-LD\n\nLEFT/RIGHT - turn\n\nSPACE - attack (claim soul)\n\nThe game was programmed in Go using Vulkan (vulkan-go).\nGLFW is used for windowing. It uses my own engine, Gorium.\n\nVulkan is very hardware-specific, so any bug reports are appreciated. The terrain generator sometimes produces geometry that makes the already bouncy physics hiccup. The Post-LD version (only bugfixes) doesn't have these problems.\n\nYou need working Vulkan drivers to play the game\n\nPost-mortem:\nhttps://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/worked-to-death/doing-ludum-dare-with-vulkan","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//138/1/z/23223.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/worked-to-death","author":{"name":"ronin748","uid":6193,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//138/1/z/1ffe8.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/ronin748"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//138/1/z/237d4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//138/1/z/237d4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://roninkoi.itch.io/worked-to-death"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/Roninkoi/LD44"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/126x60uk6ln28mx/LD44.zip?dl=0"},{"label":"Other","url":""}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"LifeMutation","category":"jam","description":"***********************************************************************\n                        Eat blobs.

But he has to travel trough the dangerous Dog Nebula and defeat or evade enemies and bullits.\n\nAt the start of the game he can choose how to outfit his spaceship. As a cat he has 9 lives which he can trade for credit with which he can buy bullitpacks and shields. The idea is, you can buy the stuff to fit your preferred playing style.\n\nThe game was made in 3 days in 6502 assembly. All code and graphics were made in those 3 days. Most of the time was spent in debugging, though :)\n\nThe music was made a few years before by Roel and is used with his permission. He also made the few sound effects the game has. The Cat character is based on an idea by Ingeborg.\n\nBecause I spend so many time on a few stubborn bugs, I didn't have time to tweak the gameplay, so the game is not balanced. Lucky for you that means it's a very easy game.\n\nThe game has no restart facility (which isn't that bad, because at the moment replay value is pretty limited) (just rerun or press F5 if playing in a browser).\n\n## Controls\nOn a C64, you need a joystick in port 1.\nOn the Vice emulator or the first mentioned online emulator: Use keys on the Numpad and Space. (8=up, 2=down, 4=left, 6=right, SPACE=fire). \nIf you have downloaded an emulator yourself (like Vice), you may have to change the joystick settings.\n* In the buying menu use up and down to select, left and right to decrease or increase amount. Fire to fly off\n* In-game Up activates shield, down deactivates shield, left and right for steering and fire to fire your bullits.\n\nThe playing field uses only the leftmost 256 pixels (which is considered a bit of a cop-out in C64 circles).\n\n## Running the game\nThe best way to play it would be on a Real C64, but that would be difficult for most people. Second best is an emulator running on an Desktop or Laptop. Running the game in a browser demands a decent Desktop/Laptop. Running on a mobile in the browser is not adviced.\n\nAn emulator that is available for Windows, Mac and Linux is VICE. Link to the VICE site: (http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/index.html#download). \nYou can drag the game file 'main.prg' on the executable to run the game. You may have to change the joystick settings in the menu. The game uses joystick in Port 1. I've also included a zipped windows version that is stripped to just the C64 emulator and has a batch file that you can click to run the game (it does the joystick setting for you).\n\nIf you don't like to download an emulator or can't use that version, there are online options:\n### Playing Online\n* https://ib-goerp.nl/c64/emulated/\nChrome demands some user interaction before AudioContext is allowed to start. Therefore you must click the button below to start the program.\nAfter clicking the script will be loaded and the game will automatically start.\n\nThis online version emulates a C64 with Vice.js, which is made by R. Janicek link to a demo sitelink to the repo. Vice.js is a javascript port of the great Vice EmulatorLink to the VICE site.\n\nI changed the settings of Vice.js so it emulates joystick port 1 using the Numpad Keys. According to Vice documentation, the Numpad '0' key should work as Fire button, but on my computer it didn't work, so I changed the game so it would use Joystick in port 1 and set Vice to emulate that joystick port on the numpad. That way the SPACE key can be used as fire (who would have thought that the C64's crosstalk between joystick and keyboard would come in handy 37 years later, he?).\n\n* https://c64emulator.111mb.de/index.php?site=pp_javascript&lang=en&group=c64\nIt's another good online emulator\nDownload the game from the Ludum Dare page, and upload it to the emulator page (on the drop file and play, part). Set Joystick in the dropdown to 'Joystick Keyboard 2-> Player2' to be able to use Cursor keys and Space to control the ship.\n\n## Version\nI've made three changes since the first upload: I changed the joystick port so I could get it to run online and I fixed two major bugs: \n* a bug that always changed the lifes you had at the start to 9 (therby defeating the whole idea of the game)\n* a bug that prevented enemies turning up (making the game even MORE boring).\n\n## Bugs left\nThere are still plenty of bugs left. A few notable bugs:\n* score isn't working\n* collision detection with enemies isn't working\n* enemies freeze from time to time\n* you can't see how for you've progressed\n\nIf you've found another bug, please let me know in the comments\n\n![2019-04-29 (2).png](///raw/73a/z/224df.png)![2019-04-28 (2).png](///raw/73a/z/224e6.png)\n![2019-04-29 (1).png](///raw/73a/z/224ed.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//73a/z/22480.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/alien-easter-cat","author":{"name":"goerp","uid":2615,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/goerp"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//73a/z/224df.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//73a/z/224df.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//73a/z/224e6.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//73a/z/224e6.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//73a/z/224ed.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//73a/z/224ed.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Commodore 64","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/uhit36repa2m2gf/main.prg?dl=0"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://gitlab.com/sipke/lifecurrency"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://ib-goerp.nl/c64/emulated/"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/zjrqykxqz0abh5u/WinVICE-2.4-x86-stripped.zip?dl=0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Rainbow Rampage - Twitch Overlay Game","category":"jam","description":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzOHwHEmOUw\n\n_In the near future, Halloween has been banned.

To help ensure that you don't just stumble into an empty room, I've taken a \"one room, one server, one region\" approach.\n- Many commands are disabled when no match is setup. On the other hand, before matching you can WASD around the game area, which is not possible during matches.\n- This game uses keyboard input. Some of the basic commands: move forward, look left, look up, look down, cam up, cam down, shoot (you can see the full list, except hidden commands, in the banner at the top of the game view!)\n- Share your tips/discoveries on the game forum (via itch.io)\n- If you type smileys, they will appear in the digital display above brainy (really)\n- Because this game includes a chat function, I kindly recommend that you play it with a parent so you don't get upset or to minimize exposure to bad language. Seriously.\n\n*Parting shot*\n\nThis game is a branch of Project Neo, a framework which I cleaned up and pushed to Github when LD44 started. You can find the source and media here:\n\nhttps://github.com/eelstork/Neo/tree/br2112\n\nLicensed media (sound) aren't made available. Also, I do not include a list of profanities used by the chat filter. Other than that, you are welcome to look around the project and derive works from this. I'll consolidate the license later, but for now, the general idea is: derivative works okay; plagiarism... not okay : D\n\nI hope you will enjoy this game!

This is because dreamlo doesn't work with the WebGL build.\nI don't know the exact reason but it had something to do that http links don't work.\n\n\n**This is my first time I've entered a game jam and first time I \"finished\" a game. Feedback is appreciated :smile: **\n\n\"Currencies of Life\" is about the three main currencies in life:\nMoney, TIme and Health.\n\nThe goal of the game is to make sure you don't lose any of the three currencies for as long as possible.\nThe longer you survive the higher your score. \nLosing any currency is GAME OVER!\n\n\n**HOW TO PLAY**\n\nWalking with WASD\nYou aim with your mouse and left-mousebutton to shoot\n\n\n**MONEY**\n\nYou start with 100$, and when you kill an enemy you get 6$. But every time you shoot you spend 5$. So choose your shots wisely and don't just spam.\n\n\n**HEALTH**\n\nYou start with 10 health, every time you get hit by an enemy your health will decrease by 1.\n\n\n**TIME**\n\nYou start with 60 seconds, you have two ways to manipulate time.\n\n\nHolding down L-Control will increase the timer by one second every two seconds. However this will also speed up enemies and their spawn time. Try to hold L-Control as much as possible to prevent the timer from running out.\n\n\nIf you're in a bad situation you can hold L-Shift to make all enemies move slower, while you move faster. But beware this will make your timer go down twice as fast.\n\n\n**POWERUPS**\n\nThere are three different kinds of powerups which spawn every 20 seconds in a random spot.\n\n\nMoney - Will increase your money by 15\n\n\nHealth - Will increase your health by 1\n\n\nTime - WIll increase your timer by 5 seconds\n\n\n**SCORE**\n\nThere are a couple of ways you can increase your score.\n\n\nEvery seconds that passes your score will increase by 1, when you hold L-Control the score will increase faster.\n\n\nFor every enemy you kill your score will increase by 1.\n\n\nFor every powerup you pick up your score will increase by 15.\n\n\n**SCOREBOARD**\n\nThere is a public scoreboard at the game over screen. If you want to enter your score, type in your name after you're game over and your score will be sent to the scoreboard.\n\n\nThe scoreboard only shows the top 10, so if you're not on there you should try again ;)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//f19/42/z/22c1d.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/currencies-of-life","author":{"name":"Bartman","uid":149791,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/bartman"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://bartman-art.itch.io/currencies-of-life"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://bartman-art.itch.io/currencies-of-life"},{"label":"Other","url":""}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Heart Sacrifice","category":"jam","description":"First game I made for Ludum Dare. Hope you like it and comment if you have the time. \n\nEDIT: Link now works. \n\nI made a mistake when posting on itch. Accidentaly posted it as private instead of public game. I'm very sorry about that and hope you can play it now!\n\nEDIT 2: I tried fixing the blue slime error and I think I did. Yesterday I rushed to post the game so I didn't test it at all that's why there were errors. I updated the download file and it is now called version 1.0.1. The error appeared very rarely for me during testing (about once in about every 10 test plays) and now it didn't appear at all. I will continue the testing and see if there are any more errors (I hope there aren't). Thanks for reporting the error messages, they helped me a lot.\n\nAlso, not many people have realized that there is a dash mechanic (which you have to unlock).\nYou can get it if you have 7 full lives then click on the icon in the middle of the map. Once you do that you can press \"C\" on your keyboard to dash.\n\nThat is the reason the game is called Heart Sacrifice. You have to sacrifice your health to be able to get dash ability thus the gameplay feels faster and also it's way easier to dodge enemy fireballs. Originally, I was supposed to make a statue in the middle instead of that icon but I didn't have time to do so since I didn't work on the first day of the jam, only on the second and third.\n\n![dsadassd.png](///raw/568/52/z/23148.png)\n\n![Screenshot.png](///raw/568/52/z/23d18.png)\n\n![Screenshot2.png](///raw/568/52/z/23d2a.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//568/52/z/23d37.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/heart-sacrifice-1","author":{"name":"Predrag","uid":153701,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/predrag"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//568/52/z/23148.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//568/52/z/23148.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//568/52/z/23d18.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//568/52/z/23d18.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//568/52/z/23d2a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//568/52/z/23d2a.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://predrag.itch.io/heart-sacrifice"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Olaf's Adventure","category":"jam","description":"![screen2.PNG](///raw/4a5/8/z/22872.png)![screen3.PNG](///raw/4a5/8/z/22873.png)\n\n\n### Description\nThis game is a platformer shooter game.

It's about circulation and passing through. You have to keep it alive. You have to maintain it to keep its value. You have a very good maintainer, your brain. It does big amount of work in controlling your inner organs. How long could you stay alive if you take the its job?\n\n### Instructions\n\nThere are four stats (blood circulation, oxygen, water and nutrition). Your goal is to keep them above 0%.\n\n**Blood circulation** is maintained by the heart. Press **F** key repeatedly to make the heart beating.\n\nLevel of **oxygen** is increased when inhaling by holding **J** key, when you release it, the lungs exhale.\n\nWhen the **water** level decreases below 80%, the body will drink - the stomach fills with a water (but only if it's empty). To absorb the water, use the stomach, by pressing **K** key.\n\nThe most complex process is to obtain **nutrition**. You have to wait for the body to eat (nutrition level is below 80%). By pressing the **K** key, the stomach will digest the food. Digestive process has multiple phases. First the stomach has to fill with gastric acid, next it must churn multiple times until the food is fully digested. \n\n![stomach.png](///raw/31e/8/z/241b8.png)\n\nNutrition from digested food is absorbed mainly by using small intestine (pressing **D** key). This will create some amount of waste material in large intestine.\n\n![intestine.png](///raw/31e/8/z/241c1.png)\n\nLarge instestine is controlled by **S** key to move the waste material throuh it and absort remaining nutrition (smalled amount then small intestine).\n\n### Tools\n\n- Unity\n- Visual Studio Code\n- Inkscape\n- Gimp\n- Wikipedia (learning about bodily functions :D)\n- ScreenToGif (for making gifs)\n\n### Changelog\n\n- **2019-05-04**: Fixed time shown in score (was still showing game's total running time)\n- **2019-05-02**: Added link to updated version, where smashing all the buttons randomly won't keep you alive. You must keep the frequency of heart beats in certain limits and use deeper breaths using lungs. **Remember you should rate the original version.**\n- **2019-05-01**: Time reset after restart, ox**i**gen typo\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//31e/8/z/23124.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/stay-alive","author":{"name":"Richard Jedlicka","uid":36371,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/richard-jedlicka"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//31e/8/z/24183.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//31e/8/z/24183.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//31e/8/z/241b8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//31e/8/z/241b8.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//31e/8/z/241c1.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//31e/8/z/241c1.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://uiii.itch.io/stay-alive-ludum-dare-44"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://uiii.itch.io/stay-alive"},{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/uiii/ld44"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"BetYourLife","category":"jam","description":"TEASER\n\n\nWe created a short teaser for our game and uploaded it on YouTube.

PC version will be android port if trying it out before you install it on your phone seems more convicing. Each player (from 2 to 8) gets his own revolver and uses it to bet his life.

He comes now to collect but you've made a deal with him:   Sacrifice other peoples' souls in place of yours.  In order to live as long as possible,  you must release a  plague onto the world which feeds your health.  Each round of the clock, the Devil steals a bit more of your soul.  How long can you survive?\n\n![PlagueMachine2.PNG](///raw/8aa/91/z/23007.png) \n\nCities has different characteristics and populations counts.  Each City has weaknesses that can be exploited through careful positioning of your plague Spores and by upgrades their potency through Mutation purchases.\nThe game is part simulation,  part RPG, and part Mancala. \n\n![PlagueMachine3.PNG](///raw/8aa/91/z/2300d.png)\n\nA tour of the HUD: Top left is the currently selected City name and population total.  Under that, the City's population breakdown by age group.  Clicking the arrow under the graph will pull out the City's Stats.  The bottom left is your Plague Spore information for the selected City.  The middle three buttons are for pulling up the Mutations window (the skull), then Navigating and zooming (the arrows and dot), then selecting the Attack option (the bullseye) to move your Plague Spores to nearby Cities.  The area on the right will pop out the Mutations window for you to buy upgrades and to see your Plague's Stats.  The top right is your Health and the Revolving Timer.\n\nEach round of the Revolving Timer, calculations are done for 1) Plague Destruction, Population Death, Population Birth, and Plague Death. These are all rolled up into a final addition to or removal of your Health. The Devil's Damage is also subtracted from this value and will increase drastically as the game goes on.\n\nThe controls are simply to move your spores by using the using the bullseye button at the bottom of the screen.  You will move a percentage of your Spores from the selected City to the next City you click on (if it's within distance). Don't forget to purchase upgrade Mutations to battle the ever resistant Cities.  Each purchase increases drastically at the cost of your Health.  \n\n**The Plague Stats Overview:**\n- Critical Population - The maximum amount of Spores you can have on an individual City\n- Damage - How much death you inflict on a City per Spore\n- Diversity - How much your Plague resists a City's adaptation over time to your infestation\n- Growth - How quickly your Spores multiply when feeding off the death they've caused\n- Mobility - The percentage of Spores that will get transferred when attacking another City\n- Rampup - The amount of Efficiency gained per Revolving Timer\n- Sacrifice - The percentage of souls that are fed back to your Health from the Plague's destruction\n- Upkeep Cost - The cost to keep the Plagues under your control.\n- Zeal - The initial Efficiency of your Plague Spores after attacking a new City.\n\n**This City Stats Overview:**\n- Carry Capacity - The maximum population of a City\n- Growth - How quickly the population grows\n- Intelligence - How quickly the City adapts to the Plague once infested\n- Virility - How many Children are born to Adults and Retired City Dwellers\n- Community - How well Children and Elderly are protected from Plague damage\n- Technology - The always increasing resistance to the Plague even when not infested\n\nThis game was solo developed and made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 44.

For this one, I (the dad) was out of town for work at the beginning of the Ludum Dare and was, therefore, not able to participate in the planning stage or the beginning of development. My oldest son had to take over most of my responsibilities as the programmer, and I joined in when I got back. Most of the work on this entry was done by my sons and the friend. I only implemented a couple of of systems and did some bug fixing (and probably missed a few...)

It's a timed precision platformer. Your healthbar represents the timer, and you can buy any power charges you want in exchange of a bit of health. Try to finish with the maximum health remaining!\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't have the time to add more levels, nor sounds, nor to polish. Maybe in the future! \n\n### How to play\n\nKeyboard and Gamepad are supported.\n\n- Move: Arrows | Left joystick\n- Jump: Space | (A) button\n- Dash: X key | (X) button.\n\n### Credits\n\n- *Design, programming, UI, animations*: Matthieu Golsenne\n- *Design, art*: Laetitia Payeur","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//eec/22/z/235aa.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/the-impossible-escape","author":{"name":"Marsheleene","uid":142574,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//eec/22/z/24302.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/marsheleene"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://marsheleene.itch.io/ld44"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://marsheleene.itch.io/ld44"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web","win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Time City","category":"jam","description":"Welcome to the time city, people usually use time to exchange money, but there is no way to exchange money for time.

We would highly appreciate your feedback!\n\nNote: We did everything from scratch. There were no pre-made assets used.\n\nPS: MULTIPLE PLAYTHROUGHS POSSIBLE :)\n\nSome Context (Spoiler Alert!):\nThe world faces Judgement Day. God and Satan are sending their legions over mankind to bring absolut destrucion. In the midst of this battle, you find yourself looking for a place to die. Resigned and disheartened, you wish to send one last prayer to receive closure.\n\nAs the universe will have it you are able to attain divine powers that enable you to fight against the apocalyptic armies. However, those powers take their toll on you, drain your life force and turn it into profit for the supreme deity everything returns to because after all: your life is just a currency. This is displayed in the game by transforming  your lost HP into coins that appear in the UI hourglass at the bottom left of the screen. You lose HP by either getting hit by an enemy or by simply being in the afore described divine form you received upon praying at the altar.\n\nYou have to decide which side you want to fight for and give your life in exchange. You may also beat the game by choosing neither of the two forces and instead remain a human being. Choose your own path.\n(This game can be played multiple times with different endings)\nYou shouldnt miss out on the epic boss fights ;)\n\n![screenshot2.png](///raw/7b0/32/z/2294c.png)\n![ScreenShot.png](///raw/7b0/32/z/2294e.png)\n\nControls:\n\nA , D -> walk\n\nShift -> fast walking\n\nW , S -> Flying\n\nLeft Mouse Button -> Attack\n\nF -> Interact\n\n\n\n<--------------------------------------------------------------->\n\n\nEDIT: Version 1.1 out NOW! with many bugs fixed listed here:\n\n-> The respawn now works. You can play the game multiple times until you find the ending that suits you best!\n\n-> The dialogs are now way faster and less annoying to deal with. No more waiting for the text to slowly appear one by one.\n\n-> The flying was a huge problem for most of you, and we, me and @marius-boenisch werent satisfied with that either. It wasnt supposed to be that way. But the stress at the end took its toll. However, now with V 1.1 flying feels way more intuitive and easier. You also dont fly with space anymore, but W for upwards and S for downwards. Check it out, there are some awesome boss fight at the end ;)\n\n\n-> You can finally skip the annoying cutscene at the beginning if you want to play over and over again!\n\n-> More good news considering combat and controls: The player now attacks in the direction the mouse cursor is facing.

Check below this post or in credits.txt for credits.\n\n~~The game can be found on [my website](http://picsofbread.com/ld44)~~ or below. Just extract the zip somewhere and run \"run.bat\" (for Windows) or \"run.sh\" (for Linux). No OSX support, sorry.\n\n**EDIT: my site is having issues, I switched to a Google drive link.**\n\nIf you're on Windows it may pop up a warning about SmartScreen. Just click more details, then run anyway.\n\nAlso, Avast! is a piece of garbage antivirus that will probably complain about it being a rare file or whatever, and not run it. Here's the [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file-analysis/YWE5MTNiYWY5MmRlNmRiOWJhYTgzM2I4YThhMzk2OTM6MTU1NjQ5Mjk2OQ==/detection) that shows it's clean.\n\nThe gameplay is explained as soon as you exit the title screen. That's all you get. It's much more fun to discover the game for yourself rather than have everything spoon-fed to you, right?\n\nThe controls are fairly simple. In the city view, left-click to place your selected building. Right-click erases buildings. Use the mouse-wheel to select a building.\n\nHopefully you have fun with the game!

If you use a potion you will heal before a fight takes place. Sometimes when using a potion you may notice your health not fill to max, this is due to the enemy hitting you right after you drink.

The blood is both your dept to pay and the very thing you need to spend to get more.\n\n## Controls\n\nW to go forward\nS to go backwards\nMouse to aim / change rotation\nLeft click to attack\n\n## Mobs\n\nBasic fish - Low HP, High blood drop rate, Quick snack\n![fish1.png](///raw/e4a/a1/z/23e08.png)\n\nSunFish - High HP, Medium blood drop rate, Tough as nails\n![sunfish.png](///raw/e4a/a1/z/23e09.png)\n\nSlimeFish - Medium HP, Low blood drop rate, Not as tasty\n![slime.png](///raw/e4a/a1/z/23e0a.png)\n\n## UI\n\nDue to limited time the only UI that exists is the instruction start, HUD, and game over screen. There was a plan to clone the UI we used for our LD43 game which includes a menu with usability controls, custom keybinds, graphics settings, etc. However, I (darkguardsman) only ended up having ~10 hours to work on the game due to other responsibilities. Future versions will include better UI elements if we continue.\n\n## Credits\n\n- Audio - Freesound.org\n- Coding - Darkguardsman\n- Design - Darkguardsman\n- Idea Starter - Graugger (who wished not to make an account to get credit)\n- Graphics - TrisAstral\n- Unity - For being easy to use\n\n## Issues/Limitations\n\nAI are super simple, they contain local avoidance to avoid each other and the player. However, have no actual logic to deal with getting stuck or collisions. So expect fish to be derpy in some cases\n\nPhysics can be touchy at times, especially if you rotate while next to a wall. This can cause your fish to flip through the air for a short burst. Not really an issue as it can be a fun mechanic, however, was not by design. \n\nAttack range is really close, you basically need to get your teeth right over the target.\n\n## Firsts\n- Working as a team (last 2 attempts were solo)\n- Included audio\n- Actual art\n- Level Building\n\n## Features we missed\n\n- UI - Would have loved to make a full menu, hud, etc\n- Enemies - Plan was to have several aggressive mobs (other vampire fish, electric eels, string rays)\n- Dangers - Plan was to have environmental dangers including sunlight, spikes, and falling objects\n- Levels - We ended up with 1 really rough demo level the goal was at least 3 simple levels with objectives\n- Upgrades - Spend blood to make your fish better\n- Power ups - activatable upgrades or one off upgrades that allowed interesting effects (slime fish, bat fish, dash, cloak)\n- Better AI - random pathing, environmental behavior like eating plants or sleeping, chase mechanics \n- Bleeding - Have fish bleed rather than dropping blood right away\n- Better graphics - blood drop effects, more enviromentals, etc","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e4a/a1/z/22da4.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/vampire-fish","author":{"name":"DarkGuardsman","uid":109134,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e4a/a1/z/18830.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/darkguardsman"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e4a/a1/z/23e06.jpg.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e4a/a1/z/23e06.jpg"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e4a/a1/z/23e07.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e4a/a1/z/23e07.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e4a/a1/z/23e08.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e4a/a1/z/23e08.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e4a/a1/z/23e09.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e4a/a1/z/23e09.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//e4a/a1/z/23e0a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//e4a/a1/z/23e0a.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Other","url":"https://github.com/DarkGuardsman/LD44-Vampire-Fish"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/DarkGuardsman/LD44-Vampire-Fish/releases/tag/0.1.0"},{"label":"macOS","url":"https://github.com/DarkGuardsman/LD44-Vampire-Fish/releases/tag/0.1.0"},{"label":"Linux","url":"https://github.com/DarkGuardsman/LD44-Vampire-Fish/releases/tag/0.1.0"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Cashteroids","category":"jam","description":"Made over the weekend of Ludum Dare 44!

But as with anything, time (ie your lifespan) is against you (a kind of currency?), so dont take forever!\n\n![Untitled-6_2.jpg](///raw/d6f/c/z/23cb8.jpg)\n\nIts certainly a very half-baked-and-broken version of the game I was envisioning, but a complete enough game to mess around in - with some elements Im pretty happy with! The boat physics, buoyancy, object dragging and wind system in particular turned out really well and I felt like the graphics developed nicely throughout the jam. The final 12 hours of the gamejam were a mad rush to implement the last few features needed to be anything close to playable and I spent a good deal of time building a bunch of unique, far-off islands to explore.\n\n![Screen01.jpg](///raw/d6f/c/z/2457c.jpg)\n\nI really havent had time to properly play-test much, but I know the distances between islands are likely too large. I wanted some level of epic scale to the game but there was meant to be more interesting content *on the way* to the outer islands, which I simply didnt get around to creating during the jam. \n\n30/04 Ive uploaded a minor updated version of the game to include some bug fixes to a few systems that were broken (re-spawning, death, music and wind etc) and brought the islands closer together (theyre still pretty far away tho)\n\n![Screen05.jpg](///raw/d6f/c/z/24580.jpg)\n\nIts super buggy, youre not guaranteed to get a new boat if the one you have gets ruined and be prepared to be as lost and confused as the main character!

The aim of the game is to destroy the enemy god by summoning your fighters to defend your portal, fight the hordes of enemies on the battlefield (lanes), and to sacrifice themselves at the enemies portal.\n\n### How To Play\n\n#### Fighters\nYou summon your fighters by typing their names and pressing enter. Your fighters are listed in the top left of the screen.  Summoning your fighters uses your life force.\n\n**Note:** Currently there are only two fighters available, Igor a lightweight melee fighter and Zoth a medium weight melee fighter. Future versions of BattleType will have additional fighters including ranged fighters and spell casters.\n\n#### Spells\nThe random words that appear in the top half of the screen are spells.  Type them in to summon them. Each spell you summon will increase you health.  The longer the spell the more health you will gain.\n\n#### Portals\nSummoned fighters enter the battlefield from the portal. Portals move every few seconds, providing fighters access to different lanes on which to fight and journey towards the opponents portal.  If a fighter reaches their opponents portal, they will sacrifice themselves, inflicting great damage to the opponent god.\n\n**Tip:** Protect your portal from the enemy fighters by keeping your lanes under control.\n\n\n### Release Notes\n\n#### Version 0.3.2\n- Fixed the crash to desktop bug that occurred randomly when summoning enemy fighters\n\n\n#### Version 0.3.1\n- Fixed crash when player fighter sacrifices themself at enemies portal.\n- Fixed restart bug when game ends\n- Fixed keyboard disable bug when restarting a game\n- Fixed sprite animation\n- Fix bug that prevented enemy medium fighter from spawning\n- Updated game balance\n- Updated Summoning textarea visibility\n- Updated End screen feedback\n- Updated enemy AI\n- Updated fighter attributes\n- Added game difficulty options\n- Added game stats to end screen\n- Added simple splash screen to stop users thinking game has crashed during loading\n- Added option to move portals up and down lanes using cursor up/down\n\n\n\n","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1a5/e/z/234c6.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/battletype","author":{"name":"Sebity","uid":58785,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/sebity"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//1a5/e/z/23583.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//1a5/e/z/23583.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"https://jtsceioa.itch.io/battletype"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Gaming for Life","category":"jam","description":"Penniless Billy wants a new videogame for his birthday.

He has a medium-sized property close to the woods. His life consists of his job and his free time, but maintaining a healthy work-life balance is more difficult than it seems.\n\n## Goal\n\nYour goal is to make it through as many days as possible without either losing your job or taking too little care of your non-work-life. There are quite a variety of options at hand which you can (or can not) take in order to bring balance into the two aspects of your life.\n\n## How to play\n\nUpon being thrown into the world you will be greeted by a tutorial bubble with basic information. Part of the fun is epxloring your possibilities by yourself, though, that's why we only slightly nudge you in the right directions with our tutorial bubbles, just so much that you don't feel lost. From time to time (and depending on where you navigate) the tutorial bubbles will appear and help you understand the different aspects of the game.\n\n## Controls\n\nMouse point & click for movement and actions\nEsc to open pause menu\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nWe ran into some issues while building for WebGL which caused a lot of features to mess up.

We weren't too fond of the theme but decided to stick through it and tackle the challenge. After about an hour of back and forth idea-tossing we came to the conclusion that we would handle the topic on a broader note, not hug it by its meaning. \n\nWe decided to make a game in which the player has to balance his work- and social life. We then started to come up with systems to affect the balance positively and negatively as well as ideas about the setting and look of the game.\nThat's where our first draft came to existence:\n\n![mockup.png](///raw/977/22/z/21d9f.png)\n\nWhen setting up our git repository we had to resolve an issue with the .gitignore file which caused our meta files to be ignored and therefore broke the main scene for Daniel to use (as it was set up by Chris). After just short of 2 hours, we finally found the culprit and could resume development. Continuing throughout the day we worked on the code-base. Chris concentrated on developing some core mechanics and making the base world model, while Daniel concentrated on making and scripting the UI and creating basic graphics.\nBy the end of the day we had a rough base to work with and went to sleep around 23:30 (CEST).\n\n### Day 2 \n\nWe met on discord at aound 8:00 in the morning (CEST) ans spent the following 16 hours each working on their own aspect of development. For Daniel this was mostly UI-related stuff and for Chris it meant working on various game features. Somewhere around early noon, we decided to merge our progress in order to test the cooperativity of our individual game building blocks.\n\nFirst impressions were good, but with the closing timeframe and each of us being unable to work on the game for a major part of day 3 meant we had to work harder.\n\n### Day 3\n\nOn day 3, still positive, we noticed that various features had stopped working together correctly and the more we trid to fix things, the more we saw our precious gem fall apart. We decided to save what was poassible to save and finish what we were able to finish.\n\n\n## Disclaimer\nWe ran into some issues while building for WebGL which caused a lot of features to mess up.

Of course, to keep the population in check you have to balance between their happiness and belief in you.

You need money to do anything. Reaching financial freedom is extremely challenging.\n\nYou are an indebted piggy bank with a couple of cents in your pocket. Useless expenses and countless bills don't let you get to investment opportunities and financial literacy. You have never been so far away from your dream of having 1000 coins deposited on your bank account. Or have you?\n\nUse what's left in your pockets to throw it in da face of pointless spending or avoid it all the way. But be carefull not to end up with empty pockets, since your life is literally money. Catch profitable investment opportunities to refill your budget. Borrow from the bank under crazy interest rates to prolong your suffering. Put your tough-earned coins on a deposit account to make them work for you while you are chilling around (and try not to waste money on useless stuff meanwhile). Any strategy counts as long as it puts you out of financial misery. Life stuff, huh?\n\n![intro_screen.png](///raw/35e/11/z/22554.png)\n\n### Manual\n\nBut really, the game is a combination of a space shooter-like and a financial simulator. Simple to get on track, hard to master.\n\nIn game you have two kinds of resources: cash (money) and bank account balance. You can freely move money between them, but keep in mind that negative bank balance will constantly drain your cash based on credit interest rate, while positive bank balance will add to your cash according to deposit interest rate. \n\nIt's okay to have negative bank balance as long as you can sustain it, but if your cash drops to zero - the game is over. That's life. On the other hand, you win when you can live of your interest, that is when your bank account deposit reaches 1000 coins. Get the highest score among your friends by sustaining the largest cash amount.\n\nWastefull expenses and countless invoices (redish stuff) will try to absorb you.

I can't write spaghetti code unfortunately for me, so it always takes forever to write anything..\n\nNow, on to Dissuasion.\n\nHumanity has discovered the technology to manipulate the lifetimes of people and creatures, and it is in years, days, hours, and minutes that goods and services are traded.\nHowever, all is not well. A monolithic world government called the Order tightly controls this currency, and the world is not well.\n\nAs an operative for the resistance, you infiltrate businesses and organizations, and spread propaganda from posts on the hypernet, the only safe haven for resistance communications.\nCan you get in and get out, making an impact and avoiding the Order police force?\n\n..I wish... we only ended up getting the bare minimum done, but it was a really interesting jam anyway!\nLeave a comment, and I'll definitely play and rate your games!\n\n**How To Play**\n\nSo.. after watching some of my siblings play-test this, I realized that I really need to put a quick overview of how NetCrawler works. NetCrawler is the app that you, as an operative, use to propagandize the organization you have infiltrated. Using a company connection to the hypernet, it pulls in posts and articles that its AI thinks might be relevant. Then, it's up to you to read them and decide whether or not they would serve as good propaganda tools. If so, press the Send button, and if not, the Reject button. It takes a bit of time to make its way around the company, and longer posts will take longer. However, the shorter posts potentially have less convincing power, so choose wisely. You can send several posts at a time, but they will build up in the queue, and only send one at a time.

No one remembers why it started. No one knows when it will end. Human lives are just another expendable resource here. Your goal is to win by capturing all important points before the enemy no matter what.\n\nAll art is done by Esus and all music is done by Cyber Night both of whom agreed to participate with me in Ludum Dare but don't have LD accounts.\n\nYour goal is to capture all 4 points on the map. To capture points end your turn while your soldiers are near the flag. The more soldiers you have on the point the faster it will be captured. Every turn each captured point gives you money. All units also drop money on death. You can spend money to hire new units.\n\nCamera is moved by A/D keys.\n\nSummary of all units in order of their appearence in the shop in the bottom left corner of the screen:\n1. Heavy - has most health. Unlike other characters can shoot multiple times on one turn but has to sacrifice his mobility until the end of the turn in order to do so.\n2. Good Boy - quickest unit in the game. Can bite enemies causing them to bleed until they are healed by medic or blow up explosives on it's back to destroy everything aroung including covers and walls. Doesn't count when capturing points.\n3. Sniper - more accurate on bigger distances. Can deal massive amounts of damage and gains even higher accuracy and damage when passes a turn without moving or shooting.\n4. Trooper - cheapest and weakest minion. Beats enemies with quantity, not quality.\n5. Engineer - can build extra defences for the point with his mines, covers and walls. His second ability is a hit with a wrench that can stun opponents causing them to skip next turn.\n6. Medic - heals units and cures their bleeding. Also has a pistol that can be used on short distances for offence.","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0df/c/z/22a27.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/pricelist","author":{"name":"Lamossus","uid":53200,"avatar_url":"","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/lamossus"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://lamossus.itch.io/pricelist"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Samurai Zombie Girl","category":"jam","description":"![Title.png](///raw/5c3/3/z/23113.png)\n\nYou're a samurai zombie girl, and you must regain your humanity and avoid dismemberment.\n\nBuy items from the flesh merchant, a strange man who will buy body parts from the other zombies you kill.

So its like a zombie puzzle game.\nIn order to go to that safe spot you need to run away from zombies by throwing body parts as a decoy to run away until you figure out the hide spot.\nYou should read the Rules before playing since i wanted to add more logic to it by not allowing you to do certain things if you cut the wrong body parts(ex:- no legs, no jump, etc..) \n\nIt was an amazing experience to join the Ludum Dare!

So, interested?*  \n  \n**___**  \n  \nI'm not the only one who didn't wanted this theme, as almost every LD for a long time. And it's not because I suggested the one wich reached the second place (not sure I would have made a better game with it), but because I don't like this kind of very restricted theme, wich leads to two or three main ideas, all the same for almost everyone, and it's very difficult to find something not that boring, to twist any of those first ideas - plus, here, some of the main ideas are weird or disgusting. So, without any surprise, I didn't came up with a satisfaying idea before late saturday night (much more sunday morning, in fact), just before going to bed. Fortunately, this was not too hard to program, so I managed to finish something playable in time, but, well, there is a lack of juicy things, no sound, only procedural graphics barely better than programer art, no story in game, and the balance is very approximative. I hope you will have at least a little fun playing it - I will have fun for sure trying yours.  \n:smile:  \n  \n**___**  \n  \nControls are on the game page, under the game.  \n  \nTips :  \n  \n‚Ä¢ All the obstacles make different damage (for ex. crates hurts more than lamps, but less than cactus - yes, the green things are cactus, I swear)  \n  \n‚Ä¢ The more you gain life, the more the difficulty raise, even for easy choice (the runs will be longer, and from times to times, the minimum bet will raise too)  \n  \n‚Ä¢ If you finish a run without losing any life, you'll gain a safe bonus (function of the run long, but same whatever the bet difficulty)  \n  \n‚Ä¢ Your best score is the longer life you reached. It's saved, even if you quit the game (as the *bookmaker* said, you can stop anytime :rolling_eyes:)  \n  \n**___**  \n  ","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b3/z/23401.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/life-bet","author":{"name":"LeReveur","uid":59,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b3/z/3d10.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/lereveur"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//b3/z/23401.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//b3/z/23401.png"}],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"http://workshop.xenedon.com/LD44/index.html"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Necropolis - City Management Game with Zombie","category":"jam","description":"You find yourself and 3 of your friends in a parking lot in the middle of the Zombie Apocalypse.

You wake up in a hospital because of the operation on the finger you almost cut off. It is now 3 days after the breakout. All you remember is that there was an accident in the nearby chemical lab and that something wrong happened. Every animal living in forests next to the lab were infected. No one knew that it was only the beginning of apocalypse. After this event, every TV and radio station reported more and more frequently about people being bitten by wild animals and falling into madness - acting a if they were predators hunting for meat constantly. There is not much time for anyone now. No one knows how many there are already... How long can you survive?\n\n# Gameplay\n\nYour objective is to survive as long as it is possible before the virus gets you. In order to do so, you need to complete quests to maintain health. You have limited amount of time to complete each of them. If you fail, your maximum value of health decreases. Weapons, as well as different types of enemies are scaterred around the whole map. Remember, there is not ammo. Different weapons use your health as ammo, each at different rate. Those are determined by their power and capabilities. Killing enemies refills some hit points back.\n\n## Controls\n- WASD/arrows - movement\n- mouse - aim\n- LMB - shoot\n- Mouse wheel - change weapon\n- E - pick up weapon\n\n## Enemies\n\n- TIER I:\n * Basic patient - every game needs this one enemy who is easy and pretty much useless (still don't underestimate the number of them)\n * Contagious patient - read above, little tougher with damage over time added\n * Alcoholic - many years in urban environment with everyday C2H5OH consumption resulted in lower speed with increased toughness\n\n- TIER II\n * Life-guard - guess what, read first one above, then bump up all statistics a bit\n * Narcoman - fast enemy with mediocre toughness that has low-damage and high-frequency attack\n * Wheelchair patient - what do you except from a guy in a wheelchair - he is slow, why is he then in TIER II if he is slow then? you guesed it - he is very tough\n\n- TIER III\n * Nurse - ok, we actually implemented something more than variations of the first type of enemy, slow but tough unit with high damage that has passive ability to heal others\nInjured soldier - again we come back to tweaking the first enemy's stats, tough with mediocre speed and powerful but slow attack\n * Bodyguard - now we actually, you won't believe, refer not to the first enemy type but to the Life-guard (who is actually referring to the first enemy type but shhhh), bump his stats a bit evenly\n * Freak - typical kamikaze guy - high speed, high damage, low toughness\n\n- TIER IV\n * Doctor - wow, now actually we have even more mechanics, high toughness with low speed and damage that boosts damage dealt by enemies nearby\n * Psychopath - you almost forgot about referring to the first guy, didn't ya? bump the last guy's stats more evenly\n * Psychologist - strong unit with mediocre toughness and speed\n\n- TIER V\n * DEER - BOSS, no spoilers\n\n# Credits\nCREDITS\n\n* Coding:\n - Eryk K≈õciuczyk\n - Miko≈Çaj Czarnecki\n - Micha≈Ç Danikiewicz\n - Andrzej Kominek\n - Grzegorz Koperwas\n\n* Balance:\n - Micha≈Ç Danikiewicz\n\n* Map design:\n - Andrzej Kominek\n\n* Animations:\n - Miko≈Çaj Czarnecki\n - Micha≈Ç Danikiewicz\n\n* Graphics:\n - Maja Oszczypa≈Ça\n - Maja Wiƒôzik\n\n* Sound effects and soundtrack:\n - Miko≈Çaj Czarnecki\n - Micha≈Ç Danikiwicz\n - Andrzej Kominek\n\n* Guide and credits designer:\n - Andrzej Kominek\n\n* Markdown edit:\n - Grzegorz Koperwas","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//3e4/42/z/22d3a.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/deer-zombie-hospital","author":{"name":"Eroar","uid":148707,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//3e4/42/z/2382a.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/eroar"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//3e4/42/z/2428b.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//3e4/42/z/2428b.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//3e4/42/z/24295.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//3e4/42/z/24295.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Source code","url":"https://github.com/HakierGrzonzo/Zombie-Deer-Hospital"},{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://gamejolt.com/games/plsWork/411409"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Have a Heart","category":"jam","description":"I ran out of time for this jam, here is my unfinished game.\n\nMade with Pico-8, Aseprite and autotracker-bottomup","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//dab/71/z/224f8.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/have-a-heart","author":{"name":"oda","uid":97197,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//dab/71/z/14eea.png","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/oda"},"screens":[],"links":[{"label":"HTML5 web","url":"https://oda.itch.io/ld44-have-a-heart"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["web"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Twilight Zone","category":"jam","description":"Good Ol' Grandma bleeding for her survival.\nMove with WS or arrows up/down, character aims at your mouse. \nEDIT: use the 'Z' key, not the 'W' key, french keyboard and such...\nVampires throw fruits at you, avoid them and pick them up once they reach the ground to gain life.\nMainwhile Werewolves attack you in waves, defend yourself !

Well, atleast it was a fun exercise in using the Godot Engine and in how loosing your mind, as the remaining time ticks away, influences your decision making in prefering bad architectural choices.\"\n![ld44_game_screenshot_v2.png](///raw/ef0/52/z/241e5.png)","thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//0f0/52/z/23209.png.480x384.fit.jpg","entry_url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/get-me-my-drones","author":{"name":"floxy","uid":151792,"avatar_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//0f0/52/z/20fa1.jpg","home_url":"https://ldjam.com/users/floxy"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"https://static.jam.vg/content//ef0/52/z/241e5.png.480x384.fit.jpg","full_url":"https://static.jam.vg/raw//ef0/52/z/241e5.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Linux","url":"https://akronsus.itch.io/ld44-get-me-my-drones"},{"label":"Windows","url":"https://akronsus.itch.io/ld44-get-me-my-drones"}],"ratings":[],"platforms":["linux","desktop","win"]},{"ld_issue":44,"title":"Spend your village - LD 44","category":"jam","description":"Round-based strategy game.

One Preview Video][level-one-preview-video]\n\n## Description\nThe theme for _Ludum Dare 44_ was...  \n> Your life is currency\n\nWe went for a simple, generic approach:  \n_You pay with your health to buy items._\n\nThe game is a _2D action-platformer_.  \nYour goal is simply to get to the end of each level.  \n\nThroughout the levels you will find _items_ which you can buy using your health as currency.  \n\nYou regain health by defeating enemies.  \n\nEach level acts as a _checkpoint_; when you die, you restart at the beginning of the level.  \nThe game will also automatically save your progress to a savefile, each time you beat a level or die.  \n\nAs always with our jam games, we never properly finish.  \nThis jam's game was _especially unfinished_.  \nIf you intend to check out our game, we recommend trying our post-jam version.  \n\nAfter the jam ended at the end of April, we continued working on the game  \nwith the goal to release a finished product (like always).  \nThis time, we are proud to say, that we _actually finished this game_!\n\n## Controls\nThe exact controls are specified in the file `resources/config/bindings.ron`.  \nYou can change bindings in this file however you want; the syntax _should_ be self-explanatory enough.  \nBut careful: if you make a syntax error, the game will crash.  \nSee the generated file `logs/panic.log` for error messages, if it crashes.\n\n__Note:__  \nFor the controller buttons we are using the Xbox naming scheme.  \nSo the `A` button would be the `X` button on a DualShock controller, etc.  \n\n| Action

If you want to find out for yourself and get brutally murdered in the process, than go straight to the download.\n\nFirst things first: You need to get the hang of the controls. Practice getting on top of the bank until you are able to do it easily. Also grab the money there. Start by upgrading the guard generator. Always prioritize this and the money generator. Do some of the other platformers and get the generator ASAP. You will need money in the later rounds once the money from the platforming challenges runs out. Remember to try and keep the guard generator 1 or 2 levels above the wave level just to be safe.
