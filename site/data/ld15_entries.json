I mean, caverns. \nHis experience is all up to Player 2 (he who wields the mouse), who designs the next level while player 1 crawls the previous one.\n\nThis is an experiment I've been wanting to try for a while, although I originally imagined it as a platformer. The idea is, hopefully, some interesting interactions will emerge between the people playing, kind of like how we used to take board game sets and invent completely new role-playing games from the pieces when I was a kid.\n\nI want to revisit the idea and try it with a few other genres some time soon.\n\n--------\n\nI've just updated the game to include saving/loading and 9 single player maps. So it's now possible to play solo.\nPlease note that this was added post-compo.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: this is in the readme, but worth mentioning again: the buttons at the bottom are operated with a double-click, so you can't accidentally wipe your level.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ab9c1b5cacb5f9495c5034d47ef06ef7.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-15/?action=preview&uid=734","author":{"name":"Radix","uid":734,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/30adca8d842a202a00eb7e05bdd6f220?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/radix/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/734-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/734-shot0.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.klikscene.com/games/Radix_LD15_2XUE.rar"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":1,"score":4.6},{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":27},{"area":"overall","rank":31,"score":3.48},{"area":"community","rank":32,"score":3.63},{"area":"graphics","rank":35,"score":3.48},{"area":"fun","rank":43,"score":3.22},{"area":"audio","rank":55,"score":2.73},{"area":"theme","rank":68,"score":3.24},{"area":"humor","rank":88,"score":2.13}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":15,"title":"Bat Cave Adventures!","category":"compo","description":"Sorry to anyone who's tried to download it already.

The idea was to do a rogue-ish (as opposed to a proper Rogue-like) game inspired by DoomRL.  I was at the Hand Eye Society Social in Toronto on Thursday and chatting with Raigan Burns (metanetsoftware.com) who was gushing about how cool DoomRL is,. so I was just playing it when this LD15 came along,. I had also been thinking about doing something along these lines anyway (although a bit different) and had been doing some experiments with map generation in the ZGE latley, so seemed like a good idea, to just set it in a cavern.  The perlin-noise plus some levels of convolution works well to make nice cavernous maps,. so I use that here.  Next I wanted to have some lighting effects as well as a way to give the AIs limited vision.  So I did a brute-force raycasting lighting setup,. and most of the workflow slowdown came from figuring where to store what data and how to pass it between things,. as I normaly just stick with the model structure built into ZGE and in this case the 'map' is an array that is drawn from a single model.  Anyway hacknicalties slowed me down and I did not get much gameplay in here,. so I just hacked in some quick synth sounds and a couple visual tricks for shts and giggles,. and here you have my little entry.\n\nI did have a much more 'game' like idea, however time was just too short for that,.(or i was too slow?) but I do have something to show anyhow. I also learned a bunch of interesting stuff and will likely rebuild this whole thing and develop a proper game from the experiance gained,. so a successfull LD15 for me ;)   ","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/edcefe03534efa5f12d48befdea4ac22.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-15/?action=preview&uid=848","author":{"name":"jph","uid":848,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f19904e15ed5030cbd2ac59d0417a17b?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/jph/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/848-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/848-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://d1319106.u48.nozonenet.com/InTheShadows__LD15.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://www.emix8.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2688#2688"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":15,"score":3.88},{"area":"audio","rank":21,"score":3.42},{"area":"community","rank":42,"score":3.45},{"area":"graphics","rank":62,"score":3.15},{"area":"overall","rank":74,"score":2.88},{"area":"innovation","rank":88,"score":2.68},{"area":"humor","rank":95,"score":2},{"area":"fun","rank":100,"score":2.44},{"area":"coolness","rank":111,"score":5}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":15,"title":"Lazor Dentist","category":"compo","description":"Enter the world of the future dentist!\n\nThis is a game about miniature, laser-shooting dentists who operate within the cavern of your mouth.

Well, that was fun! Not! No, it was actually.\n\nI noticed a number of people were a little confused with how to play my entry Brinie, so I thought I would offer a quick guide to the game. It's funny, I just assumed everyone would pick it up through playing it a little bit.\n\nOk, when the game starts, you should see Brinie, a net, and a bunch of things that look like fleas. These are the Grags. They live to eat, pretty much anything and everything. As Brinie is the only thing out there, you will see them start to chase her around. When they touch her, they begin feeding off of her. When they eat all they can, they will go off and cruise, but not before having a baby.  In this way, very quickly 10 Grags can become 100 Grags and 100 Grags can become 1000 Grags. If enough Grags get to Brinie, they will very quickly kill her off.\n\nYou have three options to try to save Brinie.\n\n1) Drop a Gauloop somewhere on the playfield. It is a hive of small noisy creatures. These are like bait. They have a strong smell and may attract Grags away from Brinie. In the same way, Brinie doesn't like the smell of the Gauloop so it may repel her a bit. You can use these to try to get her to go where you want, or if not that, at least keep her away from certain places. The problem with Gauloops is that Grags feed off them and will quickly devour them and cause the ranks of Grags to grow greatly.\n\n2) Drop a Pauper somewhere on the playfield. A pauper is like a Gauloop, and it has a much stronger smell, but it doesn't feed them nearly as well. What it does do is after a few seconds, it explodes, killing all Grags in the area. If positioned properly, this can be used to wipe out a huge population of Grags. The drawback is that Grags love to eat dead Grags, and a few living Grags will find the carnage a great feasting area and may quickly multiple their ranks back up.\n\n3) Use your Net to capture Brinie. When Brinie is completely on the net, simply press the capture button and you win the game. The net also has the effect of killing any Grags on it at the time it is pressed. This fact can be used in combination with 1) and 2) to really wipe out the Grags. It is a great and difficult (and not necessary) accomplishment to completely wipe out the Grags, but it is possible and quite a fun challenge.\n\nNow you are limited to 9 Gauloops, 6 Paupers and 3 Net captures, so use them wisely. Also, you can only have up to 3 gauloops and 1 pauper on the playfield at one time, so that is a consideration as well.\n\nI used the language Processing for this entry. It was pretty much the first time I tried to use the language for anything. Got to say, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Don't recommend trying to learn a language and make a game in 48 hours though.\n\nAll three versions (windows, mac os x, and linux) are compressed into Rar file.

Here's the end-result of a lot of learning and not so much gameplay coding!\n\nMy original goal was to create a pong game inside a cavern, with deformed walls and rocks in the way, mixing things up. I didn't manage to get deformed walls, but at least there's a bunch of rocks to make it a bit different. I didn't of course settle for just any physics simulation, but picked PhysX because there seemed to be a good Ogre wrapper for it (NxOgre). Before this weekend I hadn't done anything with Ogre, PhysX or Blender, so it's been quite a productive learning experience, probably more suited for a MiniLD weekend though...

And you're not alone.\n\n------\n\nTO RUN:\nWorked out the problem I was having making an executable, now there is one, so just run it!  Not sure about compatibility, so good luck!\nAlso, sound is very important, although quiet at times, so speakers or headphones should be used.\n\n-About-\nI wasn't actually intending to even participate in this Ludum Dare, but in mucking around with LOVE and lua for the first time I just kept tinkering and ended up with this.  Because of that it was very much made up as I went along, and it could have been much better if I knew what I was doing at the beginning. There's a few glitchy alignments, but I do rather like how the torch turned out (albeit horribly inefficiently done).  I'm also not sure how well (if at all) it'll run on other computers, was silly enough to only test it on my own.\n\nAnyway, it's pretty short and simple, randomly generated cave, you need to get out and you don't want to meet the other occupant.  Was going for a bit of a spooky running-from-unseen-horror sort of thing, and to that degree I feel it could have been much better with a unwinding story and specifically designed map.  Really this just turned into a sort of proof of concept (like so many LD entries seem to end up).  It worked out OK, though I've no idea if it's actually playable or fun after play/making it past being able to see the game anymore.\n\nIf you want to try it I'd suggest the normal sized cave, I just put the larger option in because the code allowed for it.  The cavern tend to be pretty square, so normally  the best option is to head to a side and start going around it.  Or of course you can go looking for and avoiding the sounds (after a few plays through you'll know what noise to avoid).  \n\nFinally, if you're not able to find the exit no matter what, try pressing 'm'.  It's amazing how easy things are when you know where everything is!\n\n-OTHER STUFF-\nCoded in lua script using LOVE\nNotepad++ used for editing\nMade some sprites too\nHad fun\nGrabbed some sound from freesound.org, in particular from users starpause, HardPCM, and sagetyrtle\nThe executable can actually be opened in an archiver to get to the source, but I up'd the straight source too","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/3fe8bbb5f8fc6b67a5a8487186af6ed3.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-15/?action=preview&uid=1190","author":{"name":"Six","uid":1190,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c9c4fb59063de7d74aca2b4f02506e52?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/six/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/1190-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/1190-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/1190-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/1190-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/1190-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/1190-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/1190-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/1190-shot3.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/1190-shot4.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/1190-shot4.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://sixsided.googlepages.com/Lurking-executable.zip"},{"label":"Source","url":"http://sixsided.googlepages.com/Lurking.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":3,"score":27},{"area":"theme","rank":9,"score":4.06},{"area":"audio","rank":24,"score":3.38},{"area":"innovation","rank":28,"score":3.46},{"area":"graphics","rank":32,"score":3.53},{"area":"overall","rank":38,"score":3.39},{"area":"fun","rank":46,"score":3.2},{"area":"humor","rank":92,"score":2.07},{"area":"community","rank":99,"score":2.29}],"platforms":["win","desktop"]},{"ld_issue":15,"title":"NICE CAVE!","category":"compo","description":"","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/bc0d87283a416c83ff3842f867ab00db.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-15/?action=preview&uid=472","author":{"name":"dock","uid":472,"avatar_url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9e86dac2616701d38e4e637a78fbdc90?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/dock/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/472-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/472-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://deadpanda.com/lj/dock-ld15windows.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://deadpanda.com/lj/dock-ld15mac.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://deadpanda.com/lj/ld15submit.html"}],"ratings":[{"area":"theme","rank":3,"score":4.27},{"area":"humor","rank":4,"score":3.84},{"area":"overall","rank":6,"score":3.86},{"area":"community","rank":6,"score":4.15},{"area":"graphics","rank":8,"score":4.26},{"area":"fun","rank":20,"score":3.56},{"area":"audio","rank":55,"score":2.73},{"area":"coolness","rank":74,"score":17},{"area":"innovation","rank":78,"score":2.8}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","web"]},{"ld_issue":15,"title":"Refuge","category":"compo","description":"The world has been overrun by alien invaders, and humans have taken to the depths of the earth to escape the scourge.

It is top down but gravity may may be in any direction or completely off. Also you cant move, instead you must throw stones at special bricks to activate their directed gravity field which will push you around.\n\nIt is made with Panda3D and will therefore run from source on almost all platforms if Panda3D is installed. The game when compiled into an installer was 57mb for Windows which is too large to host on my website for everyone so you will just have to enjoy running this from source. This also means that you are able the create new levels because the level file format is just a python file which calls simple methods on the level object.\n\nThere are only 3 levels because time was tight, but at least 2 out of the 3 will challenge you I hope.\n\n---About Panda3D---\nFor those of you who avoid downloading extra engines just to run games I ask you: Have you not looked at this engine for use in your own games? It's so feature complete I must assume that you have simply never heard of it. EVERYONE I know who has looked into its capabilities has decided that there is no better engine to develop with. I hope you all enjoyed using what you did but more so I hope you will heed this advice that this is an engine worth using. This is my first 2D game using Panda3D, my others were an FPS and a Little Big Planet clone using Panda3D's builtin ODE Physics.","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/98f5702e5f3800d38e24a8a38286c5ce.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-15/?action=preview&uid=1012","author":{"name":"Tange","uid":1012,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/18ef38105aa3bfeb5ff530b959191d8a?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/tange/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/1012-shot0.jpg-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/1012-shot0.jpg"}],"links":[{"label":"Source","url":"http://protonode.com/gfx/gravcaverngame.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":88,"score":10},{"area":"audio","rank":102,"score":1.6},{"area":"community","rank":102,"score":2.23},{"area":"innovation","rank":103,"score":2.43},{"area":"graphics","rank":111,"score":2.38},{"area":"humor","rank":115,"score":1.8},{"area":"overall","rank":136,"score":2},{"area":"fun","rank":140,"score":1.57},{"area":"theme","rank":141,"score":1.71}],"platforms":[]},{"ld_issue":15,"title":"Into the Pit: The Endless Caverns","category":"compo","description":"Into the Pit is a game heavily-inspired by level 2 of the original Battletoads for the NES.

If one falls on an ant or a bat, you get extra points. When it lands, the cavern shakes, and may dislodge other stalactites.\n\nStalagmites are merely obstacles.\n\nAnts rest on the ground. They fire multiple non-homing shots in the air. As the game progresses, they fire more shots faster and with greater frequency. Ants can be killed with sustained fire.\n\nBats rest on the ceiling.

Le sigh. Still, got some good progress!\n\nWindows and OS X builds are now up! Enjoy! Also, the windows build should now actually *work*.\n\nThe idea was the to make a game in the style of Advance Wars or Final Fantasy Tactics, taking place underground, involving warring armies of mole people and, eventually, other underground nasties.\n\nThe mouse-driven menu system is pretty terrible (as some of the comments below will attest). In fact, nearly every action in the game has a keyboard equivalent for the menu items. Unfortunately, key equivalent assignment is incredibly haphazard, since I ran out of time well before I got to going back and fixing them up. For the main action menu, it's the first letter of the action (M for Move, D for Dig, A for Attack). For choosing a destination square, you must use the mouse (only action in the game that requires the mouse). OK/Cancel is always enter and escape, respectively. Choosing a dig pattern can be done with the number keys (1 for the first pattern, 2 for the second). Choosing a dig direction is the arrow keys, or NWSE for North/south/east/west. Choosing an attack target is the arrow keys.\n\nI do intend to improve all that, when I continue to work on this in the future. But for the compo voting, unfortunately the controls are pretty terrible. Sorry for that.\n\nNote also that the source I have posted now is slightly different from what I had posted originally. I had actually posted the wrong source at the time, missing two hours of work that were done within the time limit but accidentally left out of the submission.

No need to tap button.\n- You generate more lift when you aren't moving left or right. Just flap without a direction and you will fly upward.

He is more powerful, the ice around him melts faster, which is useful but also dangerous.\n\nGame is simple right now. Level is randomly generated, jump around until find sunstone or die, repeat.

v0.5\n\nWell this is the version 0.5\nHas music and some sound effects and a lot more of life.\n\n--------------------\n\n2009/08/29\n\nThere is not much of a background, the idea struck me today around 10AM and what I've achieved so far is the thing I'm posting.\n\nI don't want to disclose any gameplay info or tips because it's meant to be experimented with.\nYou can change the cavern with the mouse and the palette in the bottom in different ways... you'll start seeing some interesting stuff soon!\n\nIt was made in AS3 using the Flixel library.\nI used Graphics Gale for the graphics.\n\nI hope you enjoy it!\n-Martin\n\n\n\n","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/59c3e3ef8dcde5b5a5315b276bbc8d71.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-15/?action=preview&uid=937","author":{"name":"nitram_cero","uid":937,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/577b26727c8f63d561cd02feb58039c8?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/nitram_cero/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/937-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/937-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/937-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/937-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/937-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/937-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/937-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/937-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.tbam.com.ar/play--caverns-ld48.php"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://www.tbam.com.ar/play--caverns-ld48.php"},{"label":"Linux","url":"http://www.tbam.com.ar/play--caverns-ld48.php"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.tbam.com.ar/play--caverns-ld48.php"}],"ratings":[{"area":"innovation","rank":4,"score":4.16},{"area":"overall","rank":9,"score":3.78},{"area":"theme","rank":22,"score":3.73},{"area":"audio","rank":22,"score":3.41},{"area":"graphics","rank":24,"score":3.69},{"area":"fun","rank":53,"score":3.12},{"area":"humor","rank":63,"score":2.45},{"area":"community","rank":91,"score":2.42},{"area":"coolness","rank":105,"score":6}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","linux","web"]},{"ld_issue":15,"title":"Cevern0048","category":"compo","description":"I cant test the osx build so if its duff let me know plz ^_^\n\ninstructions are in the game, thanks for checking/voting :)","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b3346181cf2d8b51838bcbf37c8de356.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-15/?action=preview&uid=36","author":{"name":"Sophie Houlden","uid":36,"avatar_url":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/43f4eabf61d60f145ba1e65910b5c402?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/girlflash/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/36-shot0.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/36-shot0.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/36-shot1.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/36-shot1.PNG"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/36-shot2.PNG-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/36-shot2.PNG"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows","url":"http://www.sophiehoulden.com/games/cavern0048/Caver0048_win.zip"},{"label":"OS/X","url":"http://www.sophiehoulden.com/games/cavern0048/Cavern0048_osx.zip"},{"label":"Web","url":"http://www.sophiehoulden.com/games/cavern0048/"},{"label":"Source(Unity Project)","url":"http://www.sophiehoulden.com/games/cavern0048/Cavern0048_project_files.zip"}],"ratings":[{"area":"community","rank":4,"score":4.31},{"area":"overall","rank":5,"score":3.87},{"area":"graphics","rank":6,"score":4.44},{"area":"fun","rank":16,"score":3.66},{"area":"theme","rank":19,"score":3.79},{"area":"innovation","rank":48,"score":3.24},{"area":"audio","rank":70,"score":2.45},{"area":"coolness","rank":70,"score":19},{"area":"humor","rank":76,"score":2.29}],"platforms":["win","desktop","mac","web"]},{"ld_issue":15,"title":"Dwarven Rock Smash","category":"compo","description":"My first entry into LD48.\n\nTake control of a Dwarf and smash up some rocks!\n\nThere are little tips at the start of each round.

LD15\n--------------------------\nSteven \"Stuckie\" Campbell\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**\nIf it runs too fast on Windows, PLEASE make sure you're using the Fixed EXE, for the reasons explained below - I buggered up the submission somewhat, and you're using an OLD EXE.\nThe easy way to test this is if there's any sound or not.. if there's no sound, you're using the WRONG version!\n\nPlot:\nWe've been doing research around the Moons of Subterrane for a while now, though unfortunately the locals have decided they're not too happy about it anymore.\n\nThey've unleashed a horde of vicious monsters into the caves we have been researching in.\nYour job is to clear these caves and rescue our researchers.\nOf course, the natives have also managed to destabalise each sector of the Moon we're in, so you've only got a set amount of time before it tears itself apart!\n\nYou ship is controlled via the Arrow Keys.\nZ acts as a firing mechanism.\nX will transport researchers between your ship and whatever station you've landed on.\n\nGood Luck!\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nOh the fun this was.\nI probably only spent about 24 hours on it max... wouldn't be too hard to extend either.\n\nSounds were done in MilkyTracker via messing with the debug log as a sample source ;)\nGraphics in GIMP.\nCode in Lua mostly, with some engine tweaks in C/C++\nThe engine does run on the Wiz and Dingoo, but I don't think I've got the buttons mapped, so it may run but not do anything.\n\nFull source code is provided though!\n\nI only managed to properly map out Chronos and the first two sectors of Kala.\nThe rest are repeats of Chronos with random gravity values, and different tilemaps ( colour shifts, wooo )\n\nHope you enjoy it :)\nBuilt and tested on Windows 7 and Gentoo Linux AMD64\n\n--edit--\nOops I forgot to mention two controls!\nLanding on a manned station will repair your ship.\nHolding down while doing this will speed up the repair - and your main station outside the caves will repair you much faster than the smaller ones inside.\n\nAnd to pause, press return.\nThis is also used for restarting the game once the time runs out, and for ending the game at the end screen.\n\n-- Dingoo Notes --\nI had to do some more fiddling to get it to play on the Dingoo... as such, Player.lua was edited in the scripts, and some control stuff was messed with.\nControls:\nDpad - move\nB - Fire\nY - Transport\nStart - Pause\nSelect - Quit\n\nIt's a fair bit slower too.. and no sound.. but, for an extra five mins work, better than nothing!\n\n-- GP2X-Wiz Notes --\nControls are somewhat mangled due to the GP2X and Wiz sharing the strange \"diagonals are buttons too!\" philosophy..  however, it does run ( and faster than the dingoo! )\n\nDPAD - ship movement.\nX - Fire\nA - Transport\nMENU - Pause\nPOWER-SWITCH - Quit ;) sorry... I forgot!\n\nA better controlled version will appear (much) later, but that's my quick ports down just now!\n\nSource changes for the ports are included, so you can see what was edited from the main entry.\n\n--Win32 Notes--\nIn the main package above, I included an OLD exe ( has no sound, and no frame lock ) ... I uploaded a fixed exe which you should use. Amusingly, if you re-compiled off the source included in the zip, you'd get the correct exe ( which this is ) ... apologies for that! Lack of sleep and being ill really didn't help.\n\n-- Extra Help For Those Stuck At What To Do --\nThe point of the game is to land on each station in the caves, and Transport the researchers from that point to your main base outside the cave.\nYou do this by landing on the station, pressing down, and X on PC.\nYou'll see your Researchers counter change from ( in the first level ) 0/0/5 to 0/1/4 indicating that you've rescued 0, have 1 in transit, with 4 remaining.\nTransport them to your base outside the caves, land, press down and X again, and your researchers status should change to 1/0/4 - showing you've rescued one, have 0 in transit with 4 remaining.\nIf a station has no more researchers left, it dims ( and the landing pad's hazard lines go from yellow to red. )\nEach station you land at also restrengthens your shield if they're active ( you can speed this up by holding down ), and marks a respawn point, so should you die, you'll respawn there rather than on your base.\nYou can also transport a researcher back to a station - main point of doing this is if you need to top up your shield after going too deep into the caves, and still too far from your main base.\n\nOnce you rescue/kill ( if you die with a researcher in transit, they die too ) all researchers on that sector, you'll get a \"GET OFF THE MOON\" message, to which just fly outside the cave and straight up, or to the left. You'll then be taken to either the next sector of that moon, or the next moon if you've completed all 5 sectors.\n\n-- Survival Hints --\nAlthough killing everything in sight is good for points, some sectors are tight on time, and your main task is to save those researchers! Your best best is finding them all and moving them to a station near the exit first, and then blasting everything to bits.\n\nBe warned that if the timer comes under 75 units, the moon starts to destabalise, making it trickier to see what's going on as the timer ticks ever closer to zero.\n\nHope that helps those confused as to what's going on!\n\n-- Stuckie","thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a7a216ec3e241cfeae34215b275c4be3.jpg","entry_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-15/?action=preview&uid=267","author":{"name":"stuckie","uid":267,"avatar_url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/25cb1d0e8a5f1f7fd0e16b55254090fa?s=56&d=mm&r=g","home_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/stuckie/"},"screens":[{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/267-shot0.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/267-shot0.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/267-shot1.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/267-shot1.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/267-shot2.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/267-shot2.png"},{"thumbnail_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/267-shot3.png-crop-180-140.jpg","full_url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/6952/267-shot3.png"}],"links":[{"label":"Windows/Linux(AMD64)/Source","url":"http://www.stuckiegamez.co.uk/gamez/ludumdare/ld15/MoonsOfSubterrane-LD15.7z"},{"label":"Dingoo A320","url":"http://www.stuckiegamez.co.uk/gamez/ludumdare/ld15/MoonsOfSubterraneLD15-Dingoo.7z"},{"label":"GP2X-Wiz","url":"http://www.stuckiegamez.co.uk/gamez/ludumdare/ld15/MoonsOfSubterraneLD15-Wiz.7z"},{"label":"Fixed Win32 Binary","url":"http://www.stuckiegamez.co.uk/gamez/ludumdare/ld15/SGZ2D.exe"}],"ratings":[{"area":"coolness","rank":2,"score":58},{"area":"community","rank":45,"score":3.41},{"area":"fun","rank":55,"score":3.05},{"area":"innovation","rank":61,"score":2.95},{"area":"overall","rank":78,"score":2.87},{"area":"theme","rank":81,"score":3.1},{"area":"audio","rank":82,"score":2.15},{"area":"graphics","rank":85,"score":2.74},{"area":"humor","rank":90,"score":2.11}],"platforms":["win","desktop","linux"]},{"ld_issue":15,"title":"Polluted Caverns","category":"compo","description":"Here's my unfinished entry.

Thanks a lot for trying the game even though I didnt finish it!  Yes it's lacking by definition since it's incomplete.  I do appreciate all the comments.\n2. Oh boy, the installer. Unfortunately, it's the nature of the beast with XNA since it has a ton of dependencies.  You can skip those installs if you know you have a particular package, most likely everyone has everything but the XNA redists but I didnt want to take chances on a time sensitive project and wanted people to run it clean.  I did have a silent version for some other projects but it hung in some instances so I made it verbose.  I apologize to those that strongly prefer zip dumps.\n3.  Yes, my codebase requires SM2.0.  I'm not sure why it blocks some people for only one instance and then it allows it after, but that would explain any graphical glitches.\n4.  Yes Mediafire, so?
